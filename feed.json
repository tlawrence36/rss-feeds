      "Military historian Rick Atkinson, known for his Revolutionary War trilogy, is venturing into graphic books",
      "NEW YORK -- Prize-winning military historian Rick Atkinson, a comic book fan growing up, hadn't imagined his own work being suitable for the illustrated format.",
      "Ten Speed Graphic announced Tuesday that a graphic edition of \u201cThe British Are Coming,\u201d the first volume of Atkinson's acclaimed Revolutionary War trilogy, will be out next June, shortly before the country's 250th anniversary. Five more graphic books are planned, to be written by Nora Neus and illustrated by Federico Pietrobon, with Atkinson in close collaboration.",
      "\u201cThey are entirely amenable to my suggestions, \u2018This isn\u2019t quite right,\u2019 or \u2018I think this needs to be explained,\u2019\u201d Atkinson told The Associated Press. \u201cWith the drawings, I pointed out that John Adams, at the time the revolution began was a relatively young man. And they had made him look like the paunchy, bald John Adams of the vice presidency. And they fixed it.\u201d",
      "Atkinson, a Pulitzer Prize winner for his World War II book \u201cAn Army at Dawn,\u201d has been working on his revolutionary trilogy for a decade and published the second volume, \u201cThe Fate of the Day,\u201d this spring. Widely regarded as among the best living military historians, he was a featured commentator in Ken Burns' \u201cThe American Revolution\u201d documentary and has made numerous joint appearances with the filmmaker. He is currently working on the final book of his trilogy.",

      "The author says that he was initially skeptical about the new project.

But the graphic format has been used on everything from \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d to the drafting of the U.S. Constitution. Atkinson changed his mind after Ten Speed Graphic, a Penguin Random House imprint, sent him several adaptations, including of the life of Frederick Douglass and Timothy Snyder's \u201cOn Tyranny.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw that the comic books of my youth have evolved considerably and I was enthused about it,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cThey said, \u2018We acknowledge this is serious history that you do. We don\u2019t intend to dumb it down. Our ambition is to widen the audience, to pitch this story of the American founding to an audience that perhaps might be intimidated by a 560 page book.'\u201d",

Though most of his fame came from roles in which he embodied the archetype of a larger-than-life hero \u2014 upright, patriotic and fearless \u2014 his charming performances in romantic hits equally made him popular with the masses.",

Dharmendra had married Prakash Kaur before his film debut, and went on to have four children with her, including two who would follow in his acting footsteps \u2014 Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol.",
      "Despite his marriage to Malini in 1980, he reportedly never divorced Kaur and continued to live with her. According to local media reports, he briefly converted to Islam before marrying Malini as Indian law disallows Hindus to marry twice, especially if their spouse is alive.",

      "Jon M. Chu directed both \u201cWicked\u201d films, starring Cynthia Ervio and Ariana Grande. The first film made over $758.7 million worldwide and received 10 Oscar nominations (winning two, for costume and production design ). The question is how high \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d can soar.

A decade later, he helped reggae ascend to the international stage with his starring role in the cult favorite \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d and his featured place on the film's classic soundtrack.

      "Like Marvin Gaye's \u201cWhat's Going On\u201d and other anti-war songs, Cliff's \u201cVietnam\u201d was drawn from the horrors of those who had served overseas. \u201cVietnam\u201d was a seething, mid-tempo chant \u2014 \u201cVi-et-nam, Vi-et-nam,\u201d the very name an indictment, in this song for the death of a soldier who had written home to say he would soon be returning, only for his mother to receive a telegram the next day announcing his death.",
      "One of Cliff's many talents was looking clear-eyed at life as it is, and imagining so well what it could be \u2014 a paradise made real by the melody, the feel and lyrics of \u201cWonderful World, Beautiful People,\u201d a vision so inevitable even the likes of President Richard Nixon and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson can't get in the way. \u201cThis is our world, can\u2019t you see? / Everybody wants to live and be free.\u201d",

      "Cliff\u2019s political songs were so enduring in part because they were so catchy, and because they offered hope without the promise of easy success. Kicked off by a spare horn riff, \u201cYou Can Get It If You Really Want\u201d has a lighter mood than \u201cVietnam,\u201d but just as determined a spirit. \u201cYou must try, try and try, try and try,\u201d Cliff warns. \u201cPersecution you must fear / Win or lose you got to get your share.\u201d",
      "The title track to the movie which would mark the high point of his success, \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d has a spiky, muscular rhythm, the kind you could set to the forward march of a mass protest. It\u2019s a sermon of retribution for oppressors \u2014 \u201cthe harder they fall, one and all\u201d \u2014 and of earthly rewards for those who have been robbed: \u201cSo as sure as the sun will shine / I\u2019m gonna get my share now, what\u2019s mine.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "\"Wicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a fresh take on the original musical's second act",
      "Are you ready for more \u201cWicked\"? \u201cWicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a bulked-up take on the music of the original \u201cWicked\u201d musical's second act, grounded in yet-again stellar vocals from Cynthia Erivo as a misunderstood but defiant Elphaba and Ariana Grande as a conflicted but changing Glinda. New songs and lyrics raise the stakes \u2014 even if the music itself is at times weighed down by the plot it helps move along, like the film it accompanies.",
      "The soundtrack opens with \u201cEvery Day More Wicked,\u201d a lengthened-version of a section of the original Act 2 opener \u201cThank Goodness\u201d with new verses about Elphaba's perceived wickedness and Glinda's presumed goodness set to bold orchestration that matches the first film's opening number, \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked.\" Drum beats and ensemble singers are the world builders here, twisting the melody into a march.",
      "The album's first solo goes to Michelle Yeoh's Madame Morrible, the sorceress at the center of a propaganda campaign against Elphaba \u2014 a choice that works for the plot, but which offsets the power of Erivo and Grande's forthcoming vocals. They are introduced later, through brief interpolations of the Act 1 showstoppers \u201cThe Wizard and I\" and \u201cPopular.\" All of that makes for a dynamic film opener \u2014 but is more fractured in audio form, sans the sumptuous visuals and character reveals that tie those musical references together on screen.",
      "Fortunately, \u201cThank Goodness / I Couldn't Be Happier\u201d quickly follows, bringing Grande center-stage \u2014 and providing a rare-here opportunity for her soprano head-voice to give way to a deeper belt (her passionate tone, like other Glindas before her, turns this almost nonsensical lyric, \"There are bridges you cross you didn\u2019t know you crossed until you've crossed them,\" into a revelation). That's not the last we hear from this capital \u201cG\u201d Good, Glinda. \u201cWonderful,\u201d usually a duet between Elphaba and the Wizard of Oz, is \u2018Galinda-fied,\u2019 with Grande adding welcome harmonies \u2014 and a brief \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d interlude \u2014 to Jeff Goldblum's Wizard romp.",
      "It was always going to be hard for this album to live up to the soundtrack of the first \u201cWicked,\u201d which ended with Erivo\u2019s take on the iconic \u201cDefying Gravity\" battle cry, and saw Grande own the over-the-top glitz of \u201cPopular.\" But that grandness is replicated in key moments: In Grande's operatic soprano, in Erivo and Jonathan Bailey's sensual \u201cAs Long As You're Mine,\" in which Bailey as Fiyero manages to keep up with Erivo's beckoning vocals, and in \u201cNo Good Deed,\" the album's sonic peak.",
      "At 44 minutes and 52 seconds, the soundtrack adds over 15 minutes of music to the runtime of the original Broadway cast recording's second act. That includes two brand new songs written for the film (making them eligible for Oscar consideration), one for Erivo\u2019s Elphaba and one for Grande\u2019s Glinda. In lengthening the shorter second act into a 2 hour and 17 minute long film, director Jon M. Chu stretches some of these songs across scenes, filling them out with dialogue, additional verses from composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and additional scoring from composer John Powell. All of that is a double-edged sword (broom? wand?), at times deflating the power of the tight original tracks, at others adding felt emotional stakes ripe for satisfying listening.",
      "For example: Some of the drama of Marissa Bode, Ethan Slater and Erivo's \u201cWicked Witch of the East,\u201d a song performed on Broadway that was also left off the original cast recording, is weakened by which pieces of the interspersed dialogue remain, and which don't, in the soundtrack version of the song. Like the Tin Man, it feels a bit piecemeal.",
      "But the new tracks are highlights, fleshing out the album. Erivo's \u201cNo Place Like Home\u201d pulls on the iconic line said by Dorothy in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\" providing this Oz-inspired show its take on the theme, like another Oz-inspired show, \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d found before. (\"Home,\" that show's nod to the line, was sung by Erivo at this year's Oscars ceremony). The song is the most inherently political, a timely tale of borders, defiance and community. It starts with Erivo's voice almost isolated, strings swelling behind her, and ends with the first of her transcendent vocal runs, restored to a full open note (after being cut short by the Cowardly Lion on screen) in the album.",
      "That power is felt tenfold in Erivo's take on \u201cNo Good Deed.\" The film may belong to Glinda\u2019s emotional trajectory, but it is Erivo who steals the soundtrack's climax. Drums return as the agony heard in her voice intensifies, the strings crescendoing with her final call.",
      "Glinda's emotional journey may at first be more subtle, but Grande portrays it deftly. Airy and introspective, \u201cGirl in the Bubble\u201d serves as turning point, filling in gaps about Glinda's internal reckoning. Her voice is restrained but emotional, Schwartz's lyrics straightforward with a cheese that feels earned, and thus earnest. This is Glinda after all, not Grande.",
      "Both songs boost the emotional payoff of the character\u2019s finale duet, the fan-beloved tear-jerker \u201cFor Good.\" And it's no surprise, years into their own journey with the characters, that Erivo and Grande nail the chemistry of their character's friendship.",

      "Warner Music Group has resolved its copyright dispute with Udio and signed a deal to collaborate on a new AI song creation service",
      "LONDON -- Warner Music Group resolved its copyright battle with Udio and signed a deal to work with the AI music startup on a new song creation service that will allow users to remix tunes by established artists.",
      "It's the second agreement between a major record label and Udio, a chatbot-style song generation tool.",
      "The deals underline how AI is shaking up the music industry. AI-generated music has been flooding streaming services amid the rise of song generators that instantly spit out new tunes based on prompts typed in by users without any musical knowledge. The synthetic music boom has also resulted in a wave of AI singers and bands that have climbed the charts after racking up millions of streams, even though they don't exist in real life.",
      "Warner, which represents artists including Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa, has resolved its copyright infringement litigation against Udio, the two companies said. They've also established \u201da clear framework\" for developing Udio\u2019s licensed AI music creation service that's set to launch in 2026.",
      "They provided no financial details on their agreement, which includes Warner's recording and publishing businesses, but it will create \u201cnew revenue streams for artists and songwriters, while ensuring their work remains protected.\"",

      "Natalie Paine is a French horn player in New Zealand\u2019s navy who since October has been among 21 military members stationed in Antarctica. There, her melodies drift across the frozen Ross Sea from perhaps the most remote practice room on Earth.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful and very inspiring,\u201d Paine told the Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019ll sit there by the window and I will do my routine and play music in my time off, which is not very often.\u201d",
      "The story of how she arrived in Antarctica is an unlikely one. Paine grew up in the hot, dry climate of Adelaide, Australia, where she dreamed of visiting the frozen continent as a scientist.",
      "She studied music at university instead, putting Antarctica out of her mind. Years later however, as a musician in New Zealand\u2019s navy, Paine learned members of the country\u2019s military were stationed in Antarctica to support the work of scientists.",

      "Her dream was revived but enacting it wasn\u2019t simple. It took four years of unsuccessful applications before Paine landed a posting as a communications operator.",
      "It\u2019s a consuming job, worked in six-day stretches that leave little time for music. Paine monitors radio, phone, email and other communications traffic at New Zealand\u2019s mission at Scott Base, sometimes speaking to people on the ice who haven\u2019t heard other voices for weeks.",
      "In whatever window she can find, Paine squeezes in scales and mouth exercises, going to great lengths not to disturb others on round-the-clock shifts. That means slipping out of the main base to a hut built in 1957 under the leadership of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary as New Zealand established its presence in Antarctica.",
      "While she plays by the window, watching seals on the ice, Paine finds new musical motifs bubbling up.",

      "Rosal\u00eda has won over millions of music lovers for her fusions of flamenco and urban Latin beats",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- And Rosal\u00eda said, \u201cLet there be Lux.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda, the global Spanish pop star loved by millions for fusing flamenco with Latin hip-hop and reggaeton, has amazed her fans with a radical shift.",
      "The singer and songwriter\u2019s new album, \u201cLux\u201d (\u201cLight\u201d in Latin), is unabashedly spiritual. Fifteen songs, sung in 13 different languages, including fragments in Latin, Arabic and Hebrew, are laden with a yearning for the divine.",
      "And it is receiving praise from on high.",
      "Xabier G\u00f3mez Garc\u00eda, bishop of Sant Feliu de Llobregat which includes Rosal\u00eda\u2019s hometown of Sant Esteve Sesrovires near Barcelona, was one of the first church leaders to laud her work in an open letter to his flock. Rosal\u00eda\u2019s grandmother regularly attends mass in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, according to the diocese.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, G\u00f3mez said that while some of her songs were \u201cprovocative,\u201d Rosal\u00eda \u201cspeaks with absolute freedom and without hang-ups about what she feels God to be, and the desire, the thirst (to know God).\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I listened to \u2018Lux\u2019 and Rosal\u00eda speaking about her the context of her album and the creative process, I found myself faced with a process and a work that transcended the musical. Here was a spiritual search through the testimonies of women of immense spiritual maturity,\u201d he said.",
      "From her opening lyrics sung over piano and mournful cello, \u201cWho could live between the two/ First love the world and later love God,\u201d Rosal\u00eda announces that this album is a rupture from its Grammy-winning predecessors. \u201cEl mal querer (\u00a8The Bad Loving\u201d in Spanish) and \u201c Motomami \" had established Rosal\u00eda as one of the leading artists in the Spanish music world with her experimental urban beats.",
      "Despite \u2014 or thanks to \u2014 its diversity of styles and song forms, ranging from classical strings, snippets of electronica with a cameo by Bj\u00f6rk, a boys' choir from a thousand-year-old monastery, an aria-like song in Italian, a Portuguese fado and, of course, modern flamenco and hip-hop beats, \u201cLux\u201d is off to a powerful start among listeners. It has four songs in Spotify\u2019s Top 50 global chart for this week, more than any artist, including Taylor Swift.",
      "Madonna has declared herself a fan of \"Lux,\" and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has lavishly called it the \u201calbum of the decade.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda, 33, has said that after her success in more popular music forms, she let her long-held longing for the spiritual guide her in making \u201cLux.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the end, in an age that seems not to be the age of faith or certainty or truth, there is more need than ever for a faith, or a certainty, or a truth,\" she told reporters in Mexico City last month.",
      "She said that she was guided by the concept that \u201can artist doubts less of his vocation when he works in the service of God than when he works in the service of him or herself.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda apparently has not had a revelatory \u201ccome-to-Jesus\u201d moment common among evangelical believers in America. Like many Spaniards, she grew up in a once staunchly Catholic Spain that has quickly secularized in recent decades, especially among the younger generations, leaving churches mostly to elderly parishioners.",
      "Even her early music flirted with medieval religious poetry, including one video clip from 2017 when she set a poem by 16th-century Spanish poet Saint John of the Cross to music.",
      "While embracing Catholic symbols and expressing a fascination with female saints, Rosal\u00eda seems to eschew strictly organized practice and draws inspiration from other religions, as well. \u201cLux\u201d responds to that diversity of interest, at one point quoting a Sufi poetess.",

      "Among the songs about faith, Rosal\u00eda found the time to deliver tunes like \u201cLa Perla\" (\"The Pearl\" in Spanish) that dishes out scorn for a former lover.",

      "\u201cLux\u201d can be intimidating for listeners, both due to its elaborate orchestration and smattering of esoteric lyrics that Rosal\u00eda was inspired to write after reading medieval mystical poets and their accounts of undergoing a transformative union with God through deep prayer and meditation.",
      "In the exhilarating \u201cReliquia\u201d (\u201cRelic\u201d in Spanish), Rosal\u00eda compares herself to female saints, listing the parts of her body and life she has left in cities around the world as relics for others\u2019 keeping. Her \u201cMio Cristo Piange Diamanti,\u201d (\"My Christ Weeps Diamonds\" in Italian), brims with the extravagant Baroque image of the jewels dripping from the eyes of the Messiah.",
      "In \u201cDivinize,\u201d Rosal\u00eda sings of the \u201cdivina buidor\u201d (\u201cdivine emptiness\u201d in Catalan), a central concept of medieval mysticism which focused on how the soul must experience abandonment to open a space where God can enter.",
      "Victoria Cirlot, professor of humanities at Barcelona\u2019s Pompeu Fabra University and expert in medieval feminine mystical tradition, liked \u201cLux\u201d for its ability to introduce complex religious concepts to the general public, while noting it is \u201ca minimalist\u201d sample of the mystical tradition.",
      "Cirlot said the moving \u201cLa Yugular\u201d (\u201cThe Jugular\u201d in Spanish) is rich in mystical thought because the throat, the home of the voice and the breath, is associated in many religious traditions as the body\u2019s door to the divine.",
      "But, for Cirlot, it\u2019s the entire package that makes \u201cLux\u201d so impactful.",
      "\u201cRosal\u00eda is not just a great singer; she is a great actress, and her body language is full of these mystical gestures like contorting her face in an expression of ecstasy, of staring into nothing,\u201d Cirlot said. \u201cAnd then we have her amazing voice, which creates a sense of flight.\u201d",

      "The White House is circulating a proposal to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for two more years",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House is circulating a proposal that would extend subsidies to help consumers pay for coverage under the Affordable Care Act for two more years, as millions of Americans face spiking health care costs when the current tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "The draft plan suggests that President Donald Trump is open to extending a provision of Obamacare as his administration and congressional Republicans search for a broader policy solution to a fight that has long flummoxed the party. The White House stresses that no plan is final until Trump announces it.",
      "The subsidies were at the heart of the Democrats\u2019 demands in the government shutdown fight that ended earlier this month. Most Democratic lawmakers had insisted on a straight extension of the tax credits, which expire at the end of the year as a condition of keeping the government open.",
      "Eligibility for the Obamacare subsidies, which were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people afford health care coverage, would be capped at 700% of the federal poverty level, according to two people with knowledge of the proposal. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a White House proposal that is in draft form.",
      "The baseline tax credits that were originally part of the Affordable Care Act were capped at 400% of the federal poverty level, but that cut-off was suspended because of the temporary COVID-era credits that allowed middle- and higher-income people to benefit from subsidies too.",
      "The White House would also require those on Obamacare, regardless of the type of coverage, to pay some sort of premium for their Obamacare plans. That would effectively end zero-premium plans for those with lower incomes, addressing a concern from Republicans that the program has enabled fraud. One option is a requirement that everyone pay 2% of their income, or at least $5 per month, for lower-tier plans.",
      "Even as the White House\u2019s proposal remains in flux, the notion of extending any part of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement is likely to rankle conservatives who have sought to repeal and replace the law for well over a decade.",
      "\u201cUntil President Trump makes an announcement himself, any reporting about the administration\u2019s health care positions is mere speculation,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday afternoon that Trump \u201cis very much involved in these talks\u201d and that he is \u201cfocused on unveiling a health care proposal that will fix the system and will bring down costs for consumers.\u201d",
      "But there are signs that parts of the nascent White House plan could get buy-in from Democrats. New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, one of eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus who voted to reopen the government earlier this month, said it \u201crepresents a starting point for serious negotiations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that President Trump is putting forward any offer at all to extend the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax credits shows that there is a broad understanding that inaction in this regard will cause serious harm to the American people,\u201d Hassan said.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve had constructive conversations with many of my Republican colleagues who I believe want to get this done,\u201d Shaheen said. \u201cThey understand that the vast majority of people who benefit from these tax credits live in states the President won, and that the President\u2019s own pollsters have underscored the enormous political urgency of Republicans acting.\u201d",
      "In 2017, Trump fell short in a push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, an embarrassing defeat for Republicans who had just seized control of all levers of power in Washington. The GOP has failed to coalesce around a unified health care proposal since, and the expiration of the pandemic-era subsidies gives Trump and his party an opportunity to put their own stamp on the issue.",
      "As the White House worked quietly on its plan, led by the Domestic Policy Council, key lawmakers on Capitol Hill have drafted their own proposals. For instance, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and others have proposed various ideas for redirecting the program\u2019s spending on federal subsidies into health savings accounts that enrollees could use to shop for plans or defray out-of-pocket costs. Scott's plan has been discussed with the White House multiple times since it was released Thursday, according to a person familiar not authorized to discuss the private conversations.",
      "The draft of the White House plan would allow those in lower-tier plans, such as the bronze-level or catastrophic plans, to put money into health savings accounts.",
      "It would also codify the \u201cprogram integrity rule\u201d to further help root out fraud, waste and abuse.",
      "Americans shopping for Obamacare coverage have already faced the sticker shock of price hikes, because the window for selecting next year\u2019s coverage began Nov. 1. Without congressional action, the average subsidized enrollee will face more than double their current cost in premiums next year, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",

      "With a runway of smoking-hot coals laid out before them, residents in San Pedro Manrique, Spain, steel themselves as thousands of onlookers cheer them on. The crowd roars when they walk across the fire, sometimes carrying another person on their back.",
      "Although the walkers and the crowd perform very different roles during the annual June ritual, they report similar feelings: an ineffable feeling of togetherness, as if the entire group becomes one, said Dimitris Xygalatas, a cognitive anthropologist at the University of Connecticut, who witnessed the Spanish ritual years ago as a researcher.",
      "He has experienced similar feelings in a stadium while chanting and cheering together with 30,000 fans of his hometown soccer team. Both are instances of collective effervescence, said Xygalatas, author of \u201cRituals: How Seemingly Senseless Acts Make Life Worth Living.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s that feeling that happens when people engage together in a meaningful activity that sparks positive emotions. Such as when you get goose bumps at a concert, feel the rush of adrenaline in group exercise classes or get swept up in religious festivals.",
      "Recently, collective effervescence has been referred to as \u201cwe mode,\u201d and it\u2019s something that can be cultivated to improve your life, said Kelly McGonigal, a Stanford University health psychologist.",
      "\u201cWhen you are connected through shared positive emotion, expressions often act as this aerosolized joy, where you catch other people\u2019s smiles, laughter, their physical expressions,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cIt becomes contagious.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe mode\u201d has also been called physiological synchrony, and McGonigal calls it \u201ccollective joy.\u201d The concept was documented more than a century ago by French sociologist Emile Durkheim, who described cultural effervescence after studying aboriginal Australian societies.",
      "Xygalatas\u2019 research has focused on measuring it in various group activities. To quantify \u201cautonomic responses,\u201d he has fitted people with heart monitors and electrodes and extracted thousands of stills from videos to analyze facial expressions.",
      "He found that people\u2019s physiological responses synchronize during exciting events. The heartbeats of sports fans who attend a game, for instance, sync up, while those of fans watching the same game on TV don\u2019t. Fans at the game also have higher levels of endorphins, which have been linked to bonding, he said.",
      "On a basic level, collective rituals involve meeting and connecting with people, which is a key to psychological well-being, Xygalatas noted.",
      "\u201cIf we all dress alike and we move alike and we feel alike, we express the same emotions that trigger mechanisms in our brain,\u201d Xygalatas said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental need for synchrony.\u201d",

      "Experts have mixed reactions to the recent U.N. climate talks in the Amazon",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- After an agreement from U.N. climate talks in the Amazon that fell short of many nations' expectations, experts found some bright spots alongside weighty reasons for worry in the fight against global warming.",
      "The Associated Press asked 17 experts \u2014 diplomats, analysts, advocates and scientists \u2014 the simple question: After the talks, known as COP30, in the city of Belem, what's next?",
      "\u201cWe leave here with a clear signal, very very clear signal, that we have entered the era of implementation,\" said U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell. \"As we move forward, it\u2019s about doing. It's about rolling sleeves up.\u201d",
      "Others look at the key failure of not delivering a road map to phase out coal, oil and gas \u2014 the main causes of warming. The road map had the public support of Brazil's president and more than 80 nations, but powerful opponents.",
      "\u201cThis should have been the moment. A COP in the Amazon, a president calling for a fossil fuel transition road map, the science screaming for action. But the world blinked again,'' Panama climate negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey G\u00f3mez said. \u201dThe next year will be harder on communities and ecosystems. Impacts will intensify, because emissions are not slowing down.\"",
      "Stiell pointed to seven different paragraphs in the agreements from Belem that could spur action for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and fewer fossil fuels. The COP presidency highlighted 117 \u201caction agenda\u201d items mostly for business to put pledges into real-life action.",
      "That agenda includes a promise of $1 trillion for improving energy grids and infrastructure; ramping up the production of biofuels; industrial decarbonization plans in developing countries; $5.5 billion toward a fund to pay countries to keep their forests standing; and other pledges of funding, including from the private sector, for projects in areas like farming and adaptation. Among the most ambitious actions is a push to raise $1 trillion for renewable electrical grids and energy storage.",
      "One specific action that Stiell and several others emphasized was a new \u201cglobal implementation accelerator,\" a voluntary and cooperative system designed to help nations that want to do more than they've previously proposed in their climate fighting plans. The emphasis is on getting money to where it's needed.",
      "\u201cIf the \u2018ambition accelerator\u2019 can help to do this, it will make a massive difference to the global warming outlook,\u201d said Bill Hare, CEO of the climate science and policy institute Climate Analytics.",
      "Because they couldn't get a consensus at the talks in Belem, the COP30 presidency promised to create two new \u201croad maps,\" one to guide the transition away from fossil fuels and another to stop deforestation. But those road maps won't have the force of something agreed upon in UN talks.",
      "COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago said his office will study both areas extensively and use science and economics to come up with those plans. He said they would be tailored to different countries' needs.",
      "Do Lago also promised that his office will join with Colombia and the Netherlands to organize a special fossil fuel phaseout conference scheduled next April.",
      "\u201cIf they come with real timelines, accountability and finance, they have the potential to shape global action and hold governments to their word,\u201d said Mariana Paoli of the anti-poverty group Christian Aid. \u201cThey don\u2019t have power on their own, but they can create the structure around which real change is built.\u201d",

      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is fending off criticism from his own base as some of the environmental and anti-vaccine activists who propelled him into politics have said they want stronger action against vaccines and pharmaceutical companies",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent a recent Wednesday showered in praise from the vice president and health technology CEOs at a glitzy \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d event in Washington, designed to celebrate the health secretary\u2019s successes and the movement he has built.",
      "Yet online, a different narrative of his tenure was playing out as a small but vocal group of Kennedy\u2019s supporters and former employees assailed top Trump administration advisers, claiming they were sabotaging him and redirecting MAHA away from its original goals.",
      "\u201cMAHA is not MAHA anymore,\u201d Gray Delany, a former Department of Health and Human Services official ousted in August, said in a podcast interview that day. \u201cI\u2019m not there, but what I\u2019ve heard of what\u2019s happening today is not the MAHA that we signed up for.\u201d",
      "The criticisms, which grew loud enough that the health secretary took to social media to defend his colleagues two days later, exposed the cracks that are beginning to form within his coalition as it amasses power and broadens in scope.",
      "Several of the environmental advocates and vaccine skeptics who helped propel Kennedy into politics have become impatient with what they view as inadequate action on their priorities. They\u2019re also wary that the Health Department appears willing to collaborate with pharmaceutical companies, tech firms and other big corporations whose motives they don\u2019t trust.",
      "The fissures pose a threat to the cohesion of a movement that has given President Donald Trump an important ally and Republicans access to a new group of voters. They come as cracks have developed in Trump's own Make America Great Again movement over issues like the Epstein files and the White House's focus on global diplomacy.",
      "In the wider public, MAHA has enjoyed soaring popularity. About two-thirds of Americans said they supported the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative from the federal government, according to an Ipsos poll from June.",
      "\u201cMAHA\u2019s growth is a sign of its success,\u201d said HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon. \u201cSecretary Kennedy is leading a broad coalition to make Americans healthier, guided by transparency, accountability and measurable results. The movement\u2019s meaning hasn\u2019t changed and it\u2019s stronger than ever.\u201d",
      "Public health researchers say the genius that fuels Kennedy\u2019s movement \u2014 the universal appeal of making Americans healthier \u2014 can also cause conflicts by inviting competing interests.",
      "\u201cThis is a tale as old as time in politics,\u201d said Matt Motta, a professor at Boston University School of Public Health. \u201cThe bigger your tent is, the harder it can be to make everyone happy.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, a longtime environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist who helped lead the crusade against COVID-19 shots during the pandemic, has taken many steps to curtail vaccines this year. He pulled $500 million for their development, ousted and replaced every member of a federal vaccine advisory committee and pledged to overhaul a federal program for compensating Americans injured by shots. He also has repeatedly spread false and misleading information about vaccines while in office.",
      "As recently as this week, in a move that thrilled Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its website to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "But many of Kennedy's supporters in what they call the \u201chealth freedom\u201d movement say it\u2019s not enough. Some want punishments for companies that profited from vaccine and mask requirements during the pandemic. Others want mRNA-based COVID-19 shots pulled from the shelves, despite scientific consensus that they have saved millions of lives.",
      "In their attacks on the administration last week, a few MAHA influencers and two fired HHS employees suggested White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Kennedy\u2019s close adviser, Stefanie Spear, were conspiring to limit Kennedy\u2019s ability to restrict vaccines and crack down on pharmaceutical companies.",
      "Some Kennedy supporters latched on to the claims and pointed to Wiles\u2019 career history at a lobbying firm that has worked with Pfizer as evidence she\u2019s trying to undermine him. They also shared years-old social media posts from Spear criticizing Trump.",
      "Kennedy defended his colleagues in two posts on X, saying the MAHA movement has \u201cno better friend in Washington\u201d than Wiles and that Spear has become a Trump loyalist.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s focus on our extraordinary achievements to date and the monumental work that still needs to be done,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s build our coalition instead of splintering it.\u201d",
      "Since the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d slogan debuted on the campaign trail last year, Kennedy and Trump have widened the MAHA tent considerably by inviting anyone into the fold who has concerns about Americans\u2019 health, nutrition and chronic disease.",

Kennedy, at an appearance with western governors Thursday, said he doesn't intend to take away people's access to vaccines.",

      "Indonesia has remained largely polio-free as the highly contagious disease was declared eliminated in the country in 2014. But eight years later, an outbreak emerged in the country's conservative Aceh province, prompted by a dangerous combination of consistently low routine immunization and unhealthy environmental conditions. In 2021, only 50.9% of infants born in Aceh received polio vaccination.",
      "Officials say that polio immunization rates in Aceh are well behind the rest of the country, with efforts hampered by widespread disinformation that the vaccine is incompatible with religious beliefs, among other things. The government has also been prioritizing COVID-19 vaccinations since they became available.",
      "Over the next two years, cases appeared in the provinces of Banten, West Java, Central Java, East Java, North Maluku, Central Papua, Highland Papua and South Papua, prompting the mass immunization and information drive.

      "The message is hammered over and over, in news conferences, hearings and executive orders: President Donald Trump and his health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., say they want the government to follow \u201cgold standard\u201d science.",
      "Scientists say the problem is that they are often doing just the opposite by relying on preliminary studies, fringe science or just hunches to make claims, cast doubt on proven treatments or even set policy.",
      "This week, the nation's top public health agency changed its website to contradict the scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. The move shocked health experts nationwide.",
      "Dr. Daniel Jernigan, who resigned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August, told reporters Wednesday that Kennedy seems to be \u201cgoing from evidence-based decision making to decision-based evidence making.\u201d",
      "It was the latest example of the Trump administration's challenge to established science.",
      "In September, the Republican president gave out medical advice based on weak or no evidence. Speaking directly to pregnant women and to parents, he told them not to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. He repeatedly made the fraudulent and long-disproven link between autism and vaccines, saying his assessment was based on a hunch.",

      "At a two-day meeting this fall, Kennedy\u2019s handpicked vaccine advisers to the CDC raised questions about vaccinating babies against hepatitis B, an inoculation long shown to reduce disease and death drastically.",
      "\u201cThe discussion that has been brought up regarding safety is not based on evidence other than case reports and anecdotes,\u201d said Dr. Flor Munoz, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital.",
      "During the country's worst year for measles in more than three decades, Kennedy cast doubt on the measles vaccine while championing unproven treatments and alleging that the unvaccinated children who died were \u201calready sick.\u201d",
      "Scientists say the process of getting medicines and vaccines to market and recommended in the United States has, until now, typically relied on gold standard science. The process is so rigorous and transparent that much of the rest of the world follows the lead of American regulators, giving the OK to treatments only after U.S. approval.",
      "The gold standard can differ because science and medicine is complicated and everything cannot be tested the same way. That term simply refers to the best possible evidence that can be gathered.",
      "\u201cIt completely depends on what question you\u2019re trying to answer,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease physician and Stanford University researcher.",
      "There are many different types of studies. The most rigorous is the randomized clinical trial.",
      "It randomly creates two groups of subjects that are identical in every way except for the drug, treatment or other question being tested. Many are \u201cblinded studies,\u201d meaning neither the subjects nor the researchers know who is in which group. This helps eliminate bias.",
      "It is not always possible or ethical to conduct these tests. This is sometimes the case with vaccine trials, \u201cbecause we have so much data showing how safe and effective they are, it would be unethical to withhold vaccines from a particular group,\u201d said Jessica Steier, a public health scientist and founder of the Unbiased Science podcast.",
      "Studying the long-term effect of a behavior can be impossible. For example, scientists could not possibly study the long-term benefit of exercise by having one group not exercise for years.",
      "Instead, researchers must conduct observational studies, where they follow participants and track their health and behavior without manipulating any variables. Such studies helped scientists discover that fluoride reduces cavities, and later lab studies showed how fluoride strengthens tooth enamel.",
      "But the studies have limitations because they can often only prove correlation, not causation. For example, some observational studies have raised the possibility of a link between autism risk and using acetaminophen during pregnancy, but more have not found a connection. The big problem is that those kinds of studies cannot determine if the painkiller really made any difference or if it was the fever or other health problem that prompted the need for the pill.",
      "Scientists can learn even more when they see how something affects a large number of people in their daily lives.",
      "That real-world evidence can be valuable to prove how well something works \u2014 and when there are rare side effects that could never be detected in trials.",
      "Such evidence on vaccines has proved useful in both ways. Scientists now know there can be rare side effects with some vaccines and can alert doctors to be on the lookout. The data has proved that vaccines provide extraordinary protection from disease. For example, measles was eliminated in the U.S. but it still pops up among unvaccinated groups.",

Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",

      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. flu season is starting slowly, and it's unclear if it will be as bad as last winter's, but some health experts are worried as U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data posted Friday shows a new version of the virus has emerged.",
      "An early analysis suggests current vaccines may still be somewhat effective against the new version of the flu, which has been the main driver of recent infections, CDC data shows.",
      "Some scientists and medical professionals are more worried about disappointing vaccination rates, a main reason why flu hospitalizations and deaths were unusually bad during last year's flu season \u2014 one of the deadliest this century.",

      "Last winter, the overall flu hospitalization rate was the highest seen since the H1N1 flu pandemic 15 years ago. Flu was the underlying or a contributing cause of more than 18,000 deaths, and one seven-day stretch early this year saw more than 1,800 deaths \u2014 the highest one-week spike in at least a decade. Child flu deaths also were far higher than usual.",
      "CDC data posted Friday showed low flu activity so far, with only one state \u2014 Louisiana \u2014 reporting moderate activity. Most of the reported infections have been in children, said the CDC's Alicia Budd, who tracks flu infections for the Atlanta-based agency.",
      "Most also have been a new version of the type A H3N2 virus that historically has caused the most hospitalizations and deaths in older people. That type is responsible for most flu infections so far this year, and more than half have been a new subclade K variant that is different from the strain this year's flu shots were built to fight.",
      "A preliminary analysis from the United Kingdom suggests the shots do provide at least partial protection, although it will take some time for scientists to know exactly how effective they are. Experts say any protection that softens the blow of a flu infection is important to get.",

Kennedy Jr. was put in charge of the CDC and other federal health agencies. Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist, has fostered uncertainty about the safety of vaccines, including flu shots that contained a preservative called thimerosal.",
      "Indeed, vaccination rates against COVID-19 clearly continue to plummet, with about 6% of children and 14% of adults up to date on their shots, according to other CDC data posted Friday. Each figure is about 3 percentage points less than it was at this point last fall.",
      "For the flu, vaccination trends are a little muddier. Some sources have suggested flu vaccinations are down. Over two million fewer flu shots were given at U.S. pharmacies through the end of October compared to last year, according to data from IQVIA, a health information and research company.",
      "But the latest CDC data indicates that for children, the vaccination rate this year is about the same as it was at this point last fall, at 34%. And the vaccination rate for adults is up a few percentage points to about 37%, according to the CDC data, which relies on survey information.",
      "It is early in the season and too early to know if the increase will be sustained or what is causing it, CDC officials said.",
      "As of the beginning of November, the U.S. flu hospitalization rate is about the same as it was at the same point in 2024. Hospitalization rates for COVID-19 and another respiratory virus, RSV, are lower so far this season, according to another set of CDC data.",

      "Dmitriev\u2019s lack of formal diplomatic credentials may work in his favor, said Boris Bondarev, a former Russian diplomat who quit in protest after Russia's 2022 invasion.

      "In 2011, when the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) was created, Dmitriev was appointed CEO. As head of the sovereign wealth fund, he represented the country on the global stage, working closely with a number of large Western firms as he sought to attract foreign investment to Russia.",
      "He became known as a savvy negotiator with a more modern touch than the older, Soviet-trained diplomats at the top levels of Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said political analyst Anton Barbashin.",

      "Ukraine's gas facilities have suffered severe damage from Russian drone and missile attacks, forcing the country to import more gas",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The soil surrounding the gas facility in Ukraine was once pitch-black before it was burned to a rusty red by a massive Russian drone and missile assault.",
      "Scattered remnants of Shahed drones littered the reservoir designated for storing tanks of liquefied propane gas. Nearly a month after the Oct. 30 attack, several tanks lay empty and in ruins.",
      "\u201cIt hurts to look at all this (damage) because I saw firsthand (the facility\u2019s) establishment, construction and development,\u201d said Victor, who has worked there for 28 years and who cannot be named in full for security reasons. \u201cBut we have, what we have and we must continue to work.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press gained exclusive access to Naftogaz\u2019s gas extraction fields in central Ukraine last week. The AP is the first and only news outlet to be allowed to film and photograph war damage at the facilities. Due to strict security protocols, the AP cannot name the facility or its exact location.",
      "Russia has targeted Ukrainian gas extraction this year in a bid to hurt morale and force Ukraine to import large quantities of gas at market prices which it can ill afford. Without the attacks, Ukraine would be able to cover the overwhelming majority of its consumption using its domestic extraction.",
      "Two devastating attacks on Ukraine\u2019s gas extraction facilities in March and October mean the country must import an additional 4.4 billion cubic meters this winter.",
      "To fill the gap, the Ukrainian state gas company, Naftogaz, said it is negotiating with U.S. government lenders to secure financing to buy American liquefied natural gas.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s energy crisis has played into the negotiations for a peace deal over the past week, a senior Ukrainian official told AP on condition of anonymity because they\u2019re not authorized to speak to the media.",
      "\u201cIt is urgent because of Ukraine\u2019s energy situation, urgent because of what Ukrainians need this winter, urgent in terms of the fight,\u201d the official said. The attacks on the country\u2019s electricity and gas infrastructure are imposing heavy costs on Ukraine and its economy a scenario that could repeat next year if the war continues.",
      "Gas is vital for Ukrainians to heat their homes in winters that can reach -20 Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit), as well as for centralized hot water systems. It is also essential for Ukraine's industry and, in some cases, it's used to generate electricity.",
      "\u201cGiven that gas infrastructure has no relation to military needs, the destruction of gas extraction, gas storage, gas transportation has only one aim: manic terror attacks so that Ukrainians are left without gas, heating and electricity\u201d said Serhii Koretskyi, Naftogaz\u2019s CEO, in an interview in Kyiv on Friday.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s domestic extraction facilities produce roughly 21 billion cubic meters of gas per year, according to the last published data from its energy regulator in 2023, before Russia began to attack gas infrastructure in earnest. Without attacks, it would still then need import 2 to 3 billion cubic meters a year, said Koretskyi.",
      "But the second major attack in late October devastated extraction capabilities, meaning Ukraine needs to import an additional 4.4 billion cubic meters, at a cost of roughly $2 billion, said Koretskyi, noting that some parts of the extraction system had been successfully repaired.",
      "Naftogaz has secured 70% of the money needed for the 4.4 billion cubic meters, mostly through European loans and a few grants, said Koretskyi. He said they are trying to obtain the remaining 30% through a loan from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and EXIM, another US government lender.",
      "But Naftogaz has not previously borrowed from the U.S. and time is of the essence. \u201cThis money was needed the day before yesterday. It takes time to buy it, bring it, deliver it, pump it, release it,\u201d said Koretskyi.",
      "Naftogaz is currently importing 25-30 million cubic meters per day, learning from the experience of previous years to avoid spiking prices for Ukraine and inside Europe with big, sudden purchases, Koretskyi said.",

      "Naftogaz\u2019s borrowing for this winter has been unavoidable because of the attacks on gas infrastructure, said Koretskyi. But with no end to Russian attacks in sight, some Ukrainian gas experts say the government must raise gas prices so that Naftogaz \u2013 and in turn the Ukrainian state \u2013 doesn\u2019t have to rely on raising large loans year-on-year.",
      "But this carries the risk of stirring up anger at a time when Ukraine's government is already under pressure from a major corruption scandal in the energy sector.",

      "Ukraine took several steps to bring its gas market in line with European Union requirements after it signed an EU association agreement in 2014. But Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022 halted its effort on the most crucial element: sustained market prices for households.",
      "At present, the state covers around 50% of the real market price, according to the country\u2019s memorandum with the International Monetary Fund published in July. This means Naftogaz is not making any money from gas sold to household consumers.",

      "Former Naftogaz CEO Yurii Vitrenko, a gas expert, estimates at least 30% of the population can afford to pay market prices for gas, electricity and heating, while the rest can apply for support. Vitrenko added that if the government gave payments direct to consumers, it could motivate people to use less gas in order to keep more of the money.",
      "\u201cIt would result in Ukraine having to import less gas,\u201d he said. However, he cautioned, \u201cIt should be done thoughtfully, being mindful of the need to maintain social cohesion\u201d.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A woman in New Zealand who was convicted of murdering her two children and leaving their bodies in suitcases for years before they were discovered will spend at least 17 years in prison, a judge ruled Wednesday.",
      "Justice Geoffrey Venning told Hakyung Lee at the High Court hearing in the city of Auckland that she would begin her sentence as a patient in a locked psychiatric facility, under New Zealand's compulsory mental health treatment law. Lee must return to prison when she is well enough, the judge said.",

      "However, the judge told Lee that while she was undoubtedly experiencing severe depression when she killed the children in 2018, her actions were deliberate and calculated, the news outlet Stuff reported. In New Zealand, a successful insanity defense requires a murder defendant to prove they were incapable of understanding what they were doing or that it was wrong.",
      "The children\u2019s remains were discovered after Lee stopped paying rental fees for an Auckland storage unit when she ran into financial difficulties in 2022. The locker\u2019s contents were auctioned online and the buyers found the bodies inside.",
      "Lee fled to South Korea after the killings, where she changed her name, before being extradited to face trial. She is a New Zealand citizen who was born in South Korea and went by the name Ji Eun Lee previously.",
      "During the trial, Lee's lawyers conceded that Lee had killed the children by giving them an antidepressant medication, but attorney Lorraine Smith said the deaths happened after her client \u201cdescended into madness,\" local news outlets reported. Lee had always been \u201cfragile,\u201d said Smith, but her mental illness became worse after her husband's death.",
      "Those convicted of murder in New Zealand automatically receive a life sentence, with judges setting a minimum period of at least 10 years before the defendant can apply for parole. Lee must serve at least 17 years, Justice Venning ruled.",

      "Authorities have seized an average of nine tigers each month over the past five years, highlighting a worsening trafficking crisis",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysa -- Authorities worldwide have seized an average of nine tigers each month over the past five years, highlighting a worsening trafficking crisis that threatens the survival of one of the planet\u2019s most iconic species, according to research released Tuesday.",
      "A new report by wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC warned that criminal networks are evolving faster than conservation efforts can respond. The global wild tiger population, once around 100,000 a century ago, has now plummeted to an estimated 3,700-5,500, it said.",
      "Despite half a century of international protection, TRAFFIC's findings showed that tiger trafficking is accelerating and increasingly targeting whole animals, living or dead. Experts say the shift appears linked to captive-breeding operations, but may also reflect tigers being seized shortly after poaching or before being dismembered for their parts. Additionally, it could be driven by a rise in exotic pet ownership or demand for taxidermy, they say.",
      "The report, the sixth in TRAFFIC\u2019s Skin and Bones series examining the illegal trade in tigers, highlights stark trends. Between 2000 and mid-2025, law enforcement agencies globally recorded 2,551 seizures involving at least 3,808 tigers.",
      "In the five years from 2020 to June 2025 alone, authorities made 765 seizures, confiscating the equivalent of 573 tigers, roughly nine a month over 66 months. The worst single year was 2019, when 141 seizures were recorded, followed by 139 in 2023.",
      "Most of the seizures occurred within the 13 countries which have wild tiger populations, led by India with the world's biggest tiger population, China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Among countries without tigers, a sizable number of incidents were reported by Mexico, U.S. and the United Kingdom, the report said. While enforecement has strengthened, so has trade.",
      "\u201cThis rise reflects improved enforcement efforts but also signals persistent and, in some areas, escalating criminal activity and a widespread demand for tigers and their parts,\u201d said Ramacandra Wong, senior wildlife crime analyst and co-author of the report.",
      "TRAFFIC\u2019s latest analysis reveals a dramatic shift: In the 2000s, tiger parts accounted for 90% of seized products but since 2020 that proportion has dropped to 60%, replaced by a spike in seizures of whole animal carcasses and live tigers. More than 40% of confiscations in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia now involve whole tigers.",

      "Patterns of consumption vary sharply by geography. In Mexico and the United States, demand trends toward live tigers, often for exotic pet ownership. Europe shows a stronger market for tiger derivatives used in certain traditional medicines and taxidermy for decoration. Across Asia, demand spans skins, bones, claws and whole dead animals for fashion and traditional medicine.",
      "The report said investigations should not end at the point of seizure. It said strong international cooperation is crucial, and that disruption of organized crime network along the illegal trade chain through intelligence-led, multi-agency enforcement is essential.",
      "Leigh Henry, director of wildlife conservation at the environmental charity WWF, told The Associated Press that the surge in whole-animal trafficking underscored the \u201cprominent role of captive tiger breeding facilities in feeding and perpetuating the illegal trade.\"",
      "\u201cIllegal trade remains the greatest immediate threat to wild tigers. If we don\u2019t urgently scale up investments to combat tiger trafficking \u2014 at all points along the trade chain \u2014 we absolutely face the possibility of a world without wild tigers,\u201d she said.",

A new U.S. push to end the fighting has set off the latest flurry of diplomacy, with American, European, Russian and Ukrainian officials all trying to shape the outcome of Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II.",

Ukraine and its allies offered a set of counterproposals that revamped the plan's points. Ukrainian and European leaders expressed optimism about the talks' momentum, but awaited responses from Washington and Moscow that are crucial.",

      "Britain\u2019s Labour Party government is set to deliver a high-stakes budget aimed at fixing public finances and boosting economic growth",
      "LONDON -- After being elected in a landslide last year, Britain\u2019s Labour Party government delivered a budget it billed as a one-off dose of tax hikes to fix the public finances, get debt down, ease the cost of living and spur economic growth.",
      "A year on, inflation remains stubbornly high, government borrowing is up and the economy is turgid. The annual budget, due on Wednesday, is expected to bring more tax hikes in pursuit of the same elusive economic boom.",
      "Rain Newton-Smith, head of business group the Confederation of British Industry, said Monday that \u201cit feels less like we\u2019re on the move, and more like we\u2019re stuck in \u2018Groundhog Day.\u2019\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just businesses who are concerned. Alarmed by the government\u2019s consistently dire poll ratings, some Labour lawmakers are mulling the once-unthinkable idea of ousting Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who led them to victory less than 18 months ago.",
      "Luke Tryl, director of pollster More in Common, said voters \"don\u2019t understand why there has not been positive change.",
      "\u201cThis could be a last-chance saloon moment for the government.\"",
      "The government says Treasury chief Rachel Reeves will make \u201ctough but right decisions\u201d in her budget to ease the cost of living, safeguard public services and keep debt under control.",
      "She has limited room for maneuver. Britain's economy, the world's sixth-largest, has underperformed its long-run average since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, and the center-left Labour government elected in July 2024 has struggled to deliver promised economic growth.",
      "Like other Western economies, Britain\u2019s public finances have been squeezed by the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs. The U.K. bears the extra burden of Brexit, which has knocked billions off the economy since the country left the European Union in 2020.",
      "The government currently spends more than 100 billion pounds ($130 billion) a year servicing the U.K.\u2019s debt, which stands at around 95% of annual national income.",
      "Adding to pressure is the fact that Labour governments historically have had to work harder than Conservative administrations to convince businesses and the financial markets that they are economically sound.",
      "Reeves is mindful of how financial markets can react when the government\u2019s numbers don\u2019t add up. The short-lived premiership of Liz Truss ended in October 2022 after her package of unfunded tax cuts roiled financial markets, drove down the value of the pound and sent borrowing costs soaring.",
      "Luke Hickmore, an investment director at Aberdeen Investments, said the bond market is the \u201cultimate reality check\u201d for budget policy.",
      "\u201cIf investors lose faith, the cost of borrowing rises sharply, and political leaders have little choice but to change course,\u201d he said.",
      "The government has ruled out public spending cuts of the kind seen during 14 years of Conservative government, and its attempts to cut Britain\u2019s huge welfare bill have been stymied by Labour lawmakers.",
      "That leaves tax increases as the government\u2019s main revenue-raising option.",

      "Instead of an economy that has \u201csparked into life,\u201d enabling higher spending and lower taxes, Rutter said Reeves must decide whether \u201cto fill a big fiscal black hole with tax increases or spending cuts.\u201d",
      "The budget comes after weeks of messy mixed messaging that saw Reeves signal she would raise income tax rates \u2013 breaking a key election promise \u2013 before hastily reversing course.",
      "In a Nov. 4 speech, Reeves laid the groundwork for income tax hikes by arguing that the economy is sicker and the global outlook worse than the government knew when it took office.",
      "After an outcry among Labour lawmakers, and a better-than-expected update on the public finances, the government signaled it preferred a smorgasbord of smaller revenue-raising measures such as a \u201cmansion tax\u201d on expensive homes and a pay-per-mile tax for electric vehicle drivers.",
      "The government will try to ease the sting with sweeteners including an above-inflation boost to pension payments for millions of retirees and a freeze on train fares.",
      "Critics say more taxes on employees and businesses, following tax hikes on businesses in last year\u2019s budget, will push the economy further into a low-growth doom loop.",
      "Patrick Diamond, professor in public policy at Queen Mary University of London, said satisfying both markets and voters is difficult.",
      "\u201cYou can give markets confidence, but that probably means raising taxes, which is very unpopular with voters,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, you can give voters confidence by trying to minimize the impact of tax rises, but that makes markets nervous because they feel that the government doesn\u2019t have a clear fiscal plan.\u201d",
      "The budget comes as Starmer is facing mounting concern from Labour lawmakers over his dire poll ratings. Opinion polls consistently put Labour well behind the hard-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister\u2019s office sparked a flurry of speculation earlier this month by preemptively telling news outlets that Starmer would fight any challenge to his leadership. What looked like an attempt to strengthen Starmer\u2019s authority backfired. The reports set off jitters verging on panic among Labour lawmakers, who fear the party is heading for a big defeat at the next election.",
      "That election does not have to be held until 2029, and the government continues to hope that its economic measures will spur higher growth and ease financial pressures.",
      "But analysts say a misfiring budget could be another nail in the coffin of Starmer\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cBoth Starmer and Reeves are really unpopular,\u201d Rutter said. \u201cThey may be hanging on for now, but I don\u2019t think people will be giving you great odds that they\u2019ll necessarily last the course of the Parliament,\u201d which runs until the next election.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. stock market is climbing again Tuesday on hopes for a coming cut to interest rates.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 0.8% after breaking out of a morning lull, where it bobbed between small gains and losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 650 points, or 1.4%, with less than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.5% higher.",
      "Stocks got a boost from easing yields in the bond market. Lower interest rates can cover up many sins in financial markets, including prices going too high, and hopes are high that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting to juice the economy further.",
      "A raft of mixed economic data on Tuesday left traders betting on a nearly 85% probability that the Fed will cut in December, according to data from CME Group. That\u2019s roughly the same as a day before and up sharply from the coin flip\u2019s chance that traders saw just a week ago.",
      "One of Thursday's reports said that shoppers bought less at U.S. retailers  in September than economists expected. Another said confidence among U.S. consumers worsened  by more than expected, a second signal that the economy could potentially use the help of lower interest rates.",
      "Easier rates can boost the economy by encouraging households and companies to borrow more and investors to pay higher prices for investments than they would otherwise.",
      "A third report, meanwhile, said that inflation at the wholesale level was a touch worse in September than economists expected, but a closely tracked underlying trend was slightly better. That\u2019s important because lower interest rates can make inflation worse, and high inflation is the main deterrent that could keep the Fed from cutting rates.",
      "After taking all the data together, economists suggested the Fed and its chair, Jerome Powell, could be leaning toward cutting rates on Dec. 10. The Fed has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up a slowing job market.",
      "\u201cTaking a pause on rate cuts would probably do more damage to sentiment than a cut would help,\u201d according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, who also said \u201cPowell doesn\u2019t need to be the Grinch that stole Christmas.\u201d",
      "Easier interest rates can give particularly big boosts to smaller companies, because many of them need to borrow to grow. The Russell 2000 index of the smallest U.S. stocks jumped 2.1% to lead the market.",

      "LONDON -- Britain's Treasury chief Rachel Reeves left her offices at No. 11 Downing Street Wednesday to deliver a crucial tax-raising budget statement to lawmakers that she hopes will manage to please financial markets, businesses and jaded voters at the same time.",
      "Following weeks of speculation and mixed signals that unsettled the markets, Reeves held out her red ministerial briefcase to the awaiting media, as is custom and tradition.",
      "The budget, her second since Britain's center-left Labour government returned to power after 14 years with a landslide election victory in July 2024, could prove pivotal in the fortunes of both Reeves and her boss, Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Reeves is set to tell lawmakers that more tax-raising measures are necessary to plug a hole in the public finances. In a video statement before she headed to the House of Commons, Reeves said she would \u201ctake the fair and necessary choices\u201d to ease the cost of living, safeguard public services and keep debt under control.",
      "\u201cAnd I will push ahead with the biggest drive for growth in a generation,\" she said.",
      "Reeves, the first woman to hold the post of chancellor of the exchequer, said much the same at her first budget a little more than a year ago. She insisted at the time it would be the one and only big tax-raising budget in this parliamentary term, which is due to run to 2029.",
      "Unfortunately for Reeves, the British economy, the world's sixth-largest, is not doing as well as she hoped, with many critics blaming her decision last year to slap taxes on business. Though there were signs that the economy was on the mend in the first half the year, when it was the fastest-growing among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, it has faltered again.",
      "\u201cThe chancellor faces a delicate balancing act of conveying fiscal stability while advancing the growth agenda,\u201d said Peter Arnold, chief economist at consulting firm EY U.K.",
      "False dawns have been a regular feature of the British economy since the global financial crisis of 2008-9. If the economy had kept growing at precrisis levels, it would be nearly a quarter bigger than it is now. That's a lot of lost activity \u2014 and a lot of lost tax revenue going into the Treasury's coffers.",

The U.K. bears the extra burden of Brexit, which has knocked billions off the economy since the country left the European Union in 2020.",
      "Meanwhile, Reeves has a bunch of spending commitments aimed at easing the cost of living as inflation remains stubbornly high, including making up for a series of about-turns on planned welfare cuts and the likely ditching of a cap on benefits paid out to families with several children. That and measures such as freezing rail fares or cutting green taxes on energy bills don't come cheap.",
      "All in all, economists think that she will have to find something like 20-30 billion pounds ($26-39 billion). After flirting with the idea of hiking income tax rates, which would break a key Labour election promise, Reeves now looks likely to raise money from smaller, and more fiddly, taxes.",
      "The main measure anticipated is a further freeze in the levels at which earners pay Britain's different tax levels, meaning as wages rise more people fall into higher tax brackets. Other potential changes include a mansion tax on high-valued properties, changes to the capital tax regime and a cut to tax-free provisions for private pensions.",
      "The budget is a high-stakes moment for Reeves and Starmer, who is facing mounting concern from Labour lawmakers over his dire poll ratings. Opinion polls consistently put Labour well behind the hard-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage.",

      "Sales rose 0.2% in September from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, in a report delayed more than a month because of the government shutdown. Sales jumped 0.6% in July and August and 1% in June. Numerous reports on inflation, employment, spending, and growth remain delayed and the government won\u2019t likely be caught up until late December.",
      "The retail sales figures suggest that Americans pulled back a bit in September as many households are still struggling with high prices for groceries, rent, and many imported goods hit by tariffs. Still, the modest increase in spending may lift the economy\u2019s growth to a solid 3% or higher annual rate in the July-September quarter, economists forecast, after a sluggish 1.6% expansion in the first half of the year.",
      "At the same time, hiring has been weak and the unemployment rate has ticked higher, which could drag down consumer spendin g and the broader economy if it worsens. Unemployment rose to 4.4% in September, the highest in nearly four years, from 4.3%, according to the delayed monthly jobs report released last week.",
      "Higher-income consumers are driving much of the gains, according to data from Bank of America and reports from retailers such as Walmart, as l ower-income shoppers seek bargains and are more likely to spend more on necessities. .",
      "Tuesday\u2019s report comes before the crucial winter holiday season kicks off this weekend, when retailers earn as much as a fifth of their revenues. The National Retail Federation and other forecasters expect modest sales gains this year, compared with last year\u2019s holiday, with the NRF projecting that sales will top $1 trillion for the first time.",

      "Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest women",
      "NEW YORK -- MacKenzie Scott, one of the world's wealthiest women and most influential philanthropists, is now known for her \u201cno strings attached\u201d surprise grantmaking. But, as a Princeton University sophomore, she learned what it was like to be on the receiving end of generosity.",
      "Facing the prospect of dropping out if she couldn't come up with $1,000, Scott was crying when her roommate, Jeannie Tarkenton, found her and got her dad to loan Scott the money.",
      "\u201cI would have given MacKenzie my left kidney,\u201d Tarkenton told the Associated Press recently. \u201cLike, that\u2019s just what you do for friends.\u201d",
      "Today, Scott\u2019s net worth is around $34 billion, according to Forbes. In October, Scott wrote that Tarkenton's act is among the many personal kindnesses she has considered as she has donated more than $19 billion of the wealth she amassed mostly through Amazon shares as part of her 2019 divorce from company founder Jeff Bezos. And when Tarkenton started Funding U, a lending company that offers last-gap, merit-based loans to low-income students without co-signers, Scott said she jumped at the chance to help.",
      "A quarter century passed between the end of their sophomore year and Funding U's creation, a period when Tarkenton realized just how many more students were being pushed into her former roommate's position by the rising cost of college. That Scott took an interest in her old friend's mission to help economically disadvantaged students finance school is unsurprising. Her unusual gifts \u2014 which she rarely discusses or discloses outside of essays and a database on her website, Yield Giving \u2014 tend to focus on issues of equity, higher education and economic security.",
      "But the revelation of Scott's Funding U support offers a new glimpse into her investments. Scott wrote last year that she would invest in \u201cmission-aligned ventures\u201d led by \u201cundercapitalized groups\u201d that focus on \u201cfor-profit solutions\u201d to the challenges that her philanthropy seeks to address. However, this is among the few confirmed publicly.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s looking for innovative ways to create opportunity for those that don\u2019t have it,\" said Marybeth Gasman, who runs Rutgers\u2019 Center for Minority Serving Institutions and follows Scott\u2019s donations. \"I have to say, as somebody who went to school on a Pell Grant and who came from an extremely low-income family, that\u2019s really meaningful.\u201d",
      "Scott, in many ways, resembled the exact students that Funding U seeks to serve. Tarkenton recalled the undergraduate Scott as a \u201chardworking student with very good grades\u201d who was \u201chighly focused\" and had already been accepted into a competitive program.",
      "Her lending company plugs those sorts of details \u2014 student transcripts and internship experiences, for example\u2014 into an algorithm that determines the likelihood applicants will complete college, get a job and make enough money to pay back the loan.",
      "Tarkenton suggested that this formula is fairer \u2014 and more predictive \u2014 than existing criteria that determine loan eligibility based on the credit histories of students or their co-signers.",
      "Scott provides most of the \u201cjunior debt\u201d they use to reduce the risk for larger investments from banks such as Goldman Sachs, according to Tarkenton. She is among a handful of philanthropists who provide 30 cents for every dollar that Funding U loans. These funders lend at concessionary rates, meaning they make less money back than the market suggests they should and wait a longer period of time to recoup the money.",
      "Funding U gets the other 70% from banks, who support them to comply with federal laws aimed at preventing anti-poor discrimination by requiring banks to make loans that benefit their communities.",
      "\u201cI wanted to combine capital from people who were participating in this because they cared about the underlying person,\u201d Tarkenton said, \u201cand also, knowing that scale of philanthropy wasn\u2019t quite big enough, bring to the table some sort of market solution alongside that capital.\u201d",

      "President Rodrigo Paz of Bolivia says he will scrap a ream of taxes in one of his first moves since becoming the nation\u2019s first conservative leader in nearly two decades in a bid to rescue a crisis-stricken economy",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 President Rodrigo Paz of Bolivia said Tuesday he planned to scrap a ream of taxes, in one of his first moves since becoming the nation's first conservative leader in nearly two decades in a bid to rescue a crisis-stricken economy.",
      "Just over two weeks since taking office, Paz also announced his government would slash 30% of total federal spending from Bolivia's 2026 budget to reverse years of populist economic measures taken under the long-ruling Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party. He did not give further details on how his government would make such deep cuts.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Paz said he was proposing to repeal Bolivia\u2019s national wealth tax, arguing that it had crippled growth and discouraged billions of dollars in investments since being imposed by his left-wing predecessor, former President Luis Arce.",
      "Another levy on the chopping block is Bolivia's 0.3% tax on everyday financial transactions, Paz said, something that long motivated Bolivians to keep clear of the formal banking system and instead stash their savings under mattresses and floorboards.",
      "\u201cWe are giving the first signs of security that the country requires,\u201d Paz said. \u201cWe are paving the way for economic activity.\u201d",
      "The bills to remove the taxes must be sent to Congress for approval before taking effect. Business leaders were already thrilled.",
      "\u201cThe persecution of the private sector is ending,\" said Klaus Freking from the country's main agricultural chamber. \u201cIt is the beginning of legal certainty.\u201d",
      "But Paz and his Economy Minister Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Espinoza said Tuesday that, for now, their government wouldn't touch the pillars of Bolivia's economic model under the MAS party \u2014 specifically, the country's fuel subsidies that keep its retail price of gasoline among the world's cheapest, as well as its fixed exchange rate that became distorted as the country's central bank ran out of U.S. dollars.",
      "\u201cThe president is starting off on the right foot, aiming to generate better investments,\u201d said Bolivian economic analyst Gonzalo Ch\u00e1vez. \u201cBut he\u2019s not addressing the core problems.\u201d",
      "Paz is sticking to his campaign promise of deploying gradual measures \u2014 as opposed to a shock fiscal adjustment of the kind that Bolivians have known and feared since the 1990s \u2014 to dig Bolivia out of its worst financial crisis in four decades.",
      "While major challenges remain and doubts linger, there are already signs that the medicine is taking effect. The endemic lines that snaked from fuel pumps across the country due to a severe shortage of gasoline have largely disappeared as Paz works to secure imports.",

He said he expected the package in 60 to 90 days, without naming the multilateral lenders involved in the deal.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Tyson Foods' decision to close a beef plant that employs nearly one third of residents of Lexington, Nebraska, could devastate the small city and undermine the profits of ranchers nationwide.",
      "Closing a single slaughterhouse might not seem significant, but the Lexington plant employs roughly 3,200 people in the city of 11,000 and has the capacity to slaughter some 5,000 head of cattle a day. Tyson also plans to cut one of the two shifts at a plant in Amarillo, Texas, and eliminate 1,700 jobs there. Together those two moves will reduce beef processing capacity nationwide by 7-9%.",
      "Consumers may not see prices change much at the grocery store over the next six months because all the cattle that are now being prepared for slaughter will still be processed, potentially just at a different plant. But in the long run, beef prices may continue to climb even higher than the current record highs \u2014 caused by a variety of factors from drought to tariffs \u2014 unless American ranchers decide to raise more cattle, which they have little incentive to do.",
      "An increase in beef imports from Brazil, like President Donald Trump encouraged last week by slashing tariffs on the South American country, may help insulate consumers while ranchers and feedlots struggle with high costs and falling prices.",
      "Here's what we know about the impact of the plant closure and the changing tariffs:",
      "Clay Patton, vice president of the Lexington-area Chamber of Commerce said Monday that Tyson\u2019s announcement Friday felt like a \u201cgut punch\u201d to the community in the Platte River Valley that serves as a key link in the agricultural production chain.",
      "When it opened in 1990, the Lexington plant that Tyson later acquired revitalized and remade the formerly dwindling town by attracting thousands of immigrants to work there and nearly doubling the population.",
      "When the plant closes in January, the ripple effects will be felt throughout the community, undermining many first-generation business owners and the investment in new housing, Patton said. Tyson said it will offer Lexington workers the chance to move to take open jobs at one of its other plants if they are willing to uproot their families for jobs hundreds of miles away.",

      "The prospect of losing a major buyer for cattle and increasing imports from Brazil, which already accounted for 24% of the beef brought into the country this year, only adds to doubts about how profitable the U.S. cattle business might be over the next several years, making it less likely that American ranchers will commit to raising more animals.",

      "Boosting imports from Brazil has the potential to affect the market \u2014 much more than Trump's suggestion to increase imports from Argentina \u2014 since the country sends more beef to America than any other. But for steak lovers, the sky-high price of the cut isn\u2019t likely to be affected regardless, as most imports are lean trimmings that get mixed into ground beef.",
      "Kansas State University agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said it's hard to predict whether imports will continue to account for roughly 20% of the U.S. beef supply next year. He pointed out that Trump's tariffs have changed several times since they were announced in the spring and could quickly change again.",
      "The only constant in the equation has been that consumers have continued to buy beef even as prices soar. Tonsor said on average Americans will consume 59 pounds (27 kilograms) of beef per person this year.",
      "There has long been excess capacity in the meat business nationwide, meaning the nation\u2019s slaughterhouses could handle many more cattle than they are processing. That has only been made worse in recent years as the government has encouraged more smaller companies to open slaughterhouses to compete with Tyson and the other giants that dominate the beef business.",
      "Tyson expects to lose more than $600 million on beef production this year after already reporting $720 million of red ink in beef over the past two years.",

      "President Donald Trump says his plan to end the war in Ukraine has been \"fine-tuned.\"",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Tuesday his plan to end the war in Ukraine has been \u201cfine-tuned\u201d and he\u2019s sending envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to meet with Ukrainian officials.",
      "Trump suggested he could eventually meet with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but not until further progress has been made in negotiations. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday evening aboard Air Force One, Trump said resolving the war was difficult, and described what had been a 28-point plan as a work in progress. \u201cThat was not a plan \u2014 it was a concept,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump\u2019s plan for ending the nearly four-year war emerged last week. It heavily favored Russia, prompting Zelenskyy to quickly engage with American negotiators. European leaders, fearing for their own future facing Russian aggression but apparently sidelined by Trump in drawing up the proposal, scrambled to steer the negotiations toward accommodating their concerns.",
      "Trump said he believed Witkoff would be meeting with Putin next week in Moscow, with his son-in-law Jared Kushner potentially joining the meeting. \u201cPeople are starting to realize it\u2019s a good deal for both parties,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The president played down the element of his plan that would require Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, suggesting that Russian forces were already likely to seize the land they're seeking.",
      "\u201cThe way it\u2019s going, if you look, it\u2019s just moving in one direction,\" Trump said. \"So eventually that\u2019s land that over the next couple of months might be gotten by Russia anyway.\u201d",
      "At the center of Trump\u2019s plan is the call on Ukraine to concede the entirety of its eastern Donbas region, even though a vast swath of that land remains in Ukrainian control. Analysts at the independent Institute for the Study of War have estimated it would take several years for the Russian military to completely seize the territory, based on its current rate of advances.",
      "Trump made his comments after Driscoll held talks late Monday and throughout Tuesday with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, to discuss the emerging proposal.",
      "\u201cThe talks are going well and we remain optimistic,\u201d Lt. Col. Jeff Tolbert, spokesman for the Army secretary, said in a statement. Witkoff, a real estate developer turned diplomat, has been Trump\u2019s chief interlocutor with Putin, while Driscoll, who is close to Vance, has stepped up his involvement in the administration\u2019s peace push in recent days.",
      "As the talks were taking place, Russia launched a wave of overnight attacks on Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, with at least seven people killed in strikes that hit city buildings and energy infrastructure. A Ukrainian attack on southern Russia killed three people and damaged homes, authorities said.",
      "Trump spoke to reporters after Bloomberg News published a transcript of an Oct. 14 call between Witkoff and Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov where Witkoff coached his counterpart on how Putin should handle a call with Trump.",
      "Trump downplayed Witkoff\u2019s reported approach as \u201ca very standard form of negotiation.\u201d",
      "But U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican who has been critical of Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine, said the transcript showed Witkoff favors the Russians. \u201cHe cannot be trusted to lead these negotiations. Would a Russian paid agent do less than he? He should be fired,\u201d Bacon said on social media.",
      "Bloomberg said it reviewed a recording of the call, but did not say how it obtained access to the recording. The Associated Press has not independently verified the transcript.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday that peace efforts are gathering momentum and \u201care clearly at a crucial juncture.\u201d",

      "The decision comes just two weeks after his release from prison pending an appeal in another campaign financing case. Sarkozy, 70, was incarcerated for 20 days in Paris' La Sant\u00e9 prison, after judges convicted him of scheming to get secret financing from Libya in his winning campaign for the French presidency in 2007.

      "Decades-long efforts to provide uncensored foreign news into North Korea are facing setbacks now",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- For two hours every day, Lee Si-young and her colleagues broadcast uncensored foreign news into authoritarian North Korea. Her radio audience could go to jail if caught listening.",
      "Lee's Seoul-based Free North Korea Radio station has tried for two decades to give real-time news to North Korea's 26 million people. But Lee says she now feels a sense of crisis about her work as big government-funded broadcasters in the United States and South Korea have fallen silent this year because of major funding cuts and policy changes.",
      "\u201cOur frustrations with the U.S. and South Korean governments are growing over their suspensions of radio broadcasts,\" said Lee, a defector who heads the small, nongovernmental FNK radio station. \"We're afraid that they've abandoned North Korean residents.\u201d",
      "In North Korea, all radio and TV sets are fixed to state-run channels.",
      "But defectors have testified that they modified their radios or used smuggled ones to covertly tune in to foreign broadcasts at night for news their government didn't want them to hear. That includes outside perspectives of the North's ruling Kim dynasty, more affluent and freer Western lifestyles, and success stories about defectors.",
      "But a respected academic website focused on North Korea, 38 North, assessed last month that such outside radio broadcasting toward North Korea was down by 85% after cuts made by the U.S. and South Korean governments.",
      "Two major U.S.-funded broadcasters \u2014 the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia \u2014 were forced to stop their Korean-language radio broadcasts after U.S. President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order effectively dismantling the agency that oversaw or provided funding to media networks. Trump said the networks had a liberal bias or were wasteful.",
      "South Korea's liberal government led by President Lee Jae Myung halted cross-border radio broadcasts in an attempt to lower animosities with North Korea. His government also turned off frontline loudspeakers blaring K-pop songs and world news, and banned activists from flying balloons with propaganda leaflets and USB sticks across the border.",
      "The FNK station is now one of several small civil or religious organizations that still transmit radio broadcasts into North Korea. Lee, the FNK head, said that VOA and RFA were much bigger than her group, which has only five workers, all defectors from North Korea.",
      "\u201cWe feel heavy-hearted and have a conflict over whether we should tell North Koreans that those suspended broadcasts were paused only temporarily and they would definitely be restarted or that we're the only one of the few who survived,\u201d she said.",
      "Despite setbacks in efforts to spread outside news in North Korea, Lee Young-hyeon, a defector-turned-lawyer in South Korea, this month launched a website and a mobile app meant to provide North Koreans with an alternative way to get outside information.",
      "Lee said his Korea Internet Studio would first target tens of thousands of North Koreans living abroad, including laborers, students, diplomats and their family members. Many of these North Koreans abroad use mobile phones with access to the global internet, a privilege citizens in the North don't have.",

      "\u201cWe don't expect the public using our content to launch an uprising and topple the North Korean government,\u201d Lee said. The objective, he said, is for North Koreans to \"learn there is such a good world where they can enjoy some freedom and rights.\u201d",
      "Lee said he thinks North Korea will eventually ease its strict restrictions on the internet in a limited manner as it could allow Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and other foreign companies to open local offices in the North.",
      "Many observers are skeptical, though.",
      "Since 2020, North Korea has enacted highly oppressive laws to toughen its fight against foreign cultural influences, especially South Korea's. The Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Law reportedly imposes up to 10 years of imprisonment with hard labor on those who consume, possess or spread foreign movies and music, and up to five years on those who use unauthorized radio and TV channels.",
      "Some question whether campaigns to provide outside news to North Korea have made a difference. Launches of propaganda balloons and loudspeaker broadcasts have also been a major source of tension with North Korea.",
      "In July, South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young called radio and loudspeaker broadcasts \u201ca relic of the Cold War\" and expressed hope that their suspension would improve ties with North Korea. In response to questions posed by The Associated Press, the South Korean Defense Ministry said the suspension of its \u201cVoice of Freedom\u201d radio broadcast was designed to ease military tensions with North Korea.",
      "South Korean officials say North Korea has also switched off its own border loudspeakers and stopped transmitting jamming signals targeting South Korean radio broadcasts. But North Korea is still refusing to resume long-dormant talks with South Korea and the U.S.",
      "Before his defection in 2003, Paek Yosep said he was shocked when South Korean radio broadcasts reported about anti-government protests in Seoul, something that is unthinkable in North Korea. Paek said when he served as a soldier at a frontline unit, he enjoyed listening to music blared from South Korean loudspeakers across the border.",
      "Kim Ki-sung at the FNK station said that the South Korean radio broadcasts he listened to for a decade before he fled North Korea in 1999 influenced his defection. He said he learned that South Korea was rich enough to grant loans to the Soviet Union and that it had so many cars there were traffic jams.",
      "\u201cI'm not sure how strongly addictive drugs are but I think those broadcasts were the same,\u201d Kim said. \u201cMany ask us whether we've confirmed that people in North Korea are truly listening to our programs. But I believe we should keep doing this even if just one person listens to our broadcasts.\u201d",

      "Small businesses are struggling to adapt since the U.S. ended the \"de minimis\" exemption on Aug. 29, which allowed imports under $800 to be tariff-free",
      "NEW YORK -- At Fleece & Harmony, a woolen mill and yarn shop in bucolic Belfast, Prince Edward Island, in Canada, owner Kim Doherty used to be able to send yarn skeins to U.S. customers across the border with little fanfare.",
      "The yarn orders usually met an import tax exemption for packages valued at under $800, meaning it could be imported tariff-free and avoid the customs process.",
      "But ever since the Trump administration eliminated the exemption as of Aug. 29, the cost to send yarn to U.S. customers has skyrocketed. The bill for a $21 ball of yarn now includes $12 to $15 in brokerage fees that her shipper UPS charges, plus state taxes and a 6.5% tariff, all of which almost doubles her costs.",
      "\u201cWe had orders that have reached the customers and they\u2019re in shock about the fact that they have to pay,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s amazing how many people really didn\u2019t know what the impact was going to be.\u201d",
      "Getting rid of the so-called de minimis exemption was meant to curb drug trafficking and stop low-quality goods from discount sellers like Temu and Shein flooding the U.S. market.",
      "But as the all-important annual holiday shopping season kicks off, it is putting a crimp on small businesses and shoppers now facing higher costs.",
      "Chad Lundquist in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, ordered fragrance oil from a site called Oil Perfumery in October, but he didn't realize the business was based in Toronto, Canada. His total was $35.75, which included an $8 standard shipping fee. But when his package arrived, he was hit with a $10.80 tariff bill from FedEx.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t worth the $10 tariff for a $27 purchase,\u201d Lundquist said. Oil Perfumery did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "He's not the only skittish shopper. Three months after the exemption ended, sellers abroad are reporting drastic declines in U.S. sales. Some are paying the duties themselves instead of passing them to consumers. They are also trying to focus on domestic customers to replace U.S. ones and adjusting product lineups to feature best selling items to try to goose sales.",
      "Martha Keith, founder of British stationery brand Martha Brook, which is based in London with a small office in Melbourne, Australia, said U.S. sales from her Etsy store \u2014 her main e-commerce channel in addition to her own website \u2014 were up 50% for the year before the exemption ended. But sales fell dramatically when the tariffs hit, and continue to drop even though she\u2019s paying the import taxes and customs fees herself so customers aren't impacted. Sales are down about 30% year-over-year.",
      "\u201cThe issue seems to be in customer confidence hitting the desire to order from businesses outside of the U.S., because of confusion about how the tariffs will affect them,\u201d Keith said.",
      "She\u2019s also in a bind because she sold a \u00a3109 ($144) stationery advent calendar to about 200 U.S. customers ahead of the tariffs, and now she has to ship them. Shipping and tariffs will cost a combined \u00a325 ($33), meaning Keith will have to find an additional \u00a35,000 ($6,583) to cover shipping the advent calendars already sold.",
      "\u201cThe whole thing has been a bit of a nightmare for businesses like ours, and such a huge shame, as the U.S. market was such a valuable growth area for us, particularly through Etsy,\u201d she said.",
      "The timing was particularly bad for Sue Bacarro, who along with her sister co-owns Digi Wildflowers, an Etsy shop that sells embroidered baby blankets, gifts and custom quilts for wedding and anniversaries, located across the border from Detroit in Windsor, Ontario.",
      "Before the announcement of the removal of the de minimis exemption, they placed a large inventory order to prepare for the holiday season and early 2026 demand. But when the de minimis exemption ended, \u201cinventory wasn\u2019t moving as expected, and we suspected customers were hesitant to purchase due to potential duty charges,\u201d Bacarro said.",
      "Sales \u2014 70% of which come from Americans \u2014 finally started to rebound when Digi Wildflowers prominently added a banner on its site that said, \u201cU.S. Import Duties On Us.\u201d",

More than three-fourths of her customer base comes from the U.S. Australia Post suspended service to the U.S. for about a month, resuming on Sept. 22.",
      "She temporarily switched to FedEx and UPS \u2014 private shippers that are more expensive than Australia Post. Since it resumed, Australia Post is working with Zonos, a provider of cross-border shipping technology, to offer a shipping calculator that lets her prepay duties and fees. They themselves charge a fee of $1.69 plus 10% of the total duty fee.",
      "So far, the items she ships from Australia have been tariffed at a 10% rate, the baseline tariff for the country. She increased her shipping costs to help cover the expense. It is manageable, but tricky, she said.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really know how much (the cost) is going to be until the package clears custom in the U.S., and you get an invoice which is automatically paid out of your account,\u201d she said.",
      "And her sales have not recovered. Before the tariffs, her U.S. sales were about 85% of her total sales, and now they\u2019re around 35%. She\u2019s hopeful people are just holding off until Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday sales.",
      "In the meantime, she has restarted sales to Europe, which she had paused in 2024 due to increased regulations. And she's launched a Facebook marketing campaign and is exploring print-on-demand services from U.S.-based providers for production and fulfillment.",
      "\u201cThis situation highlights how fragile small businesses can be when dependent on one market,\u201d Pierangelini said. \u201cWhile it has been a shock, it\u2019s also pushed me to diversify \u2014 something that will hopefully make my business stronger and more resilient in the long run.\u201d",

      "Ukraine's gas facilities have suffered severe damage from Russian drone and missile attacks, forcing the country to import more gas",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The soil surrounding the gas facility in Ukraine was once pitch-black before it was burned to a rusty red by a massive Russian drone and missile assault.",
      "Scattered remnants of Shahed drones littered the reservoir designated for storing tanks of liquefied propane gas. Nearly a month after the Oct. 30 attack, several tanks lay empty and in ruins.",
      "\u201cIt hurts to look at all this (damage) because I saw firsthand (the facility\u2019s) establishment, construction and development,\u201d said Victor, who has worked there for 28 years and who cannot be named in full for security reasons. \u201cBut we have, what we have and we must continue to work.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press gained exclusive access to Naftogaz\u2019s gas extraction fields in central Ukraine last week. The AP is the first and only news outlet to be allowed to film and photograph war damage at the facilities. Due to strict security protocols, the AP cannot name the facility or its exact location.",
      "Russia has targeted Ukrainian gas extraction this year in a bid to hurt morale and force Ukraine to import large quantities of gas at market prices which it can ill afford. Without the attacks, Ukraine would be able to cover the overwhelming majority of its consumption using its domestic extraction.",
      "Two devastating attacks on Ukraine\u2019s gas extraction facilities in March and October mean the country must import an additional 4.4 billion cubic meters this winter.",
      "To fill the gap, the Ukrainian state gas company, Naftogaz, said it is negotiating with U.S. government lenders to secure financing to buy American liquefied natural gas.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s energy crisis has played into the negotiations for a peace deal over the past week, a senior Ukrainian official told AP on condition of anonymity because they\u2019re not authorized to speak to the media.",
      "\u201cIt is urgent because of Ukraine\u2019s energy situation, urgent because of what Ukrainians need this winter, urgent in terms of the fight,\u201d the official said. The attacks on the country\u2019s electricity and gas infrastructure are imposing heavy costs on Ukraine and its economy a scenario that could repeat next year if the war continues.",
      "Gas is vital for Ukrainians to heat their homes in winters that can reach -20 Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit), as well as for centralized hot water systems. It is also essential for Ukraine's industry and, in some cases, it's used to generate electricity.",
      "\u201cGiven that gas infrastructure has no relation to military needs, the destruction of gas extraction, gas storage, gas transportation has only one aim: manic terror attacks so that Ukrainians are left without gas, heating and electricity\u201d said Serhii Koretskyi, Naftogaz\u2019s CEO, in an interview in Kyiv on Friday.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s domestic extraction facilities produce roughly 21 billion cubic meters of gas per year, according to the last published data from its energy regulator in 2023, before Russia began to attack gas infrastructure in earnest. Without attacks, it would still then need import 2 to 3 billion cubic meters a year, said Koretskyi.",
      "But the second major attack in late October devastated extraction capabilities, meaning Ukraine needs to import an additional 4.4 billion cubic meters, at a cost of roughly $2 billion, said Koretskyi, noting that some parts of the extraction system had been successfully repaired.",
      "Naftogaz has secured 70% of the money needed for the 4.4 billion cubic meters, mostly through European loans and a few grants, said Koretskyi. He said they are trying to obtain the remaining 30% through a loan from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and EXIM, another US government lender.",
      "But Naftogaz has not previously borrowed from the U.S. and time is of the essence. \u201cThis money was needed the day before yesterday. It takes time to buy it, bring it, deliver it, pump it, release it,\u201d said Koretskyi.",
      "Naftogaz is currently importing 25-30 million cubic meters per day, learning from the experience of previous years to avoid spiking prices for Ukraine and inside Europe with big, sudden purchases, Koretskyi said.",

      "Ukraine took several steps to bring its gas market in line with European Union requirements after it signed an EU association agreement in 2014. But Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022 halted its effort on the most crucial element: sustained market prices for households.",
      "At present, the state covers around 50% of the real market price, according to the country\u2019s memorandum with the International Monetary Fund published in July. This means Naftogaz is not making any money from gas sold to household consumers.",
      "\u201cAs long as this issue (of subsidies) is not resolved, there will be a financial hole in the liquidity and in the operational results of Naftogaz,\u201d said energy expert Victoria Voytsitska, a Ukrainian lawmaker from 2014 to 2019 and member of the think tank We Build Ukraine.",

      "Former Naftogaz CEO Yurii Vitrenko, a gas expert, estimates at least 30% of the population can afford to pay market prices for gas, electricity and heating, while the rest can apply for support. Vitrenko added that if the government gave payments direct to consumers, it could motivate people to use less gas in order to keep more of the money.",
      "\u201cIt would result in Ukraine having to import less gas,\u201d he said. However, he cautioned, \u201cIt should be done thoughtfully, being mindful of the need to maintain social cohesion\u201d.",

      "The grocery store is the default resource in the U.S. for fresh food",
      "The pollution from food is sneaky. Because the apple sitting on your kitchen counter isn't really causing any harm.",
      "But chances are good that you didn't pick it from a tree in your backyard. It required land and water to grow, machines to harvest and process, packaging to ship, trucks to transport and often refrigerators to store. Much of that process releases planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "That's why the global food system makes up roughly a third of worldwide, human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, according to the EDGAR FOOD pollution database.",
      "Meanwhile, roughly a third of the U.S. food supply is lost or wasted without being eaten, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It might never get harvested, it might spoil in transit or the grocery store might reject it for being the wrong size or color. That's a big reason why some consumers are looking for less-wasteful alternatives ranging from farmers markets to delivery services for produce that didn't meet supermarket size or appearance standards.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole breadth of opportunities to purchase food,\u201d said Julia Van Soelen Kim, food systems adviser with the University of California Cooperative Extension.",
      "And during the week of Thanksgiving, this decision is especially high stakes because lots of grocery shoppers are buying for extra guests, and more food can mean a bigger climate impact.",
      "Here are tips for reducing impact by shopping beyond the grocery store.",
      "Jane Kolodinsky, professor emerita at the University of Vermont and director of research at Arrowleaf Consulting, has bought her produce directly from a local farmer for 30 years.",
      "It\u2019s called Community Supported Agriculture, or CSA. At the beginning of every harvest season, Kolodinsky pays that farm a fee. Then, once per week, she picks up a box of produce at the farm. Some CSA programs pick the produce, while others let you customize. Some deliver. An online database shows which farms participate in CSA programs.",
      "Since the food is grown nearby, there is less processing and packaging. \u201cThere's a smaller carbon footprint for purchasing locally compared to global or national food distribution channels,\u201d said Van Soelen Kim. \u201cWhen they\u2019re local, they\u2019re traveling less distance, so less gas, less fuel.\u201d",
      "Local farmers are also likely to grow whatever works best for the area's climate and season. \u201cWhen things are in season, they need less storage time, so less electricity for cold storage,\u201d said Van Soelen Kim, who added that can also mean a smaller food bill.",
      "It\u2019s not pollution-free, because the crops still require land and water, and the food does travel some distance. But CSAs avoid many steps in the modern food supply chain.",
      "That model is challenging for consumers who want to maintain the same shopping list year-round. Shopping in-season requires more flexibility. \u201cI would encourage consumers to think, \u2019OK, year-round we want some hand fruit that\u2019s firm,'\u201d she said. \u201cSo maybe it\u2019s apples, and then it\u2019s pears, and then its gonna move to kiwis, and then is gonna move to pluots.\u201d",
      "And in colder regions, she said there is still local produce. It's just more likely to be dried, frozen or canned.",
      "Kolodinsky said the oldest alternative food system is the farmers market, where vendors gather and sell directly to consumers. Growers also sell at farm stands that aren\u2019t tied to a centralized, scheduled event.",
      "Farmers markets allow consumers more flexibility to pick the produce than a typical CSA. They also offer seasonal produce and less packaging and processing than a grocery store. Many also accept payment associated with government food assistance programs.",

      "Farmers who sell to grocery stores typically have to meet high standards, Woods said. For example, there could be onions that never got big enough or the carrot that grew two roots \u2014 vegetables that are just as safe and tasty to eat. There's also surplus harvest.",
      "\u201cThey will intentionally not pick certain melons that are undersized out in the field.

We\u2019ll send a team out there to pick those,\u2019\u201d said Woods.",
      "He said services delivering food that doesn\u2019t meet supermarket size or appearance requirements, such as Misfit Markets or Imperfect Produce, have become more popular in recent years.",
      "Van Soelen Kim said there isn't a lot of data yet on whether these services have a significantly lower climate impact. They reduce food waste, but the food might come from far away.",
      "Misfits Market refreshes its online selection weekly. Customers then fill a box of often discounted groceries that might have misprinted labels or are undersized or blemished. They are delivered via a company truck or third-party courier such as FedEx. The company's founder and CEO, Abhi Ramesh, said it minimizes emissions by having set delivery days instead of offering on-demand delivery.",
      "\u201cBy doing that, we batch all of our deliveries together. So it is one van to your ZIP code on that day. One truck that goes from our warehouse on that date,\u201d he said.",
      "Ramesh said sometimes a farmer's market or CSA is even better at offering nearby seasonal food than his company. But for a lot of the country, those services go away when the harvest season ends. \u201cAnd so your local grocery store, believe it or not, is still transporting that from California. But the difference is we\u2019re able to go and transport the food waste piece, which reduces a ton of emissions.\u201d",
      "Woods' advice for using services like Misfits Market is the same as other channels: Eat seasonally, eat locally and look for minimal packaging.",

    "story": [
      "Bird flu and another disease have shrunk the U.S. turkey population to a 40-year low this year",
      "CHELSEA, Mich. -- Old Brick Farm, where Larry Doll raises chickens, turkeys and ducks, was fortunate this Thanksgiving season.",
      "Doll's small farm west of Detroit had no cases of bird flu, despite an ongoing outbreak that killed more than 2 million U.S. turkeys in the last three months alone. He also avoided another disease, avian metapneumovirus, which causes turkeys to lay fewer eggs.",
      "\u201cI try to keep the operation as clean as possible, and not bringing other animals in from other farms helps mitigate that risk as well,\u201d said Doll, whose farm has been in his family for five generations.",
      "But Doll still saw the impact as those diseases shrank the U.S. turkey flock to a 40-year low this year. The hatchery where he gets his turkey chicks had fewer available this year. He plans to order another 100 hatchlings soon, even though they won\u2019t arrive until July.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get your order in early, you\u2019re not going to get it,\u201d he said.",
      "The shrinking population is expected to cause wholesale turkey prices to rise 44% this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the increase, many stores are offering discounted or even free turkeys to soften the potential blow to Thanksgiving meal budgets. But even if the bird is cheaper than last year, the ingredients to prepare the rest of the holiday feast may not be. Tariffs on imported steel, for example, have increased prices for canned goods.",
      "As of Nov. 17, a basket of 11 Thanksgiving staples \u2014 including a 10-pound frozen turkey, 10 Russet potatoes, a box of stuffing and cans of corn, green beans and cranberry sauce \u2013 cost $58.81, or 4.1% more than last year, according to Datasembly, a market research company that surveys weekly prices at 150,000 U.S. stores. That\u2019s higher than the average price increase for food eaten at home, which rose 2.7% in September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Datasembly showed a 2% decline in the retail price of a 10-pound turkey as of Nov. 17. Pricing out Thanksgiving meals isn\u2019t an exact science, and the firm's tally differed from other estimates.",
      "The American Farm Bureau Federation, which uses volunteer shoppers in all 50 states to survey prices, reported that Thanksgiving dinner for 10 would cost $55.16 this year, or 5% less than last year. The Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, using NielsenIQ data from September, estimated that feeding 10 people on Thursday using store-brand products would cost $80 this year, which is 2% to 3% lower than last year's estimate.",
      "Grocery chains are also offering deals to attract shoppers. Discount grocer Aldi is advertising a $40 meal for 10 with 21 items. Kroger said shoppers could feed 10 people for under $50 with its menu of store-brand products.",
      "Earlier this month, President Donald Trump touted Walmart\u2019s Thanksgiving meal basket, which he said was 25% cheaper than last year. But that was because Walmart included a different assortment and fewer products overall this year.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing some promotions being implemented in an effort to draw customers into the store,\u201d David Ortega, a professor of food economics and policy at Michigan State University, said.",
      "That's despite a sharp increase in wholesale turkey prices since August. In the second week of November, frozen 8-16 pound hens were averaging $1.77 per pound, up 81% from the same period last year, according to Mark Jordan, the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, which closely follows the poultry and livestock markets.",

      "Avian viruses are the main culprit. But another reason for turkey\u2019s higher wholesale prices has been an increase in consumer demand as other meats have gotten more expensive, Jordan said. Beef prices were up 14% in September compared to last year, for example.",
      "\u201cFor a big chunk of the population, they look at steak cuts and say, \u2018I can\u2019t or I don\u2019t want to pay $30 a pound,\u2019\u201d Jordan said.",
      "That\u2019s the case for Paul Nadeau, a retired consultant from Austin, Texas, who plans to smoke a turkey this week. Nadeau said he usually smokes a brisket over Thanksgiving weekend, but the beef brisket he buys would now cost more than $100. Turkey prices are also up at his local H-E-B supermarket, he said, but not by as much.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of anything that\u2019s down in price since last year except for eggs,\u201d Nadeau said.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum are also raising prices. Farok Contractor, a distinguished professor of management and global business at the Rutgers Business School, said customers are paying 10 cents to 40 cents more per can when companies pass on the full cost of tariffs.",
      "Tariffs may be partly to blame for the increased cost of jellied cranberry sauce, which was up 38% from last year in Datasembly\u2019s survey. But weather was also a factor. U.S. cranberry production is expected to be down 9% this year, hurt by drought conditions in Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "In Illinois, where most of the country\u2019s canning pumpkins are grown, dry weather actually helped pumpkins avoid diseases that are more prevalent in wet conditions, said Raghela Scavuzzo, an associate director of food systems development at the Illinois Farm Bureau and the executive director of the Illinois Specialty Growers Association. Datasembly found that a 30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix cost 5% less than last year.",
      "Back at Old Brick Farm, which has been in his family since 1864, Doll walked among his turkeys the week before Thanksgiving, patting their heads as they waddled between their warm barn and an open pasture. In a few days, he planned to deliver them to an Amish butcher.",
      "Doll sold all 92 turkeys he raised this year, with customers paying $6.50 per pound for what many tell him is the best turkey they've ever tasted. He enjoys a little profit, he said, and the good feeling of supplying a holiday meal.",
      "\u201cI just love it, to think that, you know, not only are we providing them food, but the centerpiece of their Thanksgiving dinner,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cWe compare a number of things when looking at teams closely ranked together,\u201d Yurachek said. \u201cWe've got some teams ranked between Miami and Notre Dame, such as Alabama and BYU, who we're also comparing Miami to.\u201d",

      "Word from Oxford is that a decision will come on Kiffin's potential move to LSU or Florida after this week's game against Mississippi State. An Ole Miss team without one of the most sought-after coaches in the game wouldn't seem as good as one with him.",

      "After Oregon's 42-27 win over USC, coach Dan Lanning said his team deserves credit for the schedule it plays \u2014 which included a tough conference game during a week in which many in the SEC were going against non-ranked, double-digit underdogs.",

      "Since Marc Buoniconti",
      "Marc Buoniconti said his father, the late NFL Hall of Famer Nick Buoniconti, explained the secret to the success of their nonprofit and its fundraising efforts simply: \u201cWe\u2019re just not good listeners.\u201d",
      "In the 40 years since Marc Buoniconti, then a college football linebacker at the Citadel, was paralyzed during a routine tackle, they have been told countless times that it was a problem that couldn\u2019t be fixed. The Buonicontis didn\u2019t listen.",
      "Instead, through the fund that bears their name, they have helped raise more than $550 million for The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, and improved the lives of millions with spinal cord and brain injuries.",
      "\u201cThe Buoniconti Fund has lasted because we\u2019re relentless,\u201d Marc Buoniconti recently told The Associated Press. \u201cWe never give up. When we see a challenge, we face it head-on and don\u2019t stop until we find a solution. It\u2019s that determination, that refusal to quit that\u2019s kept us going all these years.\u201d",
      "That drive has also led The Miami Project to expand its work beyond curing paralysis. Its research center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine now also studies neurological diseases and disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and it is testing the brain-computer interface implant from Elon Musk\u2019s technology company Neuralink.",
      "Dr. Barth A. Green, chairman of The Miami Project, who co-founded the organization in 1985 with Nick Buoniconti, says the most surprising developments from the center have been the broadest ones.",
      "\u201cEvery operating room in the world that puts people to sleep monitors their nervous system for safety,\u201d Dr. Green said. \u201cThat was all developed at The Miami Project.\u201d",
      "Therapeutic hypothermia, where the body is cooled after an injury to protect the brain and spinal cord, is another widely used treatment developed at the center.",
      "Dr. Green said that before Buoniconti\u2019s accident he had been working on helping those who had been paralyzed for 20 years. Yet there wasn\u2019t a hub for that work until The Miami Project was established.",
      "It provided a home for him and \u201cthousands of scientists and researchers in Miami and around the world, who were equally engaged by the opportunity to change people\u2019s everyday quality of life and their opportunities to have more function and a better opportunity to be mobile and do things they never dreamt they could before.\u201d",
      "Miami Project Scientific Director W. Dalton Dietrich III said gathering those people from a variety of disciplines \u2013 neuroscientists, researchers, clinicians, biomedical engineers \u2013 into one building has led to unexpected advances.",
      "\u201cNot one particular treatment is going to cure paralysis,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve tried to look at other disciplines to bring into the project to help us achieve that goal.\u201d",
      "One new, multidisciplinary area, neuromodulation, is \u201csomething we never thought about five years ago,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an exciting area where you can stimulate these residual circuits after brain injury or spinal cord injury in patients and they start moving their limbs.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat started as a promise to help me walk again became a mission to help millions,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery resource, every dollar, every hour given is a testament to the belief that we can change lives.\u201d",
      "Mark Dalton, chairman and CEO of Tudor Investment Corp., said that belief resonated with him and made him want to get involved with The Buonicontis even before he met them.",
      "\u201cI had tremendous admiration for him as a father who was never going to give up on finding a cure for what ailed his son,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cAnd his son was a representation of millions of other people.\u201d",
      "Once he learned more about The Miami Project, Dalton said he was impressed by its science-driven approach. Its setting on a university campus was also important to the former chairman of the board of trustees at Denison and Vanderbilt universities.",
      "\u201cThey put the line in the water,\u201d said Dalton, who now chairs the Buoniconti Fund\u2019s biggest annual fundraiser, The Great Sports Legends Dinner. \u201cThey hooked me. I\u2019m all in.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a common feeling around The Miami Project, which counts legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus and Grammy winner Gloria Estefan among its supporters. And it\u2019s something Marc Buoniconti says he does not take for granted.",
      "He hopes The Miami Project\u2019s work will continue to expand.",
      "\u201cMy biggest dream is for our researchers to find a way to fully repair the nervous system,\u201d Buoniconti said. \u201cWhen we do that, we\u2019ll change the entire landscape for paralysis and so many other neuro conditions. We\u2019ll give so many people their lives back. That\u2019s what keeps me going, and that\u2019s what makes every struggle to this point worth it.\u201d",

      "A federal judge called out an immigration enforcement agent for using artificial intelligence to write the narrative of a use-of-force report as just a small part of a scathing opinion that rebutted federal officials' narratives about appropriate force...",
      "Tucked in a two-sentence footnote in a voluminous court opinion, a federal judge recently called out immigration agents using artificial intelligence to write use-of-force reports, raising concerns that it could lead to inaccuracies and further erode public confidence in how police have handled the immigration crackdown in the Chicago area and ensuing protests.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis wrote the footnote in a 223-page opinion issued last week, noting that the practice of using ChatGPT to write use-of-force reports undermines the agents\u2019 credibility and \u201cmay explain the inaccuracy of these reports.\u201d She described what she saw in at least one body camera video, writing that an agent asks ChatGPT to compile a narrative for a report after giving the program a brief sentence of description and several images.",
      "The judge noted factual discrepancies between the official narrative about those law enforcement responses and what body camera footage showed. But experts say the use of AI to write a report that depends on an officer\u2019s specific perspective without using an officer\u2019s actual experience is the worst possible use of the technology and raises serious concerns about accuracy and privacy.",
      "Law enforcement agencies across the country have been grappling with how to create guardrails that allow officers to use the increasingly available AI technology while maintaining accuracy, privacy and professionalism. Experts said the example recounted in the opinion didn't meet that challenge.",
      "\u201cWhat this guy did is the worst of all worlds. Giving it a single sentence and a few pictures \u2014 if that\u2019s true, if that\u2019s what happened here \u2014 that goes against every bit of advice we have out there. It\u2019s a nightmare scenario,\u201d said Ian Adams, assistant criminology professor at the University of South Carolina who serves on a task force on artificial intelligence through the Council for Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear if the agency had guidelines or policies on the use of AI by agents. The body camera footage cited in the order has not yet been released.",
      "Adams said few departments have put policies in place, but those that have often prohibit the use of predictive AI when writing reports justifying law enforcement decisions, especially use-of-force reports. Courts have established a standard referred to as objective reasonableness when considering whether a use of force was justified, relying heavily on the perspective of the specific officer in that specific scenario.",
      "\u201cWe need the specific articulated events of that event and the specific thoughts of that specific officer to let us know if this was a justified use of force,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat is the worst case scenario, other than explicitly telling it to make up facts, because you\u2019re begging it to make up facts in this high-stakes situation.\u201d",
      "Besides raising concerns about an AI-generated report inaccurately characterizing what happened, the use of AI also raises potential privacy concerns.",
      "Katie Kinsey, chief of staff and tech policy counsel at the Policing Project at NYU School of Law, said if the agent in the order was using a public ChatGPT version, he probably didn't understand he lost control of the images the moment he uploaded them, allowing them to be part of the public domain and potentially used by bad actors.",
      "Kinsey said from a technology standpoint most departments are building the plane as it\u2019s being flown when it comes to AI. She said it\u2019s often a pattern in law enforcement to wait until new technologies are already being used and in some cases mistakes being made to then talk about putting guidelines or policies in place.",

We can start from transparency.\u201d",

      "The photographs the officer used to generate a narrative also caused accuracy concerns for some experts.",
      "Well-known tech companies like Axon have begun offering AI components with their body cameras to assist in writing incident reports. Those AI programs marketed to police operate on a closed system and largely limit themselves to using audio from body cameras to produce narratives because the companies have said programs that attempt to use visuals are not effective enough for use.",
      "\u201cThere are many different ways to describe a color, or a facial expression or any visual component. You could ask any AI expert and they would tell you prompts return very different results between different AI applications, and that gets complicated with a visual component,\u201d said Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.",

      "Since legalization and commercialization, daily cannabis use has become a defining \u2014 and often invisible \u2014 part of many people\u2019s lives. High-potency vapes and concentrates now dominate the market, and doctors say they can blur the line between relief and dependence over time so that users don\u2019t notice the shift.

Many who develop cannabis use disorder say it\u2019s hard to recognize the signs because of the widespread belief that marijuana isn\u2019t addictive. Because the consequences tend to creep in gradually \u2014 brain fog, irritability, dependence \u2014 users often miss when therapeutic use shifts into compulsion.",

      "Chinese companies are rushing to deploy low-flying vehicles and drones for various uses as the country finds innovative ways to drive its economy",
      "HONG KONG -- An unmanned, oval-shaped craft from flying taxi maker EHang hovers, whirring noisily like a mini-helicopter over a riverside innovation zone on the outskirts of the southern Chinese business hub of Guangzhou, part of a trial of a mini-flying taxi that once might have been found only in sci-fi films.",
      "In nearby Shenzhen, food-delivery drones already are part of daily life and a novelty attraction for tourists, even if such services cost more. In the waterfront park surrounded by high-rises, Polish tourist Karolina Trzcia\u0144ska and her friends ordered bubble tea and lemon tea by phone, just to give it a try. Their drinks arrived via a drone buzzing through the drizzle about 30 minutes later.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m seeing something like this, so it was super fun to see the food being delivered by the drone,\" she said.",
      "Such businesses are growing quickly with support from the government, though the take off of the so-called \u201clow-altitude economy\u201d faces obstacles such as strict airspace controls and battery limitations.",
      "Activities in airspace below 1,000 meters (about 3,280 feet) accounted for business turnover worth 506 billion yuan ($70 billion) in 2023, about 0.4% of China\u2019s economy. By 2035, it's expected to hit 3.5 trillion yuan (about $490 billion), said Zhang Xiaolan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a think tank affiliated with China's main planning agency.",
      "Guangdong province, home to drone giant DJI with an estimated 70% of the global commercial drone market, leads in development of the low-altitude economy, followed by wealthy eastern coastal provinces Jiangsu and Zhejiang, near Shanghai, according to a report by a research unit of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University, and other institutions.",
      "Other big players in Guangdong include EHang, logistics company SF Express\u2019s drone arm Phoenix Wings, and automaker XPENG\u2019s flying car unit ARIDGE.",
      "In October, Guangdong announced it plans to speed up construction of flight service stations and platforms to facilitate airspace operations and will support locally issued discount vouchers for low-altitude tourism.",
      "Its technology and financial hub Shenzhen has launched a 15-million-yuan ($2.1 million) award for companies that earn certifications required for passenger eVTOLs, short for \u201celectric vertical take-off and landing\" vehicles that lift off the ground like helicopters, among other incentives.",
      "China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration has granted certificates allowing EHang to offer commercial passenger services with its pilotless eVTOL, a low-altitude aircraft that can reach speeds of 130 kph (81 mph) with a maximum range of 30 kilometers (19 miles).",
      "EHang hasn\u2019t launched commercial routes, but its vice president, He Tianxing, says it aims to start with aerial sightseeing services. The company has been building takeoff and landing sites in 20 Chinese cities over the past two years. He expects aircraft of various companies will be flying multiple routes, possibly after five years.",

      "\u201cIt can\u2019t just be a research product, nor an engineer\u2019s toy,\u201d he said.",
      "The biggest challenge for developing eVTOL aircraft is maintaining longer flights and overcoming battery capacity limitations, said Guo Liming, co-founder of Shenzhen-based Skyevtol, whose single-seat manned eVTOL aircraft, priced at around $100,000, can only fly 20 to 30 minutes before it must be charged.",
      "It also has not all been smooth skies.",
      "In September, two XPENG's eVTOL aircraft collided after a rehearsal for an exhibition and one of them caught fire while landing. The company said no one was hurt, but another expo canceled flying demonstrations a week later.",

      "Less than one-third of China's low-altitude airspace was accessible for general aviation use in 2023 and there were problems with uneven distribution and a lack of internet connectivity, Zhang, the State Information Center researcher, said in a report. The number of registered general aviation aerodromes in China, excluding private airports, was just about a tenth of those in the U.S., she said.",

But development of the technologies involved and safety concerns and public acceptance will determine how quickly different applications of drones and low-flying vehicles are adopted.",

      "\u201cThe serious harms that AI chatbots have inflicted on children are well-documented, including fostering obsessive use, having explicit sexual conversations, and encouraging unsafe behaviors, violence against others, and self-harm,\u201d Fairplay said.",
      "AI toys, made by companies such as Curio Interactive and Keyi Technologies, are often marketed as educational, but Fairplay says they can displace important creative and learning activities. They promise friendship but also disrupt children\u2019s relationships and resilience, the group said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,\u201d said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay\u2019s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the amount of trust young children are putting in these toys can exacerbate the harms seen with older children.",
      "Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for more than 10 years. They just weren\u2019t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel\u2019s talking Hello Barbie doll that it said was recording and analyzing children\u2019s conversations.",
      "\u201cEverything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,\u201d Franz said.",
      "It\u2019s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual \u201c Trouble in Toyland \u201d report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered magnets and button-sized batteries that young children can swallow. This year, the organization tested four toys that use AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cWe found some of these toys will talk in-depth about sexually explicit topics, will offer advice on where a child can find matches or knives, act dismayed when you say you have to leave, and have limited or no parental controls,\u201d the report said.",
      "Dr. Dana Suskind, a pediatric surgeon and social scientist who studies early brain development, said young children don't have the conceptual tools to understand what an AI companion is. While kids have always bonded with toys through imaginative play, when they do this they use their imagination to create both sides of a pretend conversation, \u201cpracticing creativity, language, and problem-solving,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAn AI toy collapses that work. It answers instantly, smoothly, and often better than a human would. We don\u2019t yet know the developmental consequences of outsourcing that imaginative labor to an artificial agent\u2014but it\u2019s very plausible that it undercuts the kind of creativity and executive function that traditional pretend play builds,\u201d Suskind said.",

      "Sometimes our immune system runs amok and attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus\u201d \u2014 the brain",
      "\u201cMy year of unraveling\u201d is how a despairing Christy Morrill described nightmarish months when his immune system hijacked his brain.",
      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness.

      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty daunting, challenging reality when half of our water isn\u2019t necessarily going to be reliable for the future,\" said Brian Richter, president of Sustainable Waters and a senior fellow with the World Wildlife Fund. \u201cSo we have to really address that.\"",
      "By breaking down the balance sheet, the researchers are hopeful policymakers and regulators can determine where water use can be reduced and how to balance supply with demand.",
      "Warnings of what was to come first cropped up in the late 19th century when irrigation in Colorado\u2019s San Luis Valley began to dry the snowmelt-fed river, resulting in diminished flows as far south as El Paso, Texas. Now, some stretches of the river run dry for months at a time. The Big Bend area and even Albuquerque have seen dry cracked mud replace the river more often in recent years.",
      "Irrigating crops by far is the largest direct use of water in the basin at 87%, according to the study. Meanwhile, losses to evaporation and uptake by vegetation along the river account for more than half of overall consumption in the basin, a factor that can't be dismissed as reservoir storage shrinks.",
      "The irrigation season has become shorter, with canals drying up as early as June in some cases, despite a growing season in the U.S. and Mexico that typically lasts through October.",
      "In central New Mexico, farmers got a boost with summer rains. However, farmers along the Texas portion of the Pecos River and in the Rio Conchos basin of Mexico \u2014 both tributaries within the basin \u2014 did not receive any surface water supplies.",
      "\u201cA key part of this is really connecting the urban populations to what\u2019s going on out on these farms. These farmers are really struggling. A lot of them are on the brink of bankruptcy,\" Richter said, linking water shortages to shrinking farms, smaller profits and less ability to afford labor and equipment.",

      "The analysis found that between 2000-2019, water shortages contributed to the loss of 18% of farmland in the headwaters in Colorado, 36% along the Rio Grande in New Mexico and 49% in the Pecos River tributary in New Mexico and Texas.",
      "With fewer farms, less water went to irrigation in the U.S. However, researchers said irrigation in the Mexican portion of the basin has increased greatly.",
      "The World Wildlife Fund and Sustainable Waters are working with researchers at the University of New Mexico to survey farmers on solutions to the water crisis.",
      "Jason Casuga, the chief engineer and CEO of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, said he is not surprised by the findings and was particularly interested in the data on how much water is lost to riparian areas along the river. He talked about his crews clearing thick walls of thirsty invasive salt cedar trees, describing it as an unnatural ecosystem that stemmed from human efforts to manage the river with levees and reservoirs.",
      "While cities and farmers try to conserve, Casuga said there are few rules placed on consumption by riparian areas.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re willing to accept hundreds and hundreds of acres of invasive species choking out native species. And I'm hoping a study like this will cause people to think and ask those kinds of questions because I think our bosque is worth fighting for. As a culture in New Mexico, agriculture is worth fighting for,\u201d he said.",
      "The responses to overuse and depletion are as varied as the jurisdictions through which the river flows, said Enrique Prunes, a co-author of the study and the manager of the World Wildlife Fund's Rio Grande Program.",
      "He pointed to Colorado, where water managers have threatened to shut off groundwater wells if the aquifer that supports irrigated farms cannot be stabilized. There, farmers who pump groundwater pay fees that are used to incentivize other farmers to fallow their fields.",
      "New Mexico's fallowing program is voluntary, but changes could be in store if the U.S. Supreme Court signs off on proposed settlements stemming from a long-running dispute with Texas and the federal government over management of the Rio Grande and groundwater use. New Mexico has acknowledged it will have to curb groundwater pumping.",

      "BELEM, Brazil -- Negotiators at the United Nations climate talks will soon decide on a newly forged final deal released on Saturday that does not include a plan to wean the world from the coal, oil and gas that is heating the planet.",
      "While guidelines wanted by 80 nations for a fossil fuel phase-out are not in the document called \u201cUniting humanity in a global mobilization against climate change,\u201d the Brazilian presidency has promised it will join Colombia in coming up with an independent road map that's not needed to be approved by all 190 nations.",

Some nations could try to scuttle it if they prefer no deal to what they consider a feeble agreement, but Morgan said she doubted that any country will block the agreement. It was crafted after more than 12 hours of late night and early morning meetings in COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago's office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a weak outcome,\" said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.",
      "A fossil fuel transition plan will be in a separate proposal issued later by do Lago's team that won't carry the same weight as a deal accepted by nations at the conference.",
      "In the text, instead of a transition plan away from fossil fuels, the agreement \u201cacknowledges that the global transition toward low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future,\u201d and says \u201cthe (2015) Paris Agreement is working and resolves to go further and faster.\u201d",
      "The annual talks this year are held in Belem, a Brazilian city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. They were scheduled to wrap up Friday, but negotiators blew past that deadline and worked through the night.",
      "Some of the biggest issues include how to distribute $300 billion a year \u2014 a sum previously agreed upon \u2014 in financial aid for vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change, getting countries to toughen up their national plans to reduce Earth-warming emissions and dealing with climate trade barriers. Poorer nations have requested a tripling of financial aid for adapting to extreme weather and other climate change harms. While that's in the deal, the deadline has been moved back five years to 2035.",
      "Also included in the agreement is the final result of the Action Agenda, which was a list of initiatives aimed at making progress on past deals. That included: a promise of $1 trillion for improving energy grids and infrastructure; ramping up the production of biofuels; industrial decarbonization plans in developing countries; $5.5 billion toward a fund to pay countries to keep their forests standing; and other pledges of funding, including from the private sector, for projects in areas like farming and adaptation.",
      "Whatever deal is proposed still needs a consensus approval from what\u2019s left of the nearly 200 nations that came to the two-week conference. Some delegates, observers and others had to leave Saturday morning when the cruise ships lodging them set sail.",

      "Agreements coming out of COP30 technically have to be approved by consensus. But in the past, individual countries' objections have been overlooked by the chair in the rush to gavel everything to the end.",
      "One of the points that negotiators will highlight is language sprinkled in the document that won\u2019t be an explicit road map away from fossil fuels, but will refer back to previous agreements to maintain momentum and \"live and fight another day,\u201d said Alden Meyer, a veteran analyst for the European think-tank E3G.",

      "The White House has launched a new Ukraine-Russia peace push in recent weeks.",
      "LONDON and KYIV, Ukraine -- The Kremlin's top foreign policy aide, Yury Ushakov, confirmed there is a \"preliminary agreement\" for U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff -- and likely Jared Kushner -- to visit Moscow next week, as the White House claims momentum toward a possible Ukraine-Russia peace plan.",
      "\"As for Witkoff, I can say that a preliminary agreement has been reached that he will visit Moscow next week,\" Ushakov said in an interview with journalist Pavel Zarubin for the program \"Moscow. Kremlin. Putin,\" broadcast on Wednesday.",
      "\"We have agreed to meet with Mr. Witkoff. I hope he will not come alone, but will be accompanied by other representatives of the American team who are working on the Ukrainian dossier, and then we will begin discussions,\" Ushakov added.",
      "Witkoff, Ushakov said, will \"definitely\" meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin if he comes to Moscow next week.",
      "The interview came after Bloomberg published excerpts of a recording of purported phone call between Witkoff and Ushakov, in which Trump's envoy appeared to offer guidance on how Putin should present the Kremlin's plan to end the war to Trump.",
      "Ushakov appeared to confirm the call happened but declined to comment. Ushakov also alleged that the leak was intended to undermine the ongoing peace efforts.",
      "\"I speak with Witkoff quite often, but I do not comment on the substance of our conversations because they are confidential. No one should comment on them, actually,\" he said.",
      "The reported leak was \"probably\" intended to \"hinder\" discussions, Ushakov said. \"It is unlikely that this is being done to improve relations. They are now being established, with difficulty, through contacts of this kind, including by telephone.\"",
      "Ushakov denied that Russia leaked the call. \"Someone is leaking them, someone is listening in, but it's not us,\" he said.",
      "In a separate interview with Russia's Kommersant newspaper published Wednesday, Ushakov said he regularly contacted Witkoff \"via secure communication\" and via WhatsApp.",
      "Ushakov then suggested that the leak could have been organized by Witkoff's detractors.",

I'm not sure about Jared going, but he's involved in the process, smart guy, and they're going to be meeting with President Putin, I believe, next week in Moscow,\" he said.",
      "Pressed on the Bloomberg report and concerns that Witkoff was too sympathetic to Russia's maximalist war goals, Trump replied, \"No, but that's a standard thing, you know, because he's got to sell this to Ukraine. He's got to sell Ukraine to Russia. That's what he's, that's what a deal maker does.\"",
      "\"You got to say, look, they want this. You've got to convince him with this. You know, that's a very standard form of negotiation. I haven't heard it, but I heard it was standard negotiation, and I would imagine he's saying the same thing to Ukraine, because each party has to give and take,\" Trump added.",
      "Asked whether Witkoff was \"too pro-Russia,\" Trump did not answer directly. He instead said\u00a0 that a deal would be beneficial for both sides, while appearing to talk up Russia's military capabilities.",
      "\"I think, look, this war could go on for years, and Russia's got a lot more people, a lot more soldiers,\" Trump said. \"So I think if Ukraine can make a deal, it's a good thing. I think it's great for both. Frankly, I think it's great for both.\"",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week the blueprint \"could also form the basis for a final peace settlement,\" and suggested it aligned closely with the outcomes of his meeting with Trump in Alaska in August.",
      "On Monday, a Ukrainian official close to the matter told ABC News that the original 28-point draft had been revised down to 19 points after the Geneva talks, with both American and Ukrainian representatives framing the Geneva talks as productive.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that the Geneva talks produced a \"framework,\" adding Kyiv is \"ready to move forward together -- with the United States of America, with personal engagement of President Trump, and with Europe.\"",
      "\"I am ready to meet with President Trump,\" Zelenskyy continued. \"There are sensitive points to discuss,\" he said.",
      "After the Geneva meetings, a U.S. delegation held additional talks with Russian and Ukrainian representatives in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. A U.S. official told ABC News on Tuesday, \"The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal ... There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal.\"",
      "A source familiar with the discussions confirmed to ABC News that Ukraine agreed to the new 19-point peace plan during the talks in Geneva, not in Abu Dhabi.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump did not elaborate on which issues are still to be agreed with Kyiv. \"Standard things,\" Trump said when asked. \"But people are starting to realize it's a good deal for both parties if they got to stop the war, they're losing a lot of people, a lot of soldiers, mostly soldiers.\"",
      "Pressed about Ukraine ceding land to Russia, Trump hinted at land swaps and called the overall process \"complicated\" and said it \"doesn't go that quickly.\"",
      "Trump also did not say what concessions Moscow is being asked to make. \"They're making concessions. They're big concessions. You say stop fighting, and they don't take any more land again,\" the president said.",
      "As to future security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump said the issue is being discussed with European countries. \"Europe will be largely involved in that,\" he said. \"We're working that out with Europe. Europe really wants to see it end, if possible.\"",
      "Moscow is yet to officially comment on the new 19-point plan. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned on Tuesday that \"if the spirit and letter of Anchorage are removed in terms of the key understandings that we have established, then, of course, it will be a fundamentally different situation.\"",
      "In his interview with Zarubin broadcast on Wednesday, Ushakov said the new plan was \"passed on to us,\" as quoted by Russia's state-run Tass news agency. But the Kremlin aide added that the plan \"hasn't been discussed in detail with anyone yet.\"",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, meanwhile, told reporters on Wednesday it is \"too early to say\" that the warring parties may be nearing a deal, according to Tass.",

      "U.S. applications for unemployment benefits in the week ending Nov. 22 dropped 6,000 from the previous week to 216,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. The figure is below the 230,000 forecast by economists, according to a survey by data provider FactSet.",
      "Applications for unemployment aid are seen as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. The job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS and Amazon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not yet be reflected in the claims data.",
      "The four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, dropped 1,000 to 223,750.",
      "For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a \u201clow-hire, low-fire\u201d state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low, but has left those out of work struggling to find a new job.",

      "Burt Meyer, the inventor behind iconic toys like Rock \u2019Em Sock \u2019Em Robots, Lite-Brite, and MouseTrap, has died at age 99",
      "Burt Meyer, who invented toys like Rock \u2019Em Sock \u2019Em Robots, Lite-Brite and MouseTrap in the 1960s that delighted generations of children, has died. He was 99.",
      "Meyer\u2019s creations arrived in the postwar boom, when plastic molding and mass production transformed how American kids played. That shift opened the door for more dynamic toys, and Meyer seized the moment with designs that would stay on shelves for decades.",
      "Meyer died on Oct. 30, said Rebecca Mathis, executive director at King-Bruwaert House, a retirement community in Burr Ridge, Illinois, where he lived.",
      "Meyer succeeded by straddling two often conflicting worlds, carrying a boundless childlike imagination alongside a pragmatic understanding of machines.",
      "The idea for Lite-Brite came in 1966 when Meyer was walking in Manhattan with Marvin Glass, who owned one of the largest toy design companies at the time, and the two men passed a window display featuring hundreds of colored lights. Engineers at the company doubted that electic lights could be safely adapted for children, according to Tim Walsh, who interviewed Meyer for his 2005 book \u201cTimeless Toys.\u201d",
      "Meyer, an employee at Marvin Glass & Associates, insisted it could.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s billions of ideas out there,\u201d Walsh wrote, \u201cbut executing them into a final creative solution is often the hard part.\u201d",
      "Meyer came up with a small backlit box and black paper sheets that allowed kids to create illuminated patterns. Lite-Brite was a hit, earning spots on Time Magazine\u2019s list of 100 greatest toys and in the Strong National Museum of Play\u2019s hall of fame. New versions are still being sold.",
      "Meyer had a similar role with a design team that reimagined a bulky boxing arcade game for home use. The original concept stalled in development after a featherweight boxer died from a brain injury, making any toy that invoked the tragedy unmarketable, company leaders thought.",
      "Meyer revisited the idea with a simple shift. \u201cThis is too good to pass up,\u201d he recalled saying in a 2010 interview. \u201cLet\u2019s take it away from humanity, let\u2019s make it robots. And we won\u2019t have them fall over, we\u2019ll have something funny happen.\u201d",
      "The result was Rock \u2019Em Sock \u2019Em Robots, a small game where players control the fighters\u2019 fists by pressing buttons on joysticks. A player wins by hitting the jaw of the opposing robot, theatrically popping up the spring-loaded head.",

His son, Steve Meyer, ran the business until 2006, according to The New York Times.",
      "Born in 1926 as Burton Carpenter Meyer, he enlisted in the Navy and served for two years as an aircraft mechanic. After retiring from toy making, he moved to Downers Grove, a suburb of Chicago, where he built small planes and could be seen deftly steering them aloft from a nearby private airfield well into his 80s.",
      "In interviews, Meyer often drew parallels between aerospace engineering and toy design, saying both required ingenutity and teamwork.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re flying the airplane, use every resource that you have in there. That\u2019s why we were able to turn out so many successful products,\u201d Meyer said, crediting his success to the highly collaborative environment at Marvin Glass & Associates.",

      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Shut down for more than six years, part of a scenic road loop in North Dakota's Theodore Roosevelt National Park will reopen Tuesday, giving visitors a better opportunity to see wildlife and panoramic views of the rugged Badlands.",
      "The park's 21-mile (34-kilometer) loop encircles a stark landscape where the 26th president wandered as a young man in the 1880s. The area includes colorful bluffs, dramatic formations from erosion and petrified tree stumps. Visitors enjoy encountering prairie dogs, bison and wild horses on the road.",
      "Storms, the erosive landscape and aging infrastructure caused a 150-foot (45-meter) section of roadway to slump in spring 2019, with sinkholes and other problems occurring later on the road, the National Park Service said. Since then, visitors have had to turn around at a certain point, unable to see views such as Scoria Point Overlook, a vista of red rock and rolling hills.",

      "The road is scheduled to reopen Tuesday, U.S. Sen. John Hoeven said. Construction lasted about two and a half years on a 6-mile (10-kilometer) closed segment, ending in October.",
      "The work encompassed full road reconstruction, drainage improvements, slope reconstruction and grading, and pavement resurfacing, the Park Service said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump didn't bring much holiday cheer Tuesday when bestowing ceremonial pardons on two Thanksgiving turkeys, dispensing more insults than goodwill at the traditional White House ritual.",
      "He joked about sending the turkeys to an infamous prison in El Salvador that has been used to house migrants deported from the United States. He said the birds should be named Chuck and Nancy \u2014 after Democratic stalwarts Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi \u2014 but \u201cI would never pardon those people.\u201d",

      "And all of that was before Trump turned his attention to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat who has resisted the White House's plans to deploy the National Guard in Chicago.",
      "Trump said he had a joke prepared about Pritzker, but \u201cI refuse to talk about the fact that he's a fat slob. I don't mention it.\u201d",
      "Scattered laughter rippled through the audience, which sat under cloudy skies and an intermittent drizzle on the Rose Garden patio.",
      "Trump eventually got around to the business at hand, which was pardoning the turkeys Gobble and Waddle. Both were spared the dinner table, but only one got the spotlight.",
      "\u201cGobble, I just want to tell you this \u2014 very important \u2014 you are hereby unconditionally pardoned,\u201d Trump said. He reached over to run his hand over the feathers, saying, \u201cWho would want to harm this beautiful bird?\u201d",

      "An organization is tracking the growing number of arrests among people with temporary deportation protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program",
      "McALLEN, Texas -- Yaakub Vijandre was preparing to go to work as a mechanic when six vehicles appeared outside his Dallas-area home. Federal agents jumped out, one pointed a weapon at him, and they took him into custody.",
      "Vijandre is a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that has shielded hundreds of thousands of people from deportation since 2012 if they were brought to the United States as children and generally stayed out of trouble. The Trump administration said it targeted Vijandre over social media posts. The freelance videographer and pro-Palestinian activist described his early October arrest to his attorneys, who relayed the information to reporters.",
      "His arrest and several others this year signal a change in how the U.S. is handling DACA recipients as President Donald Trump's administration reshapes immigration policy more broadly. The change comes as immigrants have face increased vetting, including of their social media, when they apply for visas, green cards, citizenship, or to request the release of their children from federal custody. The administration also has sought to deport foreign students for participating in pro-Palestinian activism.",
      "DACA was created to shield recipients, commonly referred to as \u201cDreamers,\u201d from immigration arrests and deportation. It also allows them to legally work in the U.S. Recipients reapply every two years. Previously if their status was in jeopardy, they would receive a warning and would still have a chance to fight it before immigration officers detained them and began efforts to deport them.",
      "In response to questions about any changes, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement saying that people \u201cwho claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportations. DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.\u201d DACA recipients can lose status \u201cfor a number of reasons, including if they\u2019ve committed a crime,\u201d she said.",
      "McLaughlin also claimed in a statement that Vijandre made social media posts \u201cglorifying terrorism,\u201d including one she said celebrated Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaida\u2019s leader in Iraq who was killed in a U.S. strike in 2006.",
      "An attorney for Vijandre, Chris Godshall-Bennett, said Vijandre\u2019s social media activity is \u201cclearly\u201d protected speech. He also said the government has not provided details about the specific posts in court documents.",
      "Vijandre is among about 20 DACA recipients who have been arrested or detained by immigration authorities since Trump took office in January, according to Home is Here, a campaign created by pro-DACA advocacy groups. The administration is seeking to end his DACA status, which could result in him being deported to the Philippines, a home he has not visited since his family came to the U.S. in 2001, when he was 14.",
      "DACA survived the first Trump administration\u2019s attempt to rescind the program when the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that the administration did not take the proper steps to end it.",
      "There have been other attempts to end the program or place restrictions on recipients.",
      "This year, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that would deny work permits for DACA recipients who live in Texas. The Trump administration recently presented its plans to a federal judge who is determining how it will work.",
      "The administration also has issued new restrictions on commercial driver\u2019s licenses that would prevent DACA recipients and some other immigrants from getting them. Last year, 19 Republican states stripped DACA recipients' access to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. And the number of states where immigrant students can qualify for in-state tuition has dwindled since the Justice Department began suing states this year.",

      "U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll has become a key negotiator in the Trump administration\u2019s push to end the Russia-Ukraine war",
      "WASHINGTON -- In a matter of days, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll vaulted from being the leader of a military bureaucracy \u2014 where he's been cutting red tape to quickly buy inexpensive drones \u2014 to a key negotiator in the Trump administration's push to end the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The boyish Iraq War veteran, former venture capitalist and friend of Vice President JD Vance went from presenting President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv to sitting down with Russian officials in the United Arab Emirates on Monday and Tuesday, heading up the latest phase of talks on a possible deal to halt the fighting.",
      "Trump appears to believe Driscoll's efforts are going well, posting on social media that \u201cmy team has made tremendous progress.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the hopes of finalizing this Peace Plan,\" Trump wrote Tuesday, \u201cI have directed my Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with President Putin in Moscow and, at the same time, Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll will be meeting with the Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "It's an unlikely assignment for the Army's top civilian leader, who got the job in February at age 38. His Senate confirmation hearing focused on how the Army could modernize its systems, improve recruiting and beef up the military industrial base, not international diplomacy.",
      "Driscoll only learned of his new role as a negotiator about a week before he was sitting across the table from Zelenskyy, a U.S. official said.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive plans, said Driscoll always had planned to visit Ukraine but the trip was aimed at learning more about how its military has been using drones in warfare, not to negotiate peace.",
      "The official said after Driscoll was named as a special representative by the White House, he first traveled to Europe for briefings before heading to Ukraine.",
      "There, Driscoll clasped hands with Zelenskyy and expressed admiration for Ukrainian soldiers, saying that even the most combat-hardened American troops \u201cnever had to defend their homeland.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we the Army look and see how well you guys have done, it\u2019s remarkable,\u201d Driscoll told Zelenskyy last week. The Ukrainian leader said he spoke for almost an hour Friday with Vance and Driscoll about the proposal.",
      "Driscoll\u2019s performance in Ukraine seems to have paid off, because from there, he joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff and other top negotiators in Geneva to discuss changes to the plan with the Ukrainians before traveling to Abu Dhabi to negotiate with the Russians. The negotiations with Moscow were only a possibility just a week prior, the official said.",
      "Some experts say his role in the negotiations is an out-of-the-box move by the Trump administration that may or may not pay off.",
      "\u201cI think what is helpful from this administration is its willingness to throw out ideas and try things,\u201d said Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But he added, \u201cI had not heard of Dan Driscoll, to be frank, in Ukraine-Russia conversations at all.\u201d",
      "Driscoll's value is his connection to the vice president, Bergmann said. Driscoll has known Vance since law school at Yale University and previously served as Vance's adviser, giving the Army secretary a direct line to the Trump administration \u2014 and more leverage \u2014 during negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere is something to be said about having someone who is probably texting with the vice president and therefore has that political juice,\u201d said Bergmann, who served in State Department positions during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.",

      "The film explores the mystery of who killed Mr. Boddy, who had been blackmailing his dinner party guests. Warren is among the film's ensemble cast that includes Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Eileen Brennan, Christopher Lloyd, Martin Mull, Michael McKean and Colleen Camp.",
      "Miss Scarlett is a sultry Washington, D.C., madam who collects secrets on the city's elite.",
      "\"What I love about Miss Scarlett, she takes no s***,\" Warren said. \"It was a great chance to kind of explore all of that behavior.\"",
      "Camp plays Yvette, the maid, an informant for Miss Scarlet.",
      "\"It was fun, a good time,\" Camp said about being part of the ensemble. \"We would watch each other in the scenes. We'd applaud each other. We were a real family.\"",
      "The movie embraces a campy feel, relying on one-liners and quick banter throughout. It features three endings, each with a different outcome about the murder mystery.",
      "The cast didn't learn about the multiple endings until filming was close to wrapping, creating suspense among the actors themselves.",
      "Mixed reviews and renewed popularity",
      "In his original critique of the film, Roger Ebert wrote, \"Fun, I must say, is in short supply.\"",
      "But about a decade after the release of \"Clue,\" a new popularity emerged thanks in part to cable television and eventually streaming services.",
      "\"Martin Mull called me on the phone and said, 'Are you getting a lot of fan mail from 'Clue,' like a crazy amount of fan mail?'\" Warren said. \"And I was like, 'Yes, what's going on?'\"",
      "Camp also noticed renewed attention, saying, \"it was years later where all of a sudden, I would hear people react to this movie and they were obsessed with it.\"",
      "The cult following has led to spoofs. Some cast members also attend special screenings to meet fans.",
      "For Warren, who just finished the first leg of a nationwide tour and hits the road again in January, the legacy of \"Clue\" is bringing people joy.",
      "\"It makes them laugh,\" she said. \"They love the suspense and I think it's just created a life that lives now on its own.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 08:51:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Jimmy Cliff, who famously sang about the \"many rivers\" we all must cross, has died after suffering a seizure and pneumonia, his family say.",
    "story": [
      "Reggae music icon Jimmy Cliff, who's unique tone, lyricism and breakthrough role on the silver screen helped make the music of his native Jamaica part of popular culture across the globe, has died at the age of 81, his family said in a statement shared Monday on social media.",
      "\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" Latifa Chambers said in a statement posted on Cliff's Instagram account. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career \u2026 Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\"",
      "The couple's children Lilty and Aken also signed the statement.",
      "Cliff was one of Jamaican music's early international stars, emerging as reggae evolved from the sounds of ska and rocksteady in the 1960s and early 1970s. His starring role in the enduring classic movie \"The Harder They Come,\" an entirely Jamaican production, in 1972 cemented his legacy as not only a musician, but a cultural phenom.",
      "Cliff played Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin,  an aspiring singer who came up against the harsh realities of a music business run by self-interested producers, at the expense of artists, and the abundant traps for young Jamaicans trying to survive amid an epidemic of violent gang crime that swept the nation.",
      "\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety magazine in a 2022 interview to mark the 50th anniversary of the movie's release. \"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. However, being a hero was the manner in which [director] Perry [Henzel] wanted to make his name \u2014 an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"",
      "The messages in the movie, just like his music, were timeless.",
      "The title track from \"The Harder They Come,\" along with familiar hits including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" spoke to the struggles of Jamaicans at the time, but they have continued to resonate with audiences around the world since he wrote them.",
      "Cliff, along with other icons such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert helped give the music and culture of their relatively small Caribbean nation a global impact that endures today, and far exceeds Jamaica's size in terms of population economy.",
      "His animated onstage presence and high-pitched tone were unmistakable. Cliff released his last single, \"Human Touch,\"   only four years ago. According to The Associated Press, Cliff was nominated for Grammy awards seven times and he won twice, taking best reggae album in 1986 with \"Cliff Hanger,\" and again in 2012 with \"Rebirth.\"",
      "In a tribute posted on his own social media accounts early Monday morning, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called Cliff \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world.\"",
      "\"Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul,\" Holness said. \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.  We give thanks for his life, his contribution, and the pride he brought to Jamaica ... Walk good, Jimmy Cliff. Your legacy lives on in every corner of our island and in the hearts of the Jamaican people.\"",

    "summary": "Lea Michele, the \"Glee\" star who made her Broadway debut in \"Les Miserables\" at age eight, is now back in the same Broadway theater starring in \"Chess: The Musical.\"",
    "story": [
      "In 1965, the original musical \"Funny Girl\" was playing at Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre, starring someone who knew her way around a song. That same year, a guy named Joe Allen opened a place a few blocks away. It was the place to be for Broadway stars like Al Pacino and a host of others. Plus, they served a mean cheeseburger.",
      "The cheeseburgers are still there, and so are Broadway's elite. Lea Michele has been coming here since her Broadway debut in the 1990s. \"I just love this place so much,\" she said.",
      "And what would she eat? \"A burger. I mean, it's always so good, so good here, oh my God,\" she said.",
      "But when we met her at Joe Allen's, she wasn't in a burger mood, because she had a show to do. Lea Michele is currently starring in the musical \"Chess.\" In the show, she plays a brilliant strategist for two world champion chess players (played by Aaron Tveit and Nicholas Christopher).",
      "\"Chess\" is a love triangle, a spectacle, and a chance for the stars to raise the roof at the Imperial Theatre \u2013 the same place where Michele made her Broadway debut in 1995 in \"Les Miserables,\" at the age of eight.",
      "Her parents weren't show biz people \u2013 Dad owned a deli \u2013 and before she auditioned, they had no clue their daughter could sing. \"And as we were leaving, I turned to my Mom and I was like, 'I'm gonna get this. I think I'm gonna get this,'\" Michele recalled. \"And she said, 'Things like that don't happen to people like us.'\"",
      "In this case, Mom was wrong: Michele got the part, and went on to even greater heights in the musical \"Spring Awakening,\" and later became a household name in the hit TV show \"Glee.\"",
      "She hit a few bumps along the way, among them a difficult pregnancy with her first child in 2020, and flak on social media that she acted like a diva back in the \"Glee\" days. But things looked up in 2023, when she was asked to step into the shoes of her idol Barbra Streisand, and take over a struggling revival of \"Funny Girl.\"",
      "She said, \"I think that we all grow as we get older. It's hard being in an industry where there is such a spotlight on these phases and times in your life.\"",
      "And what was the pressure like to take over \"Funny Girl\"? It was the first time that I was really sort of in the spotlight after everything that had happened to me personally,\" Michele said. \"I wanted to finally show everyone that I could play this part, and play her really well.\"",
      "Long story short, Michele killed it, and turned a sinking show into a hit, despite suffering a miscarriage during her run. And when she was approached about doing \"Chess,\" she told producers that having another baby came first.\u00a0 \"And so my husband and I ended up doing IVF, which was in its own right very intense and challenging,\" she said. \"But you know, we got pregnant and had our daughter, who is wonderful and wild. And then they, you know, said, 'Would you like to do the show?' 'Absolutely!'\"",
      "Now, the 39-year-old mother of two is back at the Imperial Theatre, where it all began, serving up another knockout performance with a side of gratitude.",
      "I asked, \"What do you think that eight-year-old girl would think, back in that same theatre?\"",
      "\"I think that she'd be so proud, and she would just say, 'Thank you,' 'cause that's all she wanted,\" Michele said. \"And it's still what I want. My love for what I do was definitely reignited during 'Funny Girl.' And I'm very grateful for that. But I'm so happy to be here, and to be home.\"",

    "summary": "Rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to the 2012 Obama campaign.",
    "story": [
      "Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.",
      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.",

    "story": [
      "As an artist, Lily Allen stands firm by her belief that heartbreak can be a gift. After all, it helped lead to her latest album, \"West End Girl.\"",
      "\"You know, while I was writing it, I wasn't really sure that it was going to see the light of day,\" Allen told CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason in an interview for \"CBS Mornings\" that aired Thursday, describing the music as \"an act of desperation.\" The studio album, released in late October, was written during the breakup of her nearly 4-year marriage to \"Stranger Things\" actor David Harbour.",
      "The theme of what's been described as Allen's epic \"breakup album\" centers around tales of a deceptive partner, which the singer says is based partly on truth and partly on fantasy.",
      "Harbour has not directly addressed his breakup with Allen or commented on her \"West End Girl\" album. But in an interview with Esquire UK, published around the album's release, Harbour discussed the importance of accepting your mistakes. \"I'd change everything or nothing. If you accept your past, you accept it completely, even the pain, the mistakes... It's all part of the journey, the growth, the wisdom, the empathy, and the connection, and if you change one thing, you change everything,\" he told the magazine at the time, adding that his work is about being honest.",
      "New album says \"everything that I needed to say\"",
      "But Allen said it was a \"nightmare\" holding onto the album and stunted her healing process. She felt a sense of relief and peace when she finally was able to share her words with the world.",
      "\"Since I've put it out, it's felt completely and utterly liberating. It was kind of hellish having it in the background,\" Allen said. \"I don't know. I just feel like I couldn't \u2013 it said everything that I needed to say. And I felt like I couldn't really like get on with my life until I'd said it.\"",
      "Her newly released music quickly lit up social media, with fans reacting to it on TikTok.",
      "Allen wrote most of the record within the span of 10 days at the end of last year. She was excited to complete the album, but at the same time her personal life was falling into pieces.",
      "After spending Christmas with her two daughters whom she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper, Allen decided to check herself into a treatment facility.",
      "\"I knew the things I was feeling were too intense,\" Allen explained her decision to seek professional help at the time following her separation. As a recovering alcoholic, Allen said she's not afraid of working on herself and knew she needed some quiet time.",
      "A cathartic release",
      "The Brooklyn townhouse that Allen and Harbour gave Architectural Digest a tour of in 2023 is now listed for around $8 million. The pair bought the home in early 2021 shortly after they got married.",
      "Allen said her music was cathartic \u2013 for herself and her children.",
      "\"All of the pain that, you know, that I've been through in the past year, they've been through too,\" Allen said. \" But you know, one thing that I wanted to do was to show my kids that, you know, you can use that pain and harness it and turn it into something else. And I think I've done that.\"",
      "Now, Allen is preparing for her 2026 tour \u2013 her first since she got sober in 2019.",
      "The singer said she's planning her touring schedule around her girls' holidays so they'll be able to come and bring their friends.",
      "\"I can't wait to have them there. It's like, it's gonna be... It's as much for them as it is for me,\" Allen said, adding that she feels like she's living her best life after a year of healing.",

      "In a Nov. 24 update posted on the company's website, ByHeart said that five of 36 samples tested positive for Clostridium botulinum Type A, the bacteria that can cause the potentially deadly illness.",
      "\"Based on these results, we cannot rule out the risk that all ByHeart formula across all product lots may have been contaminated,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "As of Nov. 19, at least 31 cases of reported infant botulism in 15 states have been tied to various shipments of the ByHeart Whole Nutrition infant formula, according to the FDA. No deaths have been reported.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 11:18:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Aviation experts worry that the recent government shutdown could make it hard for the U.S. to recruit a new generation of air traffic controllers.",
    "story": [
      "The government shutdown highlighted a fragile link in the nation's aviation system: finding enough air traffic controllers to keep flights on schedule. The 43-day closure, during which controllers were required to work without pay, has only heightened that challenge.",
      "\"It's a good job with good benefits, but partisan fighting over appropriations is not an ideal situation to try to bring in new air traffic controllers and convince them that this is a good career field,\" Tim Kiefer, a retired air traffic controller who is now a professor of air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told CBS News. \"It's not a positive to try to bring people into this industry by saying, 'You never know if you're not going to get paid.'\"",
      "The shutdown saw a spike in the number of controllers choosing to retire, according to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. The spectacle could also scare away younger workers from entering the field, Kiefer said.",
      "\"If you are a brand new person looking to enter a career, you may be thinking twice if you have to worry whether you're going to be paid or not. That may be a deterrent, and they might find another job because of that,\" he added.",
      "A spokesperson from the Department of Transportation told CBS News that \"the failure to pay air traffic controllers for 44 days created uncertainty, drove many experienced controllers out of the profession and harmed the recruitment pipeline.\"",
      "\"No one wants to enter a job where their paycheck could be held hostage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. had roughly\u00a011,700\u00a0certified professional controllers and certified controllers in training, leaving the nation some 4,000 short of the FAA's target staffing level. The agency expects to hire at least 8,900 new air traffic controllers through 2028, while nearly 7,000 are projected to leave over the same period.",
      "The FAA hit its hiring target in 2025, bringing in 2,026 new air traffic controllers, according to the agency.",
      "\"This administration is working all avenues from increasing starting salaries for controllers to streamlining the hiring process to effectively bring about the Golden Age of Travel and ensure America has the safest airspace in the world,\" the Transportation Department spokesperson said.",
      "What are the qualifications?",
      "On the FAA's website, Duffy describes controlling air traffic as \"one of the best, most rewarding \u00a0jobs in America.\" He also highlighted \"the urgent need to do all that we can to recruit more people to join in our shared mission of safety in our skies.\"",
      "Recruiting prospective air traffic controllers is one thing, but getting them to stick with the roughly four years of training required to be certified by the FAA is another matter, according to industry experts.",
      "\"The washout rate at various stages of the controller recruitment and training process is high,\" Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a group promoting libertarian principles, told CBS News.",
      "Before someone qualifies to train at the FAA's Air Traffic Controller Academy in Oklahoma City, Okla., job candidates must undergo a rigorous application process. To even apply through USAJobs, the federal government's official employment site, they must meet the following criteria:",
      "Be a U.S. citizenBe under the age of 31Pass the FAA air traffic pre-employment tests, including the Air Traffic Controller Specialists Skills Assessment Battery (ATSA)Speak English clearly enough to be understood over communications equipmentHave one year of progressively responsible work experience, or a Bachelor's degree, or a combination of at least one year of post-secondary education and work experience",
      "Be a U.S. citizen",
      "Be under the age of 31",
      "Pass the FAA air traffic pre-employment tests, including the Air Traffic Controller Specialists Skills Assessment Battery (ATSA)",
      "Speak English clearly enough to be understood over communications equipment",
      "Have one year of progressively responsible work experience, or a Bachelor's degree, or a combination of at least one year of post-secondary education and work experience",
      "Aspiring controllers must also pass an exam that the FAA\u00a0says\u00a0predicts candidates' \"aptitude to be an air traffic controller.\" Within a week, they are notified if they have passed.",
      "Stephen Abraham, a retired air traffic controller formerly based at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, told CBS News that the aptitude exam weeds out many job candidates.",
      "\"It's an assessment that determines if you have the right mental makeup to be an air traffic controller,\" he said, noting that people can not prepare or study for the test. \"If you succeed, they send you to Oklahoma City for eight to 12 weeks, where your training is more tailored toward success.\"",
      "Candidates who pass the test must then undergo comprehensive medical and background checks before they begin training at the academy. The medical red flags include using certain types of contact lenses to correct their vision, which is automatically disqualifying, and abnormal blood pressure.",
      "According to the FAA, fewer than 10% of applicants meet the agency's requirements to work as an air traffic controller and gain admission to the training program.",
      "How much do controllers earn?",
      "Once enrolled at the Oklahoma City academy, students spend months learning the basics of controlling the nation's airspace, such as understanding where to position planes on tabletop models of airports, Abraham explained. As they progress, they start using simulators to practice managing air traffic.",
      "Other training focuses on how to communicate with pilots and other controllers assigned to different parts of the airspace, as well as how to determine the best flight routes based on changing weather conditions and other factors.",
      "In time, trainees are assigned to an air traffic control facility, typically a control tower at a small airport with lighter plane traffic, where they spend an additional two to four years working as controllers under the supervision of more experienced staff.",
      "Joining the FAA academy isn't the only path to becoming a controller. Candidates can instead attend a college that offers an FAA-certified curriculum, and then proceed directly to on-the-job training.",
      "In 2024 (the last year for which federal data is available), the median annual wage for air traffic controllers was $144,580, according\u00a0to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "But pay varies widely based on experience and location. Annual income for less experienced controllers at smaller airports is closer to $60,000, according to aviation experts. Abraham said controllers' pay can rise as they rise to working at busier facilities, gain experience and get promoted.",
      "\"A lot of people get to that point, and when they are at their first facility, trying to learn to control real traffic, some just don't make it,\" Poole said. \"It's more stressful than being a pilot, who flies a route from point A to B mostly on autopilot.\"",

According to the lawsuit, Bally made several comments about Indian workers and said that Campbell's is \"highly [processed] food\" for \"poor people.\"",
      "Garza said he informed his manager, J.D. Aupperle, about the comments on Jan. 10 and claims Aupperle did not encourage him to report the incident to human resources.",
      "Garza was then \"abruptly terminated from employment\" just weeks later, the lawsuit says. The discussion between Garza and Bally was recorded, according to Detroit television station WDIV.",
      "James Regan, a Campbell's spokesperson, said the company was not aware of the recording before it aired on WDIV on Thursday and doesn't know if it's legitimate.",
      "Bally is one of many vice presidents at Campbell's, according to Regan. His\u00a0LinkedIn lists his title as vice president and chief information security officer.",
      "\"The person alleged to be speaking on the recording works in IT and has nothing to do with how we make our food,\" Campbell's said in a statement to CBS News. The company also said Bally is temporarily on leave while the company conducts an investigation.",
      "\"If the comments were in fact made, they are unacceptable,\" the company said. \"The comments heard on the recording about our food are not only inaccurate \u2014 they are patently absurd.\"",
      "Campbell's also defended the quality of its products, noting the company uses \"100% real chicken in our soups.\"",
      "A factsheet published Tuesday on Campbell's website notes that the company does not use \"3D-printed chicken, lab-grown chicken, or any form of artificial or bioengineered meat\" in their soups.",
      "\"The chicken meat used in Campbell's soups comes from long-trusted, USDA-approved U.S. suppliers,\" the factsheet says.",
      "On Monday, James Uthmeier, the Attorney General of Florida, said\u00a0in a social media post that the state's Consumer Protection division is investigating the quality of Campbell's products.",
      "Garza's lawsuit alleges he suffered stress, humiliation, embarrassment and mental anguish as a result of Bally and Aupperle's actions. He is seeking compensation for emotional, reputational and economic harm, as well as attorneys' fees, according to the complaint.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:49:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Past-due balances are becoming a reality for many U.S. households as they struggle to keep up with costlier utility bills.",
    "story": [
      "Americans' energy bills are piling up, forcing them deeper into debt and even triggering power shutoffs.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 households went into collections or fell in arrears on their utility bills, according to a new\u00a0joint report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The problem was even more pronounced in parts of the South and Appalachia, where one in 12 households was already in collections or on the verge of it.",
      "In the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the report found.",
      "More Americans are falling behind on their utility payments due to\u00a0rising energy prices, alongside a jump in costs for other essentials, ranging from child care to housing.",
      "\"When we see families unable to pay their utility bills, it raises alarm bells about a crisis of home heating and electricity, but it also raises alarm bells about people's ability to deal with their cost of living across the board,\" said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation.",
      "Residential electricity prices rose by 10.5% between January and August 2025, one of the fastest increases in a decade, government data analyzed by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), an educational and policy organization, shows. Natural gas is still the most popular way Americans heat their homes, although a growing\u00a0share are using electricity.",
      "A combination of high interest rates, rising natural gas costs and an increase in demand from data centers has pushed up prices, according to NEADA.",
      "The issue will likely come into sharper focus this winter when millions of consumers face heating bills. NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.",
      "More Americans at risk of shutoffs",
      "When people fail to pay their energy bills on time, it can lead to electricity shutoffs, or when a utility turns off a household's power until people pay the balance, along with a so-called reconnection fee.",
      "Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all. States without cold-weather protection include Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, according to the Energy Justice Lab, a joint project of Indiana University and the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Despite these protections, Americans are becoming increasingly vulnerable to shutoffs, experts told CBS News.",
      "While no official national count of utility cutoffs exists, NEADA estimates that 3.5 million American households had their power cut off at some point in 2024 based on public data reported by utility companies. That number is expected to swell to 4 million this year, NEADA estimates.",
      "\"Past due balances climbing, particularly for lower-income families, suggest that shutoffs are going to become much more prevalent,\" the Century Foundation's Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Con Edison, a utility serving New York City and Westchester County in New York, has cut off almost 168,000 customers at some point this year, according to data NEADA shared with CBS News. That's more than five times the number of shutoffs the utility reported last year.",
      "Most Americans whose power is cut off have services restored within a few days, according to Mark Wolfe, NEADA's executive director. Still, the shutoffs can create major disruptions to Americans' day-to-day lives as they lose refrigeration, internet and lighting. Pipes can also freeze, and residents could get sick if their apartments get too cold, Wolfe added.",
      "Shutoffs tend to have a bigger impact on low-income households, given they are already stretched thin by everyday expenses, Wolfe said. Many turn to payday lenders, friends and family or state forgiveness plans to cover reconnection costs or overdue bills, he added.",
      "\"When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,\" Wolfe told CBS News. \"That flexibility gives them a small sense of control, but it also increases the risk of falling behind and facing shutoffs.\"",

    "summary": "The impact of the Republicans' tax and spending law could result in the \"largest refund season of the last decade,\" a Wall Street report says.",
    "story": [
      "Federal tax refunds often represent a family's single largest check of the year, and next year's refunds could be even bigger, with the average payment set to increase by about $1,000 per filer, according to a recent analysis from financial services company Piper Sandler.",
      "That could boost the typical refund check to roughly $4,151 per filer, based on IRS data that shows the average tax refund was $3,151 for the 2025 tax filing season. Americans will file their 2025 individual returns in early 2026, with most people receiving their refunds within 21 days of submitting their forms to the tax agency.",
      "The analysis aligns with other forecasts predicting a bumper year for tax refunds, driven by the \"one big, beautiful\" tax and spending law signed by President Trump in July. The legislation enacted a bevy of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025, including eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, as well as lifting the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "\"When people go to file, they'll be surprised by really, really large refunds,\" Don Schneider, deputy head of U.S. policy at Piper Sandler and one of the report's authors, said in a recent podcast about the analysis. \"In a typical year, we might have about $270 billion in tax refunds, and it'll be that plus another $90 billion.\"",
      "Americans generally aren't adjusting their withholding to reflect the new law's retroactive tax cuts, largely because it's hard for employees to estimate the impact, Schneider added. As a result, when people file their taxes in early 2026, their refunds could be about one-third larger than usual \u2014 that amounts to roughly an extra $1,000 per filer, according to the report's calculations.",
      "\"It could be one of the largest tax refund seasons ever,\" Schneider added.",
      "Still, the impact won't be evenly distributed, with the benefits largely going toward middle- and upper-middle-income households, or those earning between $60,000 to $400,000 per year, according to Piper Sandler.",
      "That echoes earlier tax analyses projecting that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. People who earn over $217,000 a year are likely to get $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the law, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Some of the law's benefits won't reach the highest-earning households because of income phase-outs, Piper Sandler noted. For example, the new $40,000 SALT deduction begins to phase out for filers with annual income of more than $500,000.",
      "The lowest-earning households are also likely to see little benefit from parts of the new tax law. For instance, the higher SALT deduction cap only helps people whose state and local taxes exceed the 2025 standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples.",
      "Because filers must itemize to claim the SALT deduction, lower-income households typically can't take advantage of it, according to tax experts.",
      "\"This isn't going to the very bottom of the distribution. It isn't going to the very top of the distribution either,\" Scheider said.",

      "A previously unknown work by French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir of his toddler son Jean sold for $2.08 million (1.8 million euros) at a Paris auction on Tuesday, the Drouot auction house told AFP.",

      "It belonged to Jean's godmother, Jeanne Baudot, a friend and student of Renoir's, who passed the painting on to her heirs.",
      "Believed to have been painted between 1890 and 1895, it features the artist's second son, who went on to become an Oscar-winning filmmaker, shown sitting with his nanny.",
      "Pascal Perrin, an art historian and Renoir expert, lauded the \"exceptional condition of the work, which has undergone no restoration,\" while presenting the canvas.",
      "\"We were particularly surprised by how fresh the painting was,\" Perrin told PBS earlier this month. \"In other words, it is a painting that has retained all of its colors perfectly, which has not been recanvassed, retouched or revarnished.\"",
      "Jean Renoir, born in 1894, went on to receive a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award in 1975, several years before he died at the age of 84. His works include the 1930s classic \"La Grande Illusion,\" which follows two French prisoners of war trying to escape German captivity during World War I.",
      "The painting of him as a child had been valued at 1-1.5 million euros and was acquired by an \"international buyer,\" Drouot said on Tuesday.",
      "\"It is exceptional because, first of all, it is a masterclass of intimacy,\" auctioneer Christophe Joron-Derem told PBS. \"We see this very tender relationship between Jean and Gabrielle, who knows how to control the child so that Renoir can paint him.\"",
      "The high-end art market has dipped in recent years, but lately, record-breaking sales have indicated a revival in demand.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nursing-professional-degree-excluded-list/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:40:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Nursing advocates say a proposed rule could worsen a shortage of professionals in the field and lead to worse health outcomes.",
    "story": [
      "A proposal from the Trump administration would exclude nursing from a list of professional degrees, a move that has drawn outcry from nursing advocates, who warn it could worsen the nation's nurse shortage by limiting how much students can borrow for their training.",
      "The change stems from changes authorized by the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act, which introduced a new cap on borrowing for higher education. Starting July 1, 2026, students enrolled in professional degree programs will be restricted to borrowing $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap.",
      "Students in graduate programs that aren't deemed professional will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Nursing professionals say they're alarmed by the proposed rule's definition of what constitutes a professional degree, which lists some medical fields, including pharmacy, dentistry and medical doctors, but doesn't include nursing. Capping loans for nursing students could ultimately restrict students' access to enrolling in degree programs at a time when the industry is already grappling with a shortage of nurses, they say.",
      "The proposal would create \"obstacles for students who want to pursue advanced degrees, which would most likely lead to decreased students pursuing degrees in nursing,\" Kim Litwack, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Nursing, told CBS News. \"That means there will be less of these professionals joining the workforce.\"",
      "In a statement issued earlier this month, the Education Department said the proposal creates a new definition of a professional student to determine who qualifies for the higher loan limits.",
      "The goal of the changes, including the new loan caps, is to ensure that borrowers won't face \"insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off,\" said Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent in the statement.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the Education Department said 95% of nursing students won't be impacted by the borrowing cap.",
      "\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" said Ellen Keast, the press secretary for higher education at the agency. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",
      "What's a professional degree?",
      "Under the Education Department's proposal, a professional degree is one that \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession, and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"",
      "The department also said in a\u00a0fact sheet that its definition of a professional degree is used to distinguish programs that qualify for higher loan limits from one another, and is \"not a value judgement about the importance of programs.\"",
      "The programs that it defines as professional include: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology. Students in degree programs that aren't considered professional \u2014 such as those in nursing, physical therapy and physician assistant degrees \u2014 would have lower loan caps under the proposed rule.",
      "Other groups representing professions that were excluded under the proposal also issued objections, such as the Council on Social Work Education, which said it was \"disheartened and concerned.\" The American Academy of Audiology pointed out that audiology isn't included, which it said could discourage students from pursuing careers in the field.",
      "Nursing's exclusion from the list of professional degree programs \"makes no sense,\" said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association.",
      "In addition to lowering the loan cap, the \"big, beautiful bill\" law also eliminates the Grad PLUS program that allows graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of obtaining a degree.",
      "Kennedy and other nursing industry advocates who disagree with the omission of nursing as a professional degree are hopeful the proposal could be changed before it's adopted.",
      "\"It feels like a miscommunication, and we hope the Department of Education changes the proposed language before the rule comes out for public comment. They did add professions to the list before it was released, so they could have added nurses, which clearly belong,\" she said.",
      "The Education Department said the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, although it didn't specify a date, and will be open for public comment.",
      "\"A real gut punch\"",
      "Olga Yakusheva, an economist and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, said limiting how much money nursing students can borrow could curb entry into the field.",
      "\"It's going to limit the ability of nurses to apply for graduate school, and on the back end, it will limit the number of nurses available in primary care settings and in hospitals,\" she said. \"Communities with shortages of physicians will feel this the most.\"",
      "Patricia Pittman, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, said nurses fill critical medical care gaps in rural communities. The rule could create financial barriers that she says would disincentivize nurses from seeking advanced licensing, which ultimately could harm rural areas.",
      "\"Basically, nobody would be there if it weren't for these nurse practitioners,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Pittman also says it will have a negative effect on morale within the nursing profession.",
      "\"It's a real gut punch, and the result nurses are going to be angry about this,\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 09:25:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Criminals are targeting shoppers with fake websites, bogus charities and other fraudulent pitches, according to insights from Visa.",
    "story": [
      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",
      "Edited by\n                                        \n                                  Aimee  Picchi",

      "Bystanders couldn't open the doors because the handles do not work from the outside because they also rely on battery power to operate.. The doors also couldn't be opened from inside because the battery had shut off because of the fire, and a manual override button is hard to find and use, the lawsuit alleges.",

      "Some batteries that power a popular brand of e-bike pose a fire hazard that can cause serious injury or death and shouldn't be used, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said in a\u00a0notice Monday.",
      "The commission is warning customers to immediately stop using lithium-ion batteries that power e-bikes made by Seattle, Washington-based Rad Power Bikes. The batteries can ignite and explode, causing serious injury or death, the agency warned.",
      "Rad Power Bikes said it disagreed with the agency's warning.",
      "\"Rad Power Bikes firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC's characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe,\" a Rad spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The batteries that pose a fire hazard are model numbers are RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304, according to the CPSC. They are particularly vulnerable to catching fire when they are exposed to water and also to what the commission describes as \"debris.\"",
      "CPSC said it has received 31 reports of the batteries causing fires, including 12 reports of fires that caused property damage. Cumulatively, accidents related to the batteries have caused roughly $734,500 in property damage, it said, adding that some of the incidents took place when a battery was neither charging nor in use.",
      "CPSC is urging consumers to immediately stop using the batteries, which it said should be removed from the e-bikes and disposed of in accordance with local disposal procedures. It added that Rad Power Bikes has not agreed to recall the products.",

      "The U.S. stock market rose on Monday, spurred by a jump in tech stocks and renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve may slash its benchmark interest rate at its December meeting.",
      "The S&P 500 climbed 108 points, or 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 294 points, or 0.6%, as of 2:10 p.m. EDT. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 2.7%.",
      "Companies with investments in artificial intelligence saw gains on Monday. Alphabet, which has been getting praise for its newest Gemini AI model, rallied 5.5% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. The jump in tech stocks comes as investors continue to assess the potential of AI-focused businesses, even as questions remain about\u00a0whether an AI bubble is forming.",
      "AI chipmaker Nvidia gained 2.1%.",
      "Stocks also rose on renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates for a third straight time at its Dec. 10 meeting. Traders now place the likelihood of a rate cut around nearly 80%, up from 41% on Thursday, according to data from CME FedWatch.",
      "But Monday's gains were hesitant, and the S&P 500 rallied to a gain of 1% only to halve it within the first 15 minutes of trading, before picking up momentum again.",
      "Stocks have been swinging sharply, not just day to day but also hour to hour, in recent weeks as worries weigh about what the Fed will do with interest rates and whether too much money is pouring into AI and creating a bubble. All the uncertainty is creating the biggest test for investors since an April sell-off, when President Donald Trump shocked the world with his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",

      "Economists expect the data to show a 2.6% rise from a year earlier, the same inflation rate as August. A higher-than-expected reading could deter the Fed from cutting its main interest rate in December because lower rates can worsen inflation. Some Fed officials have already argued against a December cut in part because inflation has stubbornly remained  above their 2% target.",

    "summary": "A higher Medicare Part B premium in 2026 could erode next year's cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security recipients, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "A higher Medicare premium set to go into effect in 2026 will push the monthly charge above $200 for the first time, with the increase likely to erode next year's cost-of-living increase for millions of Social Security recipients.",
      "The premium for Medicare's Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services, will rise 9.7% to $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from the current $185 monthly cost, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0said earlier this month. It's the largest increase since 2022, when the Part B premium jumped 15%.",
      "The Part B deductible \u2014 the amount seniors must pay out of pocket before their coverage kicks in\u2014 is also rising about 10%, jumping to $283 next year from this year's $257.",
      "The Part B premium, which is deducted automatically from seniors' monthly Social Security checks, is rising at a rate that's three times that of inflation, partly due to a rise in underlying health care costs, Anne Montgomery, senior health policy expert at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM), said in a\u00a0blog\u00a0post. The Medicare premium increase means that seniors may not have much room to keep up with inflation, Max Richtman, the president and CEO of the same group, told CBS News.",
      "\"So many rely on [Social Security] for all or most of their income,\" he said. \"This is gonna hurt.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration set next year's cost-of-living increase at 2.8%, which will boost the average Social Security paycheck by $56 to about $2,071 per month.",
      "The Medicare Part B premium hike will consume about a third of next year's COLA, effectively lowering the rate to 1.9% \u2014 far below the current inflation rate of 3%, according to NCPSSM's analysis. People with lower monthly benefits could even see an effective COLA of zero, the group said.",
      "Rising health care costs",
      "Health care costs have been rising for all Americans, contributing to the sticker shock that seniors and other groups are experiencing. In 2023, Americans spent an average of $1,514 on out-of-pocket health care costs, an increase of 9% from 2020 on an inflation-adjusted basis, according to KFF.",
      "Aside from underlying health care inflation, Medicare's costs are also increasing because of increased demand for medical services, CMS said this month.",
      "Working adults will also face higher health care premiums in 2026. Roughly 22 million Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces will also be faced with steep rate hikes if Congress fails to extend premium tax credits, which help lower the cost for the majority of people on ACA plans.",
      "Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025, which became the main sticking point in the recent government shutdown. Without an extension, Americans who rely on the tax credit could see their costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",

    "summary": "Those prioritizing economy say Trump is not spending enough time on it, as ratings of economy, his handling of inflation slip.",
    "story": [
      "The situation around Venezuela has Americans asking to know more.",
      "Across party lines, big majorities say the administration needs to explain what the U.S. intends regarding any action, and that it has not done so clearly yet.",
      "Meanwhile, what Americans hear from the White House about inflation is, they say, not what they're actually feeling at home: rising prices and worsening economic views.",
      "In the meantime, Americans do not think of Venezuela as a major threat to the US. Instead, more see a minor one, and they are largely opposed to potential military action.",
      "So, the idea of potential U.S. military action in Venezuela meets with widespread disapproval. It doesn't get overwhelming backing from Republicans either.",
      "Three in four Americans also say Trump would need congressional approval before taking military action in Venezuela, including just over half of Republicans.",
      "Just one in five Americans have heard a lot about the U.S. military buildup in the first place. That may be another expression of that sense of limited information about the purpose.",
      "The current military attacks on boats suspected of bringing drugs find division \u2014 just over half approve, driven by nearly universal support among Republicans \u2014 though Americans overall overwhelmingly say they should see the evidence that there are drugs.",
      "However, most Americans don't think U.S. military action in Venezuela would change the amount of drugs coming into the U.S.",
      "Looking more closely within the president's GOP base: MAGA Republicans are actually more supportive of potential military action than non-MAGA ones.",
      "For context, that is similar to what we've seen over time on many issues, including foreign policy, in which that part of the base is largely deferential to the president. (As one example, MAGA was also supportive of the bombing in Iran months ago.) Most of them say the president has explained things, and in turn, are more apt to see any action in Venezuela as decreasing the amount of drugs entering the U.S.",
      "But many who are opposed to military action, including those within the GOP ranks, may also be seeing this in terms of issue priorities. They're a little more likely to judge the administration on what it does about the economy than those in favor. And most who judge him on the economy think he isn't spending enough time on it.",
      "Here's what Americans say about the economy",
      "There's a disconnect between how Americans hear the White House describing the economy, and what they're feeling themselves.",
      "Most Americans say Trump describes things with prices and inflation as better than they really are.",
      "(This includes four in 10 Republicans who say this about Trump. They are also among those more likely to say prices are going up.)",
      "This comes as ratings for the overall economy continue to be low \u2014 as they've been for years \u2014 ticking down this week to their lowest mark in 2025.",
      "Prices, more generally, are still seen by most as going up.",
      "As we head into the holiday season, that economic dissatisfaction includes the majority of Americans who feel President Trump's policies are making the cost of food and groceries, specifically, go up.",
      "So, that disconnect appears to continue to weigh on the president's ratings.",
      "There are many ways Americans judge a president. For those who say they judge Mr. Trump most on what he does about the economy and inflation, they overwhelmingly say he isn't spending enough time on that.",
      "That, in turn, has continued to push his approval on handling the economy and inflation down over the course of several months. That trend continues this week, with assessments of the overall economy, and his ratings for handling the economy and inflation, hitting lows for the year.",
      "More than two-thirds disapprove of his handling of inflation.",
      "He does especially poorly on handling the economy among people who mainly judge him on that.",
      "Among independents, his ratings for handling the economy, and his ratings overall, have also hit lows for the year. That has continued to push his approval rating overall lower over time too, now down to their low point for his second term after a steady decline over recent months.",
      "The president does a little better on his handling of immigration, backed by continued large support from the GOP base, as has been the case for months.",
      "The decline in the president's overall approval ratings connects to people's economic priorities in this way: even among those who voted for him in 2024, disapproval today is more likely to come when people are judging him mostly on the economy.",
      "Deportation",
      "The administration's deportation program continues to split the country, but support is underpinned by strong approval from Republicans.",
      "Most \u2014 particularly those outside the GOP base \u2014 continue to feel that ICE is detaining more people than necessary.",
      "But the deportation program is seen by many as more undermining than strengthening the economy.",
      "One possible reason: a third of the country (who tend to live in cities and suburbs) say it is impacting their community for the worse, and they feel people in their area are staying home more as a result of the program.",
      "Epstein files",
      "Americans across party lines think it is important to see the Epstein files released.",
      "Americans overwhelmingly believe they will contain damaging information about powerful people. Most say it's too soon to know if what's in them is true. On balance, though, more think that information will be true rather than false.",
      "Republicans are more satisfied with how the Trump administration is handling the Epstein case than they were in the summer. (The survey was conducted just after Trump said Congress should vote to release the files, which they did shortly thereafter.) Today, most others are not satisfied.",
      "However, the president's Republican base says issues surrounding the files are not important to how they judge him. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans say this doesn't affect how they evaluate Trump overall. (Independents and Democrats, though, give it comparably more importance in this regard.)",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,489 U.S. adults interviewed between November 19-21, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "published": "Sun, 23 Nov 2025 10:00:29 -0500",
    "summary": "In the Midcoast Maine town of Camden, the Villager Cafe helps support a weekly newspaper, the Midcoast Villager \u2013 dishing up sustainable journalism while sustaining the community.",
    "story": [
      "Those sinful-looking blueberry pancakes, and that nice, noisy foamy latte \u2013 would you believe they are rescuing journalism, in and around Camden, Maine, at least?",
      "Here in lobster country, at the Villager Cafe, customers can have their breakfast or lunch with a side of news, a weekly newspaper called the Midcoast Villager. \"I was just reading about the SNAP benefits and different food pantries in the area,\" said one cafe customer.",
      "The cafe subsidizes the paper; the newsroom is one floor up. Throw in the rent from all the other tenants in the building, along with revenue from the Inn at Camden Place next door (same ownership), and it all helps.",
      "\"From the business standpoint, it achieves a sustainability,\" said Reade Brower. At one time, Brower owned almost all of Maine's newspapers, before selling most of them off. In September 2024, he merged four weeklies into the Midcoast Villager. The cafe opened this past April, but not just to make money.",
      "\"The accountability issues and local sports and all that stuff is important to a lot of people,\" he said. \"I don't think that's enough to sell and keep newspapers alive right now. I think it has to revolve around community. And what better way to serve community than to invite people here for food and to mix all this stuff together?\"",
      "How often do you see the owner of a newspaper, and members of his staff, hanging out with readers over breakfast?",
      "Kathleen Capetta helps Brower run what they both see as an experiment in rebuilding trust in news. \"We're present, we're visible, we're real,\" she said. \"We're not behind a screen.\"",
      "And would that experiment work if the food weren't good? \"Absolutely not, no!\" Capetta laughed.",
      "\"It's good, classic diner food, but a little bit elevated, which is I think kind of like our paper,\" said deputy editor Alex Seitz-Wald. He is the face of the newspaper when he parks himself in the cafe on Friday mornings, to hear complaints, story tips, whatever. \"Having a place where people can vent, or can say something, and have it be heard, I think is really valuable,\" he said.",
      "Seitz-Wald was an NBC politics reporter in Washington, D.C., for a decade before taking a chance \u2013 and a pay cut \u2013 to work for the Midcoast Villager, a start-up in a field where two newspapers die every week.",
      "How's the Villager doing? Circulation revenue, we're told, is 40% above what all four papers it replaced took in \u2013 so, promising.",
      "\"I'm quite glad that I still have a newspaper to work for,\" said Glenn Billington. A local news lifer, he's the optimistic ad salesman and columnist for the Midcoast Villager, just as he was for one of its now-defunct predecessors.",
      "The mascot on the paper's masthead is Vern, who is the epitome of Midcoast Maine. \"He sure is,\" said Billington. \"Look at his sou'wester. He's got the hat that you wear when the wind blows from the southwest and it brings rain. And he's got the telescope. Vern's looking at the future of newspapers.\"",
      "What one sees at the Villager Cafe is old-fashioned \u2013 people sitting down at tables, eating and talking and looking at each other eye-to-eye. Or as Brower put it, \"You're picking up what we're putting down.\"",

    "summary": "The new dummy, known as THOR-05F, contains female-specific proportions, according\u200b to the Transportation Department.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation introduced a new female crash dummy as it seeks to step up safety for women, who face a higher injury risk in car crashes than men.",
      "The U.S. government has used a dummy model for decades that is based almost entirely on male proportions.",
      "The new dummy, known as THOR-05F, is more human-like and contains female-specific proportions, according to the Transportation Department. The new model could potentially replace the Hybrid III dummy, which has previously been utilized for crash testing.",
      "\"Advances in technology now make it possible to more accurately account for the biological differences between male and female anatomy in crash testing,\" the Department of Transportation said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a head-on crash, and they are 17% more likely to be killed in a car crash, than men.",
      "Transportation officials will consider using the new dummy in the government's vehicle crash test five-star ratings once a final rule is adopted, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday in a news release.",
      "The department also noted that THOR-05F will be available to manufacturers to build models and to the automotive industry, which can begin testing the model in their vehicles.",
      "The road to THOR-05F",
      "The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man.",
      "The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "But the change is not guaranteed to happen. Some American automakers have been skeptical and a group representing auto insurers has already said it thinks the current crash test dummies are fine.",
      "The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said.",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn, a law student at New York University, started lobbying members of Congress to pass a law requiring the new female dummy after surviving a 2019 crash in Ireland in which her seat belt slid off her hips and ruptured her intestines. She welcomed Duffy's support but said she won't celebrate until NHTSA incorporates the new model into its testing \u2014 a step that has been delayed numerous times.",
      "\"I fear that with this announcement everybody will throw up their hands and say we've won,\" Kuhn said Friday. \"But we are far from crossing the finish line.\"",
      "Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Despite Duffy's announcement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, continues to advocate for the current line of dummies used to represent women and has seen dramatic improvements in safety as a result, spokesperson Joe Young said.",
      "\"Certainly, we are going to continue to monitor the new tools and perhaps do some additional research,\" Young said. \"But for now, our researchers are content and confident that the dummies we're using are doing a good job.\"",
      "Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements, but developments have been slow.",
      "U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement.",
      "\"Any progress here is good because there's simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,\" Duckworth said.",
      "Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor.",
      "\"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said.",

    "summary": "Bitcoin has erased all of its 2025 gains and is on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022. Here's what experts say about the decline.",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin continued to slide on Friday, extending a weeks-long slump that has wiped out nearly $800 billion in value since the cryptocurrency hit its 2025 peak last month. The downturn has stripped away all of bitcoin's gains this year \u2014 and raised questions about where it might go from here.",
      "Since closing at almost $125,000 on Oct. 6, its highest price this year, bitcoin has shed about one-third of its value. On Friday, bitcoin sank below $82,000 before rebounding slightly to $83,509 before noon EDT, according to CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator.",
      "The cryptocurrency, which is trading at its lowest level since April, is now on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022, when a spate of corporate collapses sparked turbulence in the crypto sector, Bloomberg\u00a0reported\u00a0Friday.",
      "The precipitous drop comes as Wall Street grapples with unease over whether there's a bubble in artificial technology and tech stocks, prompting a shift away from assets that are viewed as carrying more risk, analysts say. Investors are also cautious given signs of weakness in the labor market, and the outlook for the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision next month, with more economists now expecting the Fed to hold off on cutting rates.",
      "\"The future is uncertain. It almost feels like it's moving back to the question: do I even want to hold [bitcoin] in this environment?\" said Thomas Chen, the CEO of cryptocurrency company Function, in an email.",
      "Why is Bitcoin falling?",
      "Concerns about an AI bubble can translate into turbulence for cryptocurrencies because tech stocks tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, experts noted.",
      "\"When tech sneezes, it's natural to expect Bitcoin to catch a cold,\" noted Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, in an email.",
      "Aside from pulling back from riskier assets, some investors may be selling bitcoin to cover margin calls. Coinbase, for example, now offers \"perpetual futures,\" a product that lets traders use up to 10-to-1 leverage on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",
      "Leveraged positions can force investors to sell because borrowing amplifies every price move \u2014 for both gains and losses. Even a small drop in the underlying asset can lead to an outsized loss on a leveraged trade. But if an asset tumbles and the investor can't meet the margin requirements, the trading platform may automatically liquidate the position, which leads to more selling and downward pressure on its price.",
      "\"When traders borrow heavily to magnify positions, any reversal triggers liquidations that accelerate the move,\" Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, a financial advisory organization, said in an email.",
      "Large declines in bitcoin's price aren't unusual, and the cryptocurrency has always rebounded, experts noted.",
      "Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, said in a Tuesday email that bitcoin has historically experienced around five corrections of 20-30% or more during bull markets, adding that the issues may represent \"temporary headwinds\" as some investors could view lower crypto prices as a buying opportunity.",

    "story": [
      "For the first time, FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker is explaining why he decided to announce his resignation just one day after Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race.",
      "\"Look, it's a complicated, emotional decision to leave. But ideologically, there's no doubt that the mayor and I disagree on some very fundamental things to me,\" Tucker, who was appointed to the role in August 2024, told \"CBS Mornings\" in his first interview since handing in his resignation letter on Nov. 5.",
      "In a closely-watched decision last week, Tucker's police counterpart, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted Mamdani's offer to stay in her role. Months before the election, Mamdani softened his sharp criticism of the NYPD and clarified that he is \"not running to defund the police,\" distancing himself from old social media posts.",
      "Despite his public apology to the NYPD, Tucker said Mamdani still has some work to do when it comes to winning over the support of first responders. Beyond that, some of Mamdani's stances, like his refusal to support Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, have alarmed many Jewish New Yorkers.",
      "\"I think it's a factor [in my decision to resign], no doubt,\" said Tucker, who is Jewish. \"And I don't want to tell you that it's the only factor. But I believe that the things that I have heard the mayor say would make it difficult for me to continue on in such a senior executive role in the administration.\"",
      "According to exit polls, 31% of Jewish New Yorkers voted for Mamdani, with 65% voting for independent opponent Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani won every borough but Staten Island.",
      "In an October debate, Mamdani, who will make history as New York City's first Muslim mayor, vowed to \"be the mayor who doesn't just protect Jewish New Yorkers, but also celebrates and cherishes them.\"",
      "However, Tucker and some prominent Jewish leaders \u2013 like Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the senior rabbi at New York City's Central Synagogue \u2013 aren't convinced by the mayor-elect's words of reassurance. In an October sermon, Buchdal accused Mamdani of contributing \"to a mainstreaming of some of the most abhorrent antisemitism.\"",
      "\"More importantly than hearing it, we want to see it,\" Tucker said.",
      "He pointed to Mamdani's response to a protest last week outside of an Upper East Side synagogue hosting an event to support Jewish emigration to Israel, during which activists shouted threats. A Mamdani spokesperson was later quoted saying he \"discouraged the language,\" adding in an apparent nod of support to the protesters that \"these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.\"",
      "Tucker said Mamdani should have come out quickly to condemn the behavior and rhetoric.",
      "\"You know, I don't know that the public has heard appropriately from him,\" he said.",
      "Inside headquarters in Brooklyn, where the FDNY coordinates responses to emergencies across America's biggest city, Tucker says they're still waiting for outreach from Mamdani.",
      "\"I haven't had any personal conversations with the mayor-elect. I haven't heard from anyone in his incoming administration, nor has the department. And so I only hope that is not an indicator of their\u00a0 feelings about the FDNY. I'd like to think they think everything is going so well here that they don't need to transition so fast,\" he joked.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 06:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The number of immigration detainees without criminal records held in detention after getting arrested by ICE has increased by over 2,000% since the start of the second Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "The number of immigration detainees without criminal records who are held in federal detention centers after getting arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement has increased by over 2,000% since the start of the second Trump administration in January, according to official government data.",
      "The statistics, published online by ICE as part of a transparency requirement mandated by Congress, illustrate the wide-ranging scope of President Trump's mass deportation campaign.",
      "On Nov. 16, the government figures show, ICE was holding 65,135 people in detention facilities throughout the U.S., the highest level ever publicly reported by the agency, which was created in 2003 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. CBS News first reported the record detention levels earlier this month, citing internal data.",
      "The official figures indicate that 30,986 \u2013 or 48% \u2014 of the ICE detainees in custody as of Nov. 16 lacked any criminal charges or convictions in the U.S. and were being held solely because of civil violations of U.S. immigration law. ICE calls them \"immigration violators.\"",
      "Those with criminal convictions represented about 26%, or 17,171, of all ICE detainees on Nov. 16. The data show 16,978 individuals \u2014 another 26% of ICE's detainee population \u2014 had criminal charges.",
      "The statistics released by ICE do not specify the severity and nature of the charges or convictions for the detainees with criminal histories. They could range from violent or serious felonies, to misdemeanors and immigration-related crimes, such as illegal re-entry into the U.S.",
      "Illegal presence in the U.S., including after overstaying a visa, is not a crime by itself and is generally handled as a civil matter in immigration court. While illegal entry into the U.S. is a federal misdemeanor crime for a first-time offense with a 5-year statute of limitations, those accused of doing so typically have their cases treated as civil immigration violations, absent additional criminal activity.",
      "While all three categories of ICE detainees \u2014 immigration violators, those with criminal charges and those with criminal convictions \u2014 have grown under the second Trump administration, the statistics published by the agency indicate the non-criminal group has seen the most rapid and pronounced rise.",
      "ICE's detention population includes individuals arrested by that agency, typically in communities or jails inside of the U.S., as well as detainees transferred by Customs and Border Protection. Most detainees initially arrested by CBP, most commonly along the U.S.-Mexico border, historically have lacked criminal histories in the U.S. because many have not lived in the country for significant periods or at all.",
      "As of Nov. 16, 52,510 of ICE's detainees had been initially taken into custody by that agency, while 12,625 had been arrested by CBP.",
      "When focusing solely on ICE detainees initially arrested by that agency \u2014 and not CBP \u2014 the figures show a 2,143% spike in non-criminal detainees from Jan. 26 (945) to Nov. 16 (21,194). The number of detainees initially arrested by ICE who have convictions or criminal charges increased by 73% and 226%, respectively, during that same time period, according to the ICE data.",
      "The latest figures also indicate that for the first time, non-criminal detainees arrested by ICE outnumber those with criminal convictions. From Sept. 21 to Nov. 16, non-criminal detainees increased by about a third, while the number of detained with criminal convictions remained nearly flat.",
      "The numbers underscore that while the Trump administration has said its deportation effort would mainly focus on criminals deemed to be \"the worst of the worst,\" a growing share of those swept up under its crackdown are immigrants accused of living in the U.S. illegally but who otherwise lack any criminal history.",
      "At the same time, some senior Trump administration officials, including border czar Tom Homan and acting ICE director Todd Lyons, have said anyone encountered by immigration authorities and found to be in the U.S. illegally will be arrested, even if they're not the intended target of an operation. Those so-called \"collateral arrests\" had been largely banned under Biden-era rules the Trump administration scrapped.",
      "The government has the legal authority to arrest, detain and process for deportation anyone suspected of violating U.S. immigration law, irrespective of any criminal activity. But some of those individuals may be eligible for forms of legal relief, such as asylum, that can stall or halt their deportation.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the administration is \"targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens\u2014including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.\" She said 70% of those arrested by ICE had criminal charges or convictions, but did not specify a timeframe or offer a breakdown to support the percentage.",
      "McLaughlin also said detainees listed as non-criminals could have warrants or criminal histories outside of the U.S., or otherwise pose a threat to national security. But DHS has not released data showing how many people fall into those categories.",
      "Number of non-criminal detainees arrested by ICE surged 2,000% under Trump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne-third of Border Patrol detainees in Charlotte were classified as criminals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. ending deportation protections for immigrants from war-torn Myanmar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge says Trump official's testimony on removing Abrego Garcia is \"a zero\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaryland mother deported to Vietnam months after being detained by ICE",

The American official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Umerov voiced optimism that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could travel to the U.S. before the end of November to finalize an agreement. CBS News was first to report on Sunday that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Zelenskyy.",
      "\"The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal,\" the U.S. official told CBS News. \"There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal.\"",
      "The news came as U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was in Abu Dhabi to meet with Russian officials, two U.S. officials and two diplomatic sources who were not authorized to speak publicly told CBS News. A fifth source with knowledge of the talks also confirmed Driscoll's presence in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Taking to Truth Social\u00a0on Tuesday afternoon, President Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",
      "The president said he directed his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and that Driscoll would meet with the Ukrainians.",
      "\"I will be briefed on all progress made, along with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages.\"",
      "Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that \"we're making progress.\" Asked what points of disagreement remain, he said, \"standard things,\" but \"people are starting to realize it's a good deal for both parties.\"",
      "On Tuesday morning, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u00a0wrote on X, \"Over the past week, the United States has made tremendous progress towards a peace deal by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the table. There are a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Russia, the invading force, to what was agreed to in Abu Dhabi, and there were no details from U.S. or Ukrainian officials about what is in the latest proposal. Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which include U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all together at the same time.",
      "Speaking earlier on Tuesday, veteran Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that while Russia \"appreciates the U.S.' position, which is taking the initiative in resolving the Ukrainian conflict,\" Moscow \"operates professionally, not leaking information before formal agreements are reached ... Russia expects the U.S. to inform it of the results of consultations with Ukraine and Europe in the near future.\"",
      "Lavrov stressed that, while Russia was still waiting to receive \"from our American colleagues\" an updated version of the peace proposal, Moscow expected it to include basic tenets agreed between Presidents Trump and Putin during their August meeting in Alaska.",
      "\"Key proposals of Trump's plan are based on understandings reached in Anchorage,\" Lavrov said. He said those principles were \"reflected in the plan\" proposed last week by the White House, \"which we welcomed \u2014 President Putin said that.\"",
      "\"We are ready to discuss concrete formulations because there are a whole row of questions that need to be clarified,\" Lavrov said, adding: \"If there will be no spirit and letter of Anchorage on the key understandings that we have fixated, then it will be a different situation in principle.\"",
      "Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which involve U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all meeting together at the same time.",
      "Umerov also\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the country's negotiators had \"reached a common understanding on the core terms\" of an agreement discussed among U.S., European and Ukrainian officials in Geneva over the weekend.",
      "\"We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps. We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine's President to the U.S. at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump,\" Umerov said.",
      "A Trump administration official said there was no agreement for Zelenskyy to come to the U.S. as of late Tuesday morning, but that if a meeting does happen in the coming days, it could take place at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "A U.S. military official in Abu Dhabi told CBS News Driscoll spent hours negotiating Tuesday with Russian representatives, going in and out of meetings all day.",
      "\"We remain very optimistic,\" the official said. \"Secretary Driscoll is optimistic. Hopefully, we'll get feedback from the Russians soon. This is moving quick.\"",
      "It is not clear who else is in the U.S. delegation in Abu Dhabi. A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation was also there and has been in contact with Driscoll and his team.",
      "The apparent progress in Abu Dhabi comes amid an intensified push by President Trump to secure a ceasefire in the almost four-year-long Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "A source with knowledge told CBS News that Driscoll was working in Abu Dhabi off of a revised version of the White House's 28-point proposal, following productive negotiations in Geneva.",
      "Over the weekend, Driscoll, Rubio, Witkoff, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomats from Ukraine and European allies attended talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Driscoll's meeting with Russian officials also follows a visit to Ukraine's capital last week.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, CBS News reported on Sunday.",
      "Last week, CBS News obtained a draft of one Trump administration-backed proposal to end the war. The proposed plan included several provisions that Zelenskyy has rejected in the past, such as a requirement that Ukraine give up its entire Donetsk region \u2014 including parts that aren't occupied by Russia \u2014 and an end to the country's push to join NATO.",
      "There is also an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday the document specifies that the U.S. intends to offer \"security assurances\" that she said are along the lines of Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which\u00a0commits members to come to the defense of a NATO state that is attacked.",
      "On Saturday, a group of NATO members and other U.S. allies released a joint statement calling the proposed peace plan \"a basis which will require additional work.\"",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following the discussions in Geneva. Rubio described one session in Geneva as \"very meaningful\" but added that \"there's still some work left to do, and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",

The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct.",
      "While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk.

    "story": [
      "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem made the final decision to allow a group of deportees to be handed over to El Salvador after a judge said their flights must be returned to the United States, the Justice Department said in a court filing Tuesday.",
      "The filing came as U.S. District Judge James Boasberg continues his inquiry into whether the Trump administration violated his orders to halt the mid-March deportation flights, including his verbal directive that the government resort to \"turning around a plane\" if necessary. Boasberg has accused the government of showing a \"willful disregard\" for his rulings.",
      "The administration, the Justice Department argued on Tuesday, \"did not violate\" Boasberg's order, and \"no further proceedings are warranted or appropriate.\"",
      "But the administration did identify which Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department officials were involved in the decision not to turn the deportation flights around.",
      "Shortly after Boasberg issued his rulings, Justice Department official Drew Ensign conveyed them to the DHS and Justice Department leadership, according to Tuesday's filing. Then, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and former Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove offered advice to DHS's acting general counsel, who passed on the advice to Noem.",
      "Noem concluded the class of detainees \"who had been removed from the United States before the Court's order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador,\" according to the filing.",
      "The filing says this move \"was lawful and was consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the Court's order.\"",
      "The flights in question were part of a Trump administration initiative to send accused Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador, whose government held them in prison for months. The administration argues that gambit was legal under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and warranted as part of its crackdown on violent crime, but it has faced pushback from courts and advocates who argue the deportees weren't given sufficient due process.",
      "One lawsuit brought by migrants led Boasberg to order a temporary halt to removals under the Alien Enemies Act, including by returning deportation flights that had already taken off. But the midair flights continued on to El Salvador. Boasberg accused the government of disobeying those orders, and said there is probable cause to hold the government in contempt of court.",
      "The administration has long denied that it disobeyed Boasberg, pointing to discrepancies between his written and verbal orders on March 15. The judge blocked a set of Alien Enemies Act deportations in his written order, but unlike in his verbal order earlier in the day, he didn't explicitly reiterate that the government must turn around planes that were already en route.",
      "Appeals court judges tossed out Boasberg's finding of probable cause, but a different panel later said that Boasberg, who is the chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., could continue his probe into whether the Trump administration had violated his court order. He signaled last week that he will resume his contempt of court inquiry.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the plaintiffs, has asked for more than half a dozen potential DHS and Justice Department witnesses to be put on the stand in open court to testify about the decision not to turn the planes around.",
      "One witness that the ACLU suggested is former Justice Department attorney Erez Revueni, who has accused the department of trying to defy or mislead judges in several instances, including in the deportation case. The department has denied Reuveni's allegations.",

    "summary": "The fee change for international visitors will impact 11 national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, according to the Interior Department.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday the National Park Service is going to start charging the millions of international tourists who visit U.S. national parks each year $100 per person to enter some of the most popular sites, while leaving them out of fee-free days that will be reserved for American residents.",
      "The fee change for international visitors will impact 11 national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, according to the Interior Department.",
      "As part of the changes, which are set to take effect Jan. 1, foreign tourists will also see their annual parks pass price jump to $250, while U.S. residents will continue to be charged $80, according to the department's statement.",
      "Only approximately 100 of the more than 400 parks in the national park system collect an entrance fee.",
      "The announcement declaring \"America-first entry fee policies\" comes as national parks deal with the strain of a major staff reduction and severe budget cuts, along with recovering from damage during the recent government shutdown and significant lost revenue due to fees not being collected during that time. The park service furloughed well over half its staff during the shutdown.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a post on the social platform X that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers who support the park service \"continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!\"",
      "A White House social media post laying out the increased fees ended with the phrase, \"AMERICANS FIRST.\"",
      "The announcement follows a July executive order in which President Donald Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump also ordered the Interior Department to give U.S. residents \"preferential treatment\" over foreign visitors regarding \"recreational access rules, including permitting or lottery rules\" that parks might have in place.",
      "In its 2026 fiscal year\u00a0budget proposal\u00a0released in May, the Interior Department estimated that such a surcharge on international visitors would generate more than $90 million annually.",
      "\"There's a lot to unpack in this announcement, including many questions on its implementation \u2013 all which NPCA will raise with the Department of Interior,\" Kati Schmidt, a spokesperson for National Parks Conservation Association, said in an email.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association estimated that in 2018, national parks and monuments saw more than 14 million international visitors. Yellowstone reported that in 2024, nearly 15% of its visitors were from outside the country, which was down from 30% in 2018.",
      "The money made off the new fees will help support the national parks, including with upgrading facilities for visitors and maintenance, according to the statement.",
      "The \"resident-only patriotic fee-free days\" next year include Veterans Day, which was one of the parks' eight free days open to everyone in 2025. The Department of the Interior had announced those days by saying they wanted to ensure that \"everyone, no matter their zip code, can access and enjoy the benefits of green spaces and our public lands.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has directed immigration officials to review the cases of refugees admitted under former President Joe Biden, as part of an unprecedented effort to identify potential reasons that would disqualify them from being able to stay in the U.S., an internal federal government memo obtained by CBS News shows.",
      "The memo, dated Nov. 21 and signed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow, instructs agency officials to investigate the cases of refugees who entered the U.S. over a four-year period, between Jan. 20, 2021, and Feb. 20, 2025.",
      "Edlow directed USCIS officials to review the cases of all refugees admitted during this time period, and to potentially reinterview them. Those investigations and reinterviews, Edlow wrote, would focus on determining whether those individuals met the definition of a refugee when they entered the U.S. and whether there are any legal barriers that would make them ineligible to become permanent residents of the U.S.",
      "The memo also placed an indefinite hold on all pending applications for green cards (or permanent residency) filed by refugees allowed into the country during the timeframe outlined in the memo. Under U.S. law, refugees are eligible for permanent residency one year after being admitted.",
      "Edlow noted that applicants cannot appeal any denials of their green card cases. If the cases of \"principal\" refugees \u2014 or the main applicant if they arrived with their family members \u2014 are rejected, their relatives' cases would also be denied, and they would be stripped of their refugee status, according to the memo. Those whose applications are denied can be placed in deportation proceedings.",
      "Refugees have to prove they suffered or fled persecution abroad based on one of five factors: their race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in a social group.",
      "Some 233,000 refugees entered the U.S. between February 2021 and January 2025, a period that largely lines up with the Biden administration, according to federal statistics.",
      "The federal government paused the refugee program shortly after President Trump retook office. Officials have made limited exceptions, mostly for Afrikaners, or people in South Africa who are the descendants of European settlers.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration capped refugee admissions for this fiscal year at 7,500, the lowest level in history. Those slots will \"primarily be allocated among Afrikaners,\" who the Trump administration alleges have faced discrimination in South Africa for being White, and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" The South African government has denied that Afrikaners are being persecuted.",
      "Before the pause, refugees typically spent years in third countries undergoing medical checks, security screenings and interviews prior to being admitted into the U.S.",
      "But in his memo, Edlow said the Trump administration believes the Biden administration \"prioritized expediency, quantity, and admissions over quality interviews and detailed screening and vetting.\"",
      "The memo was first reported by CNN.",

    "story": [
      "Republican Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia has agreed to pay nearly $5.2 million in overdue personal taxes, the latest saga for the former billionaire who has been followed by a trail of financial challenges going back well over a decade.",
      "An attorney for Justice and his wife, Cathy, entered into a joint motion for consent judgment with the federal government on Monday, the same day the government filed a lawsuit saying the couple \"have neglected or refused to make full payment\" for the income taxes dating to 2009. An attorney for the Justice Department's tax division signed off on the agreement.",
      "Justice had a fortune estimated at $1.9 billion last decade by Forbes magazine, which stripped his billionaire title in 2021, when Justice's worth had dwindled to an estimated $513 million. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated that Justice's net worth had disintegrated to \"less than zero\" due to liabilities that far exceeded assets.",
      "A spokesperson for Justice's office didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.",
      "During a briefing with local media in October, Justice asserted that his companies \"are complicated and complex\" and that his children \"are doing a magnificent job\" running them. He then repeated past assertions that collection efforts against him were politically motivated, before concluding: \"At the end of the day, I'd say just let it be and see how it all plays out.\"",
      "Justice, a former two-term governor who owns dozens of businesses that include coal and agricultural operations, was elected last November to the Senate. He took over the seat vacated by the retiring Joe Manchin, a Democrat who became an independent in 2024 near the end of his second full term.",
      "Justice still has other financial challenges to work out.",
      "The Internal Revenue Service last month filed liens totaling more than $8 million against Justice and his wife on unpaid personal taxes. In September, state tax officials filed $1.4 million in liens against the Justice family's historic hotel, The Greenbrier, and the resort's Greenbrier Sporting Club, over unpaid sales taxes.",
      "Last month, a foreclosure auction on several hundred lots owned by the Justice family at a resort community near Beckley was paused. The auction centered on a dispute between the Glade Springs Village Property Owners Association and Justice Holdings over unpaid fees. The state Supreme Court plans to review the case more closely.",
      "In 2021, the IRS filed liens over $1.1 million in unpaid taxes on the Greenbrier Hotel and an additional $80,000 on the resort's medical clinic. Those debts were paid off later that year.",
      "Justice's family settled debts last year in a separate case to avoid the Greenbrier Hotel's foreclosure. The 710-room hotel, which has hosted U.S. presidents, royalty and congressional retreats, had come under threat of being auctioned off on the steps of a Lewisburg courthouse. That was after JPMorgan Chase sold a longstanding loan taken out by Justice to a credit collection company, Beltway Capital, which declared it to be in default.",
      "The state Democratic Party has said efforts to seize the hotel from Justice were \"a direct consequence of his own financial incompetence.\"",
      "Last year, a union official at the Greenbrier said that Justice's family was at least $2.4 million behind in payments to an employees' health insurance fund, putting workers' coverage at risk. In 2023, dozens of properties owned by the Justice family in three counties were auctioned as payment for delinquent real estate taxes. Others have sought to recoup millions in fines for environmental issues and unsafe working conditions at his company's coal mines.",
      "Justice bought The Greenbrier resort out of bankruptcy in 2009 for $20.1 million. The sporting club is a private equity club and residential community on the property that opened in 2000.",
      "The resort in White Sulphur Springs that dates to 1778 also has a casino, spa and dozens of amenities and employs around 2,000 workers. The resort held a PGA Tour golf tournament from 2010 until 2019 and has welcomed NFL teams for training camp and practices. A once-secret 112,000-square-foot underground bunker built for Congress at the Greenbrier in case of nuclear attack during the Cold War now hosts tours.",

      "They go by names like @TRUMP_ARMY\u2014 or @MAGANationX, and their verified accounts proudly display portraits of President Donald Trump, voter rallies and American flags. And they're constantly posting about U.S. politics to their followers, sounding like diehard fans of the president.",
      "But after a weekend update to the social media platform X, it's now clear that the owners of these accounts, and many others, are located in regions such as South Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe.",
      "Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature Saturday that lets users see where an account is based. Online sleuths and experts quickly found that many popular accounts posting in support of the MAGA movement to thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers, are based outside the United States \u2014 raising concerns about foreign influence on U.S. politics.",
      "Researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks online misinformation, identified several popular accounts \u2014 purportedly run by Americans interested in politics \u2014 that instead were based in Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa.",
      "The accounts were leading disseminators of some misleading and polarizing claims about U.S. politics, including ones that said Democrats bribed the moderators of a 2024 presidential debate.",
      "Nikita Bier, X's head of product, announced Saturday that the social media platform is rolling out an \"About This Account\" tool, which lets users see the country or region where an account is based. To find an account's location, tap or click the signup date displayed on the profile.",
      "\"This is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square. We plan to provide many more ways for users to verify the authenticity of the content they see on X,\" Bier wrote.",
      "In countries with punitive speech restrictions, a privacy tool on X lets account holders only show their region rather than a specific country. So instead of India, for instance, an account can say it is based in South Asia.",
      "Bier said Sunday that after an update to the tool, it would 99.99% accurate, though this could not be independently verified. Accounts, for instance, can use a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask their true location. On some accounts, there's a notice saying the location data may not be accurate, either because the account uses a VPN or because some internet providers use proxies automatically, without action by the user.",
      "\"Location data will always be something to use with caution,\" said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech and a former director of the International Fact-Checking Network. \"Its usefulness probably peaks now that it was just exposed, and bad actors will adapt. Meta has had similar information for a while and no one would suggest that misinformation has been eliminated from Facebook because of it.\"",
      "Some of the accounts supported slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as well as President Donald Trump's children. Many of the accounts were adorned with U.S. flags or made comments suggesting they were American. An account called \"@BarronTNews_,\" for instance, is shown as being located in \"Eastern Europe (Non-EU),\" even though the display location on its profile says \"Mar A Lago.\" The account, which has more than 580,000 followers, posted on Tuesday that \"This is a FAN account, 100 % independent, run by one guy who loves this country and supports President Trump with everything I've got.\"",
      "Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS News these types of accounts are fueled by public interest in current events and America's highly polarized politics.",
      "\"It is shining a light on this new rage economy that exists on social media, including X, that takes advantage of current things,\" Krebs said. \"What's the latest event? As we've seen over the last couple of years ... there has been a rightward shift of the platform. And I think what we're really seeing here is foreign-based accounts that are looking to make a little bit of money and taking advantage of this.\"",
      "He added, \"I think X deserves some credit to shine a light, to kind of expose some of these. ... I suspect you'll see a bunch of these accounts lose influence.\"",
      "NewsGuard also found evidence that some X users are spreading misinformation about the location feature itself, incorrectly accusing some accounts of being operated from abroad when they're actually used by Americans. Investigators found several instances where one user created fake screenshots that appear to suggest an account was created overseas.",
      "It's not always clear what the motives of the accounts. While some may be state actors, it's likely that many are financially motivated, posting commentary, memes and videos to draw engagement.",
      "\"For the most visible accounts unmasked this week, money is probably the main motivator,\" Mantzarlis said. \"That doesn't mean that X \u2014 as documented extensively by prior work done by academic and nonprofit organizations that are being attacked and defunded \u2014 isn't also a target for state actors.\"",
      "Users were divided over the new ability to see an account's location information, with some questioning whether it went too far.",
      "\"Isn't this kind of an invasion of privacy?\" One X user wrote. \"No one needs to see this info.\"",

The FBI has now ruled her out as a suspect in the 2021 plot, according to three sources \u2014 but only after her name circulated on social platforms and a conservative news site.",
      "How an innocent woman's name came to be publicly linked to the unexploded pipe bombs is a question that has raised concerns among some senior officials in the Trump administration.",
      "CBS News is not naming the security officer or her workplace. The federal agency she protects declined to comment.",
      "Multiple sources said that a unit overseen by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard drafted a memo identifying the woman and describing allegations that she had placed the explosive devices outside Democratic and Republican party offices. The memo was written after ODNI was made aware of allegations from an outside source, an ODNI spokesperson said.",
      "ODNI officials said the agency received a tip from a person affiliated with a media organization about potential criminal wrongdoing by an individual believed to be working at an intelligence agency and set about documenting it in a memo.",
      "A copy of the unfinished memo was given to senior staff at the security officer's workplace, sources said.",
      "It also circulated among a few Trump administration officials, building expectations that the nearly five-year-old case might be solved. But the memo caught some officials at the FBI, Justice Department and White House off guard, the sources said.",
      "ODNI oversees the nation's foreign intelligence gathering and has limited domestic investigative authorities. The FBI is leading the pipe bomb investigation.",
      "A short time after the unfinished memo began to circulate, the conservative news outlet, Blaze News, published details similar to those in the draft, including the woman's full name.",
      "The Nov. 8 Blaze News article claimed that it had pinpointed the woman after a review of video evidence and \"gait analysis\" software matched her walking pattern to the gait of a person shown in surveillance footage, who authorities suspect planted bombs outside the party offices on Jan. 5, 2021.",
      "Blaze News said its work had been \"confirmed by several intelligence sources.\"",
      "Several sources told CBS News that the classified draft memo, which was on ODNI letterhead, was written by Paul McNamara, who is in charge of Gabbard's Director's Initiatives Group, which is tasked with providing \"transparency and accountability\" and executing President Trump's intelligence-related executive orders. McNamara could not be reached for comment.",
      "A spokesperson, Olivia Coleman, said, \"ODNI followed its obligation to report information received concerning the alleged activities of a member of the Intelligence Community to that person's employing agency.\"",
      "\"After a whistleblower came forward with an allegation, ODNI documented the accusation and lawfully reported it, fulfilling our legal duty to alert appropriate agencies when alleged/potential security concerns are brought to our attention,\" Coleman said. \"There were no predetermined conclusions or assessments made, and every action taken was done so in consultation with legal counsel.\"",
      "The Blaze report became the subject of extensive media coverage and discussion on social media, especially among supporters of Mr. Trump.",
      "Word of this supposed break in the case reached Mr. Trump, two of the sources said, although it's unclear how he learned of it.",
      "The bomb-planting incident is one of the lingering mysteries surrounding the events around the Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021, on the eve of the Jan. 6 riot. Nearly five years since the pipe bombs were placed, no suspect has been arrested or identified. The FBI said the bombs were viable, but they did not detonate.",
      "CBS News was not shown the memo, but sources said McNamara had accessed confidential files to obtain details about the woman for the draft memo, including her place of work and Social Security number.",
      "Gabbard, the top ODNI official, has since distanced herself from the memo, telling senior officials that the information about the woman spread without her knowledge while Gabbard was traveling abroad, several sources said.",
      "An ODNI official also said the draft memo hadn't been reviewed or approved by agency leadership.",
      "Sources said this situation, and others, were viewed internally by some senior administration officials as interfering in areas that were beyond the purview of the national intelligence director's office. Axios reported in September that Justice Department officials believed ODNI had hindered their case against former CIA Director John Brennan. The New York Times in October reported that ODNI had accessed FBI investigative files related to Charlie Kirk's assassination, searched for evidence of conspiracies and potentially undermined the government's case against the alleged assassin.",
      "The federal security officer cooperated with the FBI, sources close to the matter said. Her lawyer said publicly she had done nothing wrong. Both the woman and her lawyer declined to comment.",
      "She returned to work after being placed on a brief leave, one of the sources said.",
      "An FBI spokesperson and representatives for Blaze News didn't respond to requests for comment. Blaze News updated its story with one correction and further information, but it remains online.",
      "FBI officials have said they're continuing to pursue leads in the pipe bomb case.",

    "story": [
      "Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Trump housing official Bill Pulte, who referred him to the Justice Department earlier this month for an investigation of mortgage and tax fraud allegations.",
      "Swalwell, who entered the California governor's race last week, filed the 19-page federal civil lawsuit in the U.S. Court for the District of Columbia accusing Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, of violations of privacy in obtaining Swalwell's mortgage records. The lawsuit also accuses the Trump administration of engaging in a pattern of political retribution through the courts.",
      "\"Pulte's brazen practice of obtaining confidential mortgage records from Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac and then using them as a basis for referring individual homeowners to DOJ for prosecution is unprecedented and unlawful,\" the lawsuit alleged.",
      "Pulte has also submitted criminal referrals to the Justice Department for investigations of Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The allegations against Swalwell are related to the mortgage on his property in Washington, D.C., CBS News previously reported.",
      "Swalwell's lawsuit says that the disclosure of his mortgage records harmed his reputation \"at a critical juncture in his career: the very moment when he had planned to announce his campaign for Governor of California.\"",
      "The civil complaint said that \"before President Trump reassumed office in January 2025, he routinely threatened to use his power to punish his political opponents,\" and then continued that \"after taking office, he wasted little time in following through on those threats.\"",
      "James' criminal case was dismissed Monday after a judge found that the interim U.S. attorney who secured her indictment was improperly appointed. James has also sought to have her case tossed out on other grounds, including that the prosecutions are vindictive and selective.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in August after Pulte accused her of making misrepresentations on mortgage documents. But Cook filed a lawsuit arguing her removal was unlawful, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments in January on whether Mr. Trump can fire her from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "Pulte referred Schiff to the Justice Department in May for investigation over alleged mortgage fraud. Sources told CBS News last week that the Justice Department is investigating the probe into Schiff, who has denied any wrongdoing.",

      "A group of civil rights organizations is seeking an order to prevent the closure of a Justice Department office dedicated to preventing unrest and violence in U.S. cities.",
      "The groups are suing for a preliminary injunction to avert the closure of the Community Relations Service, which was launched in 1964 to avert rioting and racial strife in American communities.",
      "The office has been known informally as \"America's Peacemaker.\"",
      "As CBS News reported in April, the Trump administration was planning to shutter the Community Relations Service.",
      "In the lawsuit filed Tuesday, several organizations, including multiple NAACP branches and the Missionary Baptist Convention of Missouri, argue that the Justice Department is violating the law in closing the office.",
      "\"Rather than pursue legislation to eliminate the agency, however, (the Justice Department) set out to destroy the Community Relations Service unilaterally,\" the lawsuit said. \"Defendants did so behind closed doors, without notice or public input, and without consulting the communities that depend on the Community Relations Service.\"",
      "\"The Department of Justice refuses to follow the law \u2014 and it cannot offer any coherent explanation for its actions,\" the lawsuit also said. \"Instead, the Executive Branch is brazenly defying Congress.\"",
      "President John F. Kennedy conceived of the office in the early 1960s, saying the federal government should have experts who can \"identify tensions before they reach the crisis stage\" and \"work quietly to ease tensions and improve relations in any community threatened or torn with strife.\"",
      "The office has a history of intervening during periods of heightened national unrest. It was credited with helping prevent another riot in 1993, as racial tensions re-emerged after the second trial of police who beat Rodney King in California.",
      "It also worked to ease rising racial tensions after the 1997 fatal police shooting of a Chinese-American man in Rohnert Park, California, in Akron, Ohio, in 2022, after the shooting of a Black man by police and deploying twice to Minneapolis during the trial of Derek Chauvin after the killing of George Floyd in 2020 in Minnesota.",
      "The newly filed lawsuit also includes details of the office's history, pointing out that in the 1970s, CRS had been \"involved in mediating school desegregation conflicts\" and played a major role in helping Boston address the busing crisis that arose during desegregation.",
      "Kyle Freeny, a senior attorney with the Washington Litigation Group, is representing the civil rights groups in their lawsuit.",
      "\"The Community Relations Service was not an abstract government agency to these plaintiffs,\" Freeny told CBS News. \"It was an active partner helping them mediate racial tensions, support faith communities, protect vulnerable students and address discrimination in real time. By dismantling CRS, the government cut off proven, irreplaceable support that these organizations depended on to carry out their missions.\"",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.",
      "In a speech in July 2024, Justin Lock, a former director of the Community Relations Service, lauded the office's accomplishments, saying it had been \"at the intersection of some of the most critical moments in our nation's journey toward justice.\"",
      "\"In 2020, when Americans marched in solidarity with the people of Brunswick, Georgia; Louisville, Kentucky; and Minneapolis, Minnesota, following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, CRS engaged with communities as an impartial, confidential facilitator, helping stakeholders identify and implement solutions that help communities to heal and move forward,\" Locke said.",

    "summary": "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
    "story": [
      "Two turkeys headed Tuesday from the posh Willard Hotel to the White House, becoming the latest turkeys to be pardoned by an American president in a tradition that officially dates back to President George H.W. Bush.",
      "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
      "During his time in office, Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the celebration of Thanksgiving, triumphing over similar efforts of presidents who came before him, according to the National Park Service.",
      "The official designation of the annual national holiday is due, in part, to writer Sarah Josepha Hale. The NPS notes that in 1827 \u2014 as editor of \"Boston's Ladies Magazine\" \u2014 Hale began writing essays calling for the national holiday. Finally, on Sept. 18, 1863, she wrote to Lincoln asking him to use his presidential powers to create the holiday.",
      "Lincoln obliged and a few weeks later, on Oct. 3, 1863 \u2014 during the height of the Civil War \u2014 he issued the Thanksgiving Proclamation. Ever since, the country has celebrated Thanksgiving Day.",
      "But it wasn't until after a bill passed by Congress on Dec. 26, 1941, that made the holiday fall annually on the fourth Thursday in November.",
      "Thanksgiving at the White House is usually relatively quiet and includes the tradition of pardoning lucky turkeys from their doomed fate of the dinner table.",
      "Presidential turkey pardons",
      "The first turkey pardon ever issued is believed to have been by Lincoln as recorded by White House reporter Noah Brooks in an 1865 dispatch, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "Lincoln had granted clemency to a turkey named Jack belonging to his son Tad Lincoln, that had originally been slated to be gobbled up at the family's Christmas dinner in 1863.",
      "But the annual practice in which the White House sent pardoned presentation turkeys to a farm to live out their days did not occur until Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s, the WHHA says. In decades prior, presidents would occasionally receive turkeys from the poultry industry and decide not to eat them without an official pardon.",
      "The WHHA notes the practice of sending presentation turkeys to the president became a norm in 1981, and the pardoning ceremonies quickly became a national sensation. By 1989, the annual tradition materialized with President George H.W. Bush \u2014 as documented by the association \u2014 speaking to the pardoned turkey, saying the line his successors still reprise at ceremonies today: \"He's granted a presidential pardon as of right now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, President Trump pardoned Gobble and Waddle, with Waddle ready to stand in if Gobble cannot perform his duties. Mr. Trump issued Gobble a \"complete and unconditional pardon, telling the turkey \"God bless you.\"",
      "Gathering with family and friends",
      "Aside from the turkey pardoning spectacle, presidents spend Thanksgiving in the same fashion as households across the country.",
      "The first documented Thanksgiving gathering at the White House dates back to Nov. 28, 1878, according to the WHHA. Then-President Rutherford B. Hayes held a large Thanksgiving dinner gathering with his family and private secretaries, singing hymns in the Red Room afterward and inviting African-American staff to enjoy their own Thanksgiving meal in the State Dining Room.",
      "The tradition has since withstood the test of time. Through economic hardship and times of wars, presidents have carved out time for family. The WHHA notes that President Woodrow Wilson's first Thanksgiving meal during World War I on Nov. 29, 1917, was an economical one \u2014 and one without cranberries.",
      "In recent decades, presidents have taken to the tradition of celebrating the holiday outside the White House at their so-called \"go-to\" vacation spots. President Ronald Reagan in 1985 traveled to the family ranch in Santa Barbara, California.",
      "Mr. Trump will be traveling to Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, as he did nearly every Thanksgiving in his first term. Former President Joe Biden, meanwhile, traveled to Nantucket over the weekend, per his daughter's Instagram, a Biden family tradition for\u00a0over 40 years.",

      "In evaluating the text of Section 546, Currie found that the power to name an interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia for 120 days to fill the current vacancy rested not with the attorney general, but with district court for the region. She wrote that if the government's interpretation of the law were correct, then the president could evade the Senate confirmation process \"indefinitely\" by \"stacking\" consecutive 120-day appointments.",
      "\"In sum, the text, structure, and history of section 546 point to one conclusion: the Attorney General's authority to appoint an interim U.S. Attorney lasts for a total of 120 days from the date she first invokes section 546 after the departure of a Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorney,\" Currie wrote. \"If the position remains vacant at the end of the 120-day period, the exclusive authority to make further interim appointments under the statute shifts to the district court, where it remains until the President's nominee is confirmed by the Senate. Ms. Halligan was not appointed in a manner consistent with this framework.\"",
      "She concluded that Halligan has been unlawfully serving as interim U.S. attorney since Sept. 22. Comey was indicted Sept. 25, and James was charged Oct. 9.",
      "Halligan's appointment",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in one of the criminal cases brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith. She took over as the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia in a temporary capacity in late September and sought the indictments against Comey and James soon after.",
      "Bondi tapped Halligan as interim U.S. attorney shortly after her predecessor, Erik Siebert, abruptly left the post amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute James.",
      "Bondi appointed Halligan under Section 546, the federal law that governs U.S. attorney vacancies and allows the attorney general to select an interim U.S. attorney, who can then serve for 120 days. The Trump administration has invoked that law and another measure to install temporary prosecutors in New Jersey, Nevada and Los Angeles, though three different federal judges have all found they were serving unlawfully.",
      "In the U.S. Attorney's Office in eastern Virginia, Siebert had first been tapped to lead the office in January to serve for 120 days. Ahead of the expiration of his term, the federal court for the region voted to keep him in the role, exercising authority granted to it under federal law.",
      "After Siebert departed, though, Mr. Trump urged Bondi to install Halligan in the post. Bondi issued a September order purporting to name Halligan as the interim U.S. attorney, to serve for 120 days. Days after she took the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Halligan secured the two-count indictment against Comey, which accuses him of lying to Congress during testimony in September 2020 and obstructing a congressional proceeding. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted in early October on charges of bank fraud. Both have pleaded not guilty to their respective charges.",
      "Comey's attorneys argued that his indictment was \"fatally flawed\" because Halligan, who alone presented the case to the grand jury and signed the indictment, was invalidly appointed to her position.",
      "They argued that under the framework for a temporary U.S. attorney appointment, the 120-day clock starts from the time of the attorney general's initial appointment of Siebert and limits the total tenure of interim appointments to 120 days. Because Siebert had already served the 120 days, only the district court had authority to appoint a successor, defense lawyers said.",
      "But Justice Department lawyers defended the validity of Halligan's selection and argued the 120-day limit applies on a \"per-appointment basis.\" Each appointment, they said, triggers its own clock and requires the attorney general to revisit her interim selections every 120 days.",
      "To shore up Halligan's work in Comey and James' cases, the Justice Department submitted to the court an October order from Bondi that also purported to name her special attorney, applied retroactively, and ratified her actions before the grand juries and signature on the indictments.",
      "Justice Department lawyers argued that even if Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was invalid, any government lawyer can present a case to a grand jury or sign an indictment, and Bondi has the authority to make her a government attorney.",
      "But Currie rejected Bondi's attempt to retroactively name Halligan as a special attorney and wrote that the Justice Department has not pointed to any authority that allows the attorney general to \"reach back in time and rewrite the terms of a past appointment.\" She also said the attorney general's attempt to ratify Halligan's actions falls short.",
      "\"The implications of a contrary conclusion are extraordinary,\" Currie wrote. \"It would mean the Government could send any private citizen off the street \u2014 attorney or not \u2014 into the grand jury room to secure an indictment so long as the Attorney General gives her approval after the fact. That cannot be the law.\"",
      "Currie heard arguments on Comey's bid to dismiss the case on the appointment grounds earlier this month alongside the similar effort by James. Like in Comey's case, only Halligan presented the case against James to the grand jury and signed the indictment.",
      "Asked on Monday if the ruling would have any impact on Halligan's role, Bondi told reporters, \"it does not.\"",
      "\"We have made Lindsay Halligan a special U.S. attorney so she is in court,\" Bondi said. \"She can fight in court just like she was, and we believe we will be successful on appeal.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday called for the U.S. to weigh labeling some Middle Eastern affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, taking aim at the controversial Islamist movement.",
      "In an executive order, the president directed his administration to consider whether to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan or elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations. He gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 30 days to submit a report, and 45 days after that to take action.",
      "The order claimed the three countries' Muslim Brotherhood affiliates \"engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilization campaigns.\"",
      "It accused the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood's Lebanese chapter of helping launch rockets at Israel after the terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and alleged a leader of the Egyptian chapter \"encouraged violent attacks against U.S. partners\" after the attack.",
      "The White House also said members of the Jordanian chapter have \"long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas,\" itself a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.",
      "If the groups are designated as foreign terrorist organizations, it would become illegal under U.S. law to knowingly provide funding or other material support to them. The designation can also lead to travel bans against members or the freezing of funds held in U.S. banks.",
      "Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood is an influential political movement in much of the Middle East. The leader of a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political party, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president of Egypt in 2012 after the fall of dictator Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi was ousted by the military the following year.",
      "Some Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt and elsewhere have renounced violence. But the group has long been controversial, with critics \u2014 including U.S. allies \u2014 saying some affiliated groups have engaged in violence or espoused extremist views. Egypt's military government formally banned the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and Jordan banned the group earlier this year.",
      "\"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet.",
      "Mr. Trump's order comes about a week after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and banned it from buying land. Abbott made a similar move toward the Council on American-Islamic Relations, drawing a lawsuit from the civil rights group.",
      "The president has used the executive power to designate groups as terrorist organizations broadly.",
      "His administration labeled several Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups earlier this year, and recently applied the designation to Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, as the administration puts more pressure on the Venezuelan government and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Some analysts say it's not a centralized drug cartel in the traditional sense, but is instead a loosely defined network of government officials accused of links to organized crime and drug trafficking.",
      "The administration earlier this year also designated four European groups that it said are affiliated with antifa. Mr. Trump has labeled antifa as a domestic terror organization, though there isn't a formal system for designating U.S.-based terror groups, and antifa usually refers to a loose collection of left-wing activists rather than a single organization with centralized leadership.",
      "Mr. Trump also considered labeling the Muslim Brotherhood as a terror group in his first term.",

    "summary": "Fewer than one-third of those arrested by Border Patrol during the recent immigration crackdown in Charlotte were classified as criminals, a government document says.",
    "story": [
      "Fewer than one-third of the individuals arrested by Border Patrol during the Trump administration's recent immigration enforcement crackdown in Charlotte were classified as criminals, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security document obtained by CBS News.",
      "The government document undermines claims by Trump administration officials who said the crackdown, dubbed Operation Charlotte's Web, was primarily focused on apprehending immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who also had criminal histories and posed a threat to public safety.",
      "Roughly 200 green-uniformed Border Patrol agents recorded more than 270 immigration arrests during the Charlotte campaign, which began on the weekend of Nov. 15, the document shows. Fewer than 90 of those arrested by Border Patrol were categorized as \"criminal aliens\" in the document.",
      "Those statistics do not include arrests made by officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, though Border Patrol played the principal role in Operation Charlotte's Web. The document also does not specify the severity of the crimes of the detainees listed as criminals, nor whether their records included convictions or solely criminal charges.",
      "While DHS has publicly maintained that the crackdown in Charlotte is ongoing, separate internal documents say Border Patrol's operation there concluded, with agents demobilizing from the area last week. ICE has a permanent presence in North Carolina, and is expected to continue operations there.",
      "CBS News has reported, citing U.S. officials and internal DHS documents, that Border Patrol is preparing to launch a new operation in New Orleans as soon as the first week of December.",
      "A spokesperson for DHS said the information reported by CBS News is \"likely inaccurate,\" but did not offer a breakdown of criminality that was different to the numbers contained in the document.",
      "The spokesperson cited a press release that announced over 130 immigration arrests in the Charlotte area during the first two days of the operation, including 44 individuals who DHS said had criminal charges or convictions for aggravated assault, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault on a police officer, battery, driving under the influence and other crimes. Two of the detainees were identified as gang members in the release.",
      "The DHS document obtained by CBS News offers a window into the most recent operation led by outspoken and controversial Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has become the de facto on-the-ground enforcer of President Trump's clampdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the past months, the Trump administration has tasked Bovino and teams of Border Patrol agents with bringing its mass deportation campaign to several cities led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Chicago and, most recently, Charlotte. The deployment has been unprecedented in nature and scope. Border Patrol's work has been historically limited to stopping the illegal movement of people and drugs along the borders with Mexico and Canada, as well as some coastal regions.",
      "In Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, Border Patrol agents \u2014 in some cases accompanied by Bovino \u2014 have carried out arrests, often captured on social media videos, at Home Depot parking lots and other public areas, rounding up day laborers, landscapers and other immigrants they suspect are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The aggressive operations have fueled strong criticism from local elected officials, who have denounced Border Patrol's actions as harsh and indiscriminate, and accused agents of engaging in racial profiling, including against Hispanic U.S. citizens. Trump administration officials have rejected those accusations, saying use of force has been employed to protect agents and that arrests have been based on someone's illegal presence in the U.S., not their race.",
      "In the Charlotte area, Border Patrol agents were captured on video smashing the car window of a U.S. citizen, carrying out arrests outside of businesses and approaching men decorating a Christmas tree.",
      "Like in Chicago and Los Angeles, the operation in Charlotte triggered significant community backlash and concerns. Some businesses closed their doors temporarily. Local high school students staged walk-outs to protest the arrests. And school officials in the region reported tens of thousands of student absences.",
      "A CBS News poll released this past weekend found that 58% of Americans believed federal immigration agents were stopping and detaining \"more people than necessary.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests. The department cited concerns about the ability to properly vet people from Myanmar and the risk of them overstaying their visas, and said a number of TPS holders from that country were subject to national security or immigration fraud investigations.",
      "Federal government figures indicate there are currently 3,969 people enrolled in the Myanmar TPS program. Unless a court intervenes, the program will expire in late January.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposed-28-point-russia-ukraine-peace-plan/",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 12:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up territory and swear off NATO membership.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Ukraine said on Nov. 25 that it has agreed to \"the core terms\" of a peace deal\u00a0brokered by the U.S., amid ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi to work out remaining details. None of the changes to the Trump administration's original 28-point proposal\u00a0have been released. Read the latest here; our earlier story on the initial proposal is below.",
      "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war\u00a0\u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official.",
      "The 28-point plan is the most recent working document offered by the administration, reflecting feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, the White House official said. It still remains unclear whether both sides will agree to it; diplomatic conversations are ongoing and further changes are being negotiated, according to multiple sources.",
      "While some European governments were aware the U.S. was working on a proposal, they were not involved in drafting it, according to European officials contacted by CBS News.",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "The plan was also presented to a senior member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, Rustem Umerov, a White House official said. Umerov confirmed on\u00a0X\u00a0that he was party to the talks on a technical level but said, \"I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure.\"",
      "On Thursday, Zelenskyy met with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in Kyiv, and was presented with what he later characterized in a post on X as \"points of a plan to end the war \u2014 [America's] vision.\" Zelenskyy said he outlined Ukraine's key principles, and the two sides agreed to continue working on the plan's provisions. A White House official told CBS News that Driscoll had two hours of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including 45 minutes of direct talks with Zelenskyy, which they described as \"productive.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS News: \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after 5 years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"",
      "Here's how the proposed plan would work:",
      "Immediate ceasefire",
      "The plan says a ceasefire would take effect immediately if both sides agree to the deal.",
      "Ukraine expected to give up its eastern regions",
      "As written, the plan would allow Russia to hold onto much of the Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies \u2014 and take over some Ukrainian-held areas.",
      "The plan calls for the Ukrainian oblasts of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to be recognized by the U.S. and others as de facto Russian territory. Crimea was fully annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Russian military has occupied most of Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 collectively known as the Donbas \u2014 since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine were first occupied by Russian-aligned forces in 2014.",
      "Crucially, parts of Donetsk that are still under Ukrainian control would also be ceded to Russia, according to the proposal, but would be deemed a neutral buffer zone with no Russian military presence.",
      "The conflict would be frozen at the existing front lines in two other Ukrainian oblasts \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhia \u2014 effectively allowing Russia to hold onto cities like Mariupol and retain a land connection to Crimea.",
      "Those terms could prove to be a sticking point for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has long refused to give up any new territory or recognize Russian control over Crimea, instead calling for the war to be paused on the existing conflict lines.",
      "Ukraine must cap its military size",
      "The proposal also calls for Ukraine to cap the size of its military at 600,000 people.",
      "Zelensky said in January that the country's military numbered 880,000, according to the Kyiv Independent. Six years earlier, it had roughly 250,000 troops, the Atlantic Council said.",
      "No to NATO membership \u2014 but Ukraine can join the EU",
      "Under the plan, Ukraine would be barred from joining NATO.",
      "The country would be expected to modify its constitution to specify that it will not join the 32-nation bloc, a change of course since the country's NATO aspirations are currently enshrined in its constitution. Ukraine has pursued NATO membership for years, a status that would require the United States and other members to come to the country's defense if it's attacked again.",
      "And NATO is expected to agree not to accept Ukraine into the alliance. In 2008, its member states issued a declaration agreeing that Ukraine would become a member of NATO at some point in the future, but it did not set out a timeline.",
      "The plan also calls for NATO to agree not to send troops to Ukraine \u2014 possibly scuttling any postwar security deal that involves placing allied troops on Ukrainian soil.",
      "Another point in the plan says Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand any further \u2014 a favorable point for Russia, which has long chafed at the alliance's post-Cold War expansions. Sweden and Finland are the alliance's newest members, joining in 2024 and 2023, respectively, partly in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "NATO's longstanding position is that it has an \"open door policy,\" and decisions to admit new countries are made by its members, not any other countries.",
      "But the plan does specify that Ukraine has a right to join the European Union, and that it would get access to the European market in the meantime. Russia has long been wary of further economic and political integration between Ukraine and Europe.",
      "A U.S. guarantee",
      "The plan lays out a security guarantee if Russia reinvades Ukraine, calling for a \"decisive coordinated military response\" and the reinstatement of sanctions on Russia. Other benefits from the agreement, including recognition of new Russian territory, would be called off as well. The plan does not specify what type of military response Russia would face.",
      "The guarantee would be terminated if Ukraine invades Russia, or if it launches missiles at Moscow or St. Petersburg.",
      "Ukrainian elections",
      "Ukraine would be expected to hold elections in 100 days. Ukraine had elections scheduled for early 2024, but they were delayed due to the war. Zelenskyy won the presidency in 2019.",
      "Economic plan for Ukraine, Russian sanctions lifted",
      "The plan calls for a recovery plan for Ukraine, whose economy has been devastated by a yearslong Russian invasion and aerial bombardment. That includes reconstruction of Ukrainian cities, a development fund to boost Ukraine's tech industry and investments in mining and gas.",
      "Some $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be invested in Ukraine, with the U.S. leading that effort. Europe would contribute an additional $100 billion.",
      "The plan also calls for negotiations on lifting the hefty sanctions that Russia has faced since the invasion began, choking it off from much of the global economy. The sanctions would be lifted in stages, according to the framework. And frozen Russian assets beyond $100 billion would be plowed into a joint U.S.-Russia investment fund.",
      "The overall plan would be monitored and enforced by a Peace Council, to be chaired by President Trump.",
      "Other points in the plan include a Russia-NATO security dialogue, a joint U.S.-Russia security working group and a non-aggression pact between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. It would also extend U.S.-Russia arms control treaties, require Ukraine to be a non-nuclear state and bar Russia from blocking Ukraine from using the key Dnipro river for commercial purposes.",
      "All civilian detainees taken during the war would be returned, including children, and both sides in the conflict would be granted amnesty for their conduct during the war. And both countries would be expected to adopt educational programs to discourage racial prejudice.",
      "The plan also calls for a return of Russia to the Group of Eight, a grouping of powerful countries that kicked Russia out after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.",
      "Leavitt said in her statement: \"As the Trump Administration has clearly said, any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe, and Russia to ensure the end of the war, in addition to financial opportunities for Ukraine to rebuild, and for Russia to rejoin the global economy, to benefit the people in both countries.\"",

    "title": "Most dogs have wolf DNA. These breeds have more than others.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dogs-wolf-dna-breeds-study/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 07:13:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Wolf DNA seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, scientists said.",
    "story": [
      "Those tiny, fluffy dogs walking down the street may look cute but beware \u2014 they probably have some wolf in them.",
      "That is the discovery announced on Monday by U.S. scientists, who were surprised to find that nearly two thirds of all dog breeds have a detectable amount of wolf DNA.",
      "And it is not genetic leftovers from when dogs originally evolved from wolves around 20,000 years ago, but instead suggests that domesticated dogs and wild wolves have interbred within the last few thousand years.",
      "This does not mean that \"wolves are coming into your house and mixing it up with your pet dog,\" Logan Kistler, a curator at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "It also seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, the scientists said.",
      "\"The majority of dogs today have low, but detectable levels of post domestication wolf ancestry that has shaped their evolution and conferred unique advantages to their survival in diverse human environments,\" the scientists conclude in a study published on Monday.",
      "Dogs and wolves can produce offspring together, but interbreeding is thought to be rare.",
      "\"Prior to this study, the leading science seemed to suggest that in order for a dog to be a dog, there can't be very much wolf DNA present, if any,\" lead study author Audrey Lin of the American Museum of Natural History said in a statement.",
      "To find out more, the team analyzed thousands of dog and wolf genomes in publicly available databases.",
      "They found that over 64 percent of modern breeds have wolf ancestry, with even tiny chihuahuas carrying around 0.2 percent.",
      "\"This completely makes sense to anyone who owns a chihuahua,\" Lin joked.",
      "Which dogs have the most wolf DNA?",
      "Czechoslovakian and Saarloos wolfdogs had the most wolf DNA, with up to 40 percent.",
      "For breeds used as pets, the most \"wolfy\" was the Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore hound, with around five percent of wolf DNA. Sight hounds such as Salukis and Afghans also ranked high.",
      "While dogs with wolf DNA tended to be bigger, this was not always the case \u2014\u00a0Saint Bernards did not have any.",
      "The research also showed that 100 percent of village dogs \u2014 which live on human settlements but are not anyone's pet -- have wolf ancestry.",
      "Kistler speculated that village dogs, which have more opportunities to get intimate with wolves, could be how wolf DNA was getting into the dog gene pool.",
      "Female wolves separated from their wolf pack by human activities such as habitat destruction could end up breeding with stray dogs, he suggested.",
      "Overall, \"Arctic sled dogs, pariah breeds, and hunting dogs have the greatest wolf ancestry, while on average, terriers, gundogs, and scent hounds have the least,\" the researchers write.",
      "Friendly or territorial?",
      "The researchers also compared their findings to the terms that kennel clubs use to describe the personalities of different breeds.",
      "Breeds with little or no wolf in them were more likely to be described as friendly, easy to train and affectionate.",
      "On the other hand, dogs with more wolf DNA were more often considered to be suspicious of strangers, independent, dignified or territorial.",
      "However, researchers said some descriptors occurred with similar frequency in low wolf and high wolf-content dogs, including \"intelligent,\" \"obedient,\" \"good with children,\" \"dedicated,\" \"calm,\" and \"cheerful.\"",
      "Kistler emphasized that descriptions of breeds are imperfect and do not predict the behavior of any individual dog.",
      "\"Wolves are evolved for specific habitats and specific conditions, and dogs have been carried to every corner of the inhabited world by people,\" he said.",
      "Dogs have simply had to adapt to the places humans took them, and \"wolf genes that gave them advantages in certain contexts,\" he explained.",
      "For example, many Tibetan breeds, such as the fluffy little Lhasa Apso, have a gene called EPAS1 that came from adapting to higher altitudes. Tibetan wolves have the same gene.",
      "The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/moss-study-space-reproduce-earth/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:56:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",
      "In addition to surviving the 9-month period, the spores could still germinate after the experiment ended and scientists returned them back down to Earth, according to the study.",

    "summary": "Over the weekend, Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature that lets users see where an account is based \u2014 and it led to some surprises.",
    "story": [
      "They go by names like @TRUMP_ARMY\u2014 or @MAGANationX, and their verified accounts proudly display portraits of President Donald Trump, voter rallies and American flags. And they're constantly posting about U.S. politics to their followers, sounding like diehard fans of the president.",
      "But after a weekend update to the social media platform X, it's now clear that the owners of these accounts, and many others, are located in regions such as South Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe.",
      "Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature Saturday that lets users see where an account is based. Online sleuths and experts quickly found that many popular accounts posting in support of the MAGA movement to thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers, are based outside the United States \u2014 raising concerns about foreign influence on U.S. politics.",
      "Researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks online misinformation, identified several popular accounts \u2014 purportedly run by Americans interested in politics \u2014 that instead were based in Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa.",
      "The accounts were leading disseminators of some misleading and polarizing claims about U.S. politics, including ones that said Democrats bribed the moderators of a 2024 presidential debate.",
      "Nikita Bier, X's head of product, announced Saturday that the social media platform is rolling out an \"About This Account\" tool, which lets users see the country or region where an account is based. To find an account's location, tap or click the signup date displayed on the profile.",
      "\"This is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square. We plan to provide many more ways for users to verify the authenticity of the content they see on X,\" Bier wrote.",
      "In countries with punitive speech restrictions, a privacy tool on X lets account holders only show their region rather than a specific country. So instead of India, for instance, an account can say it is based in South Asia.",
      "Bier said Sunday that after an update to the tool, it would 99.99% accurate, though this could not be independently verified. Accounts, for instance, can use a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask their true location. On some accounts, there's a notice saying the location data may not be accurate, either because the account uses a VPN or because some internet providers use proxies automatically, without action by the user.",
      "\"Location data will always be something to use with caution,\" said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech and a former director of the International Fact-Checking Network. \"Its usefulness probably peaks now that it was just exposed, and bad actors will adapt. Meta has had similar information for a while and no one would suggest that misinformation has been eliminated from Facebook because of it.\"",
      "Some of the accounts supported slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as well as President Donald Trump's children. Many of the accounts were adorned with U.S. flags or made comments suggesting they were American. An account called \"@BarronTNews_,\" for instance, is shown as being located in \"Eastern Europe (Non-EU),\" even though the display location on its profile says \"Mar A Lago.\" The account, which has more than 580,000 followers, posted on Tuesday that \"This is a FAN account, 100 % independent, run by one guy who loves this country and supports President Trump with everything I've got.\"",
      "Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS News these types of accounts are fueled by public interest in current events and America's highly polarized politics.",
      "\"It is shining a light on this new rage economy that exists on social media, including X, that takes advantage of current things,\" Krebs said. \"What's the latest event? As we've seen over the last couple of years ... there has been a rightward shift of the platform. And I think what we're really seeing here is foreign-based accounts that are looking to make a little bit of money and taking advantage of this.\"",
      "He added, \"I think X deserves some credit to shine a light, to kind of expose some of these. ... I suspect you'll see a bunch of these accounts lose influence.\"",
      "NewsGuard also found evidence that some X users are spreading misinformation about the location feature itself, incorrectly accusing some accounts of being operated from abroad when they're actually used by Americans. Investigators found several instances where one user created fake screenshots that appear to suggest an account was created overseas.",
      "It's not always clear what the motives of the accounts. While some may be state actors, it's likely that many are financially motivated, posting commentary, memes and videos to draw engagement.",
      "\"For the most visible accounts unmasked this week, money is probably the main motivator,\" Mantzarlis said. \"That doesn't mean that X \u2014 as documented extensively by prior work done by academic and nonprofit organizations that are being attacked and defunded \u2014 isn't also a target for state actors.\"",
      "Users were divided over the new ability to see an account's location information, with some questioning whether it went too far.",
      "\"Isn't this kind of an invasion of privacy?\" One X user wrote. \"No one needs to see this info.\"",

      "The online retailer\u00a0agreed to the payouts in September\u00a0to resolve a 2023 Federal Trade Commission\u00a0lawsuit that accused Amazon of misleading customers into enrolling in Prime and making it hard for them to cancel their membership.",
      "Under the settlement, Amazon agreed to offer $1.5 billion in refunds to customers. However, the e-commerce company neither admitted nor denied the FTC's allegations. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time, the company said that \"Amazon and our executives have always followed the law.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Amazon refund, including how to determine if you qualify for the payment.",

      "Amazon is issuing settlement refunds to eligible Prime Members, starting with automatic payments issued between Nov. 12 and Dec. 24 (see below for more details on how payments are being made).",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 11:18:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Aviation experts worry that the recent government shutdown could make it hard for the U.S. to recruit a new generation of air traffic controllers.",
    "story": [
      "The government shutdown highlighted a fragile link in the nation's aviation system: finding enough air traffic controllers to keep flights on schedule. The 43-day closure, during which controllers were required to work without pay, has only heightened that challenge.",
      "\"It's a good job with good benefits, but partisan fighting over appropriations is not an ideal situation to try to bring in new air traffic controllers and convince them that this is a good career field,\" Tim Kiefer, a retired air traffic controller who is now a professor of air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told CBS News. \"It's not a positive to try to bring people into this industry by saying, 'You never know if you're not going to get paid.'\"",
      "The shutdown saw a spike in the number of controllers choosing to retire, according to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. The spectacle could also scare away younger workers from entering the field, Kiefer said.",
      "\"If you are a brand new person looking to enter a career, you may be thinking twice if you have to worry whether you're going to be paid or not. That may be a deterrent, and they might find another job because of that,\" he added.",
      "A spokesperson from the Department of Transportation told CBS News that \"the failure to pay air traffic controllers for 44 days created uncertainty, drove many experienced controllers out of the profession and harmed the recruitment pipeline.\"",
      "\"No one wants to enter a job where their paycheck could be held hostage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. had roughly\u00a011,700\u00a0certified professional controllers and certified controllers in training, leaving the nation some 4,000 short of the FAA's target staffing level. The agency expects to hire at least 8,900 new air traffic controllers through 2028, while nearly 7,000 are projected to leave over the same period.",
      "The FAA hit its hiring target in 2025, bringing in 2,026 new air traffic controllers, according to the agency.",
      "\"This administration is working all avenues from increasing starting salaries for controllers to streamlining the hiring process to effectively bring about the Golden Age of Travel and ensure America has the safest airspace in the world,\" the Transportation Department spokesperson said.",
      "What are the qualifications?",
      "On the FAA's website, Duffy describes controlling air traffic as \"one of the best, most rewarding \u00a0jobs in America.\" He also highlighted \"the urgent need to do all that we can to recruit more people to join in our shared mission of safety in our skies.\"",
      "Recruiting prospective air traffic controllers is one thing, but getting them to stick with the roughly four years of training required to be certified by the FAA is another matter, according to industry experts.",
      "\"The washout rate at various stages of the controller recruitment and training process is high,\" Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a group promoting libertarian principles, told CBS News.",
      "Before someone qualifies to train at the FAA's Air Traffic Controller Academy in Oklahoma City, Okla., job candidates must undergo a rigorous application process. To even apply through USAJobs, the federal government's official employment site, they must meet the following criteria:",
      "Be a U.S. citizenBe under the age of 31Pass the FAA air traffic pre-employment tests, including the Air Traffic Controller Specialists Skills Assessment Battery (ATSA)Speak English clearly enough to be understood over communications equipmentHave one year of progressively responsible work experience, or a Bachelor's degree, or a combination of at least one year of post-secondary education and work experience",

      "Pass the FAA air traffic pre-employment tests, including the Air Traffic Controller Specialists Skills Assessment Battery (ATSA)",
      "Speak English clearly enough to be understood over communications equipment",
      "Have one year of progressively responsible work experience, or a Bachelor's degree, or a combination of at least one year of post-secondary education and work experience",
      "Aspiring controllers must also pass an exam that the FAA\u00a0says\u00a0predicts candidates' \"aptitude to be an air traffic controller.\" Within a week, they are notified if they have passed.",
      "Stephen Abraham, a retired air traffic controller formerly based at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, told CBS News that the aptitude exam weeds out many job candidates.",
      "\"It's an assessment that determines if you have the right mental makeup to be an air traffic controller,\" he said, noting that people can not prepare or study for the test. \"If you succeed, they send you to Oklahoma City for eight to 12 weeks, where your training is more tailored toward success.\"",
      "Candidates who pass the test must then undergo comprehensive medical and background checks before they begin training at the academy. The medical red flags include using certain types of contact lenses to correct their vision, which is automatically disqualifying, and abnormal blood pressure.",
      "According to the FAA, fewer than 10% of applicants meet the agency's requirements to work as an air traffic controller and gain admission to the training program.",
      "How much do controllers earn?",
      "Once enrolled at the Oklahoma City academy, students spend months learning the basics of controlling the nation's airspace, such as understanding where to position planes on tabletop models of airports, Abraham explained. As they progress, they start using simulators to practice managing air traffic.",
      "Other training focuses on how to communicate with pilots and other controllers assigned to different parts of the airspace, as well as how to determine the best flight routes based on changing weather conditions and other factors.",
      "In time, trainees are assigned to an air traffic control facility, typically a control tower at a small airport with lighter plane traffic, where they spend an additional two to four years working as controllers under the supervision of more experienced staff.",
      "Joining the FAA academy isn't the only path to becoming a controller. Candidates can instead attend a college that offers an FAA-certified curriculum, and then proceed directly to on-the-job training.",
      "In 2024 (the last year for which federal data is available), the median annual wage for air traffic controllers was $144,580, according\u00a0to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "But pay varies widely based on experience and location. Annual income for less experienced controllers at smaller airports is closer to $60,000, according to aviation experts. Abraham said controllers' pay can rise as they rise to working at busier facilities, gain experience and get promoted.",
      "\"A lot of people get to that point, and when they are at their first facility, trying to learn to control real traffic, some just don't make it,\" Poole said. \"It's more stressful than being a pilot, who flies a route from point A to B mostly on autopilot.\"",

      "Garza said he informed his manager, J.D. Aupperle, about the comments on Jan. 10 and claims Aupperle did not encourage him to report the incident to human resources.",
      "Garza was then \"abruptly terminated from employment\" just weeks later, the lawsuit says. The discussion between Garza and Bally was recorded, according to Detroit television station WDIV.",

President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act\u00a0allocated $8.5 billion for the U.S. to acquire icebreaking ships on an expedited basis, the department said, adding that a \"workforce development plan\" has been implemented \"to support the creation of a skilled workforce capable of designing and constructing complex icebreaking vessels.\"",
      "Homeland Security emphasized that insufficient polar icebreaking abilities could mean \"ceding control\" of the Arctic, \"leading to heightened security concerns, restricted access to Arctic shipping routes, loss of valuable resources and diminished influence in shaping future Arctic policy.\"",
      "Chinese research ships appeared more often in U.S. territory in the Arctic this year than they had in years' past, the Coast Guard has said. In August, the agency shared its plans to expand its crews in U.S. Arctic waters as part of an effort to address \"increased activity\" by Chinese research vessels in that area.",
      "That announcement came on the heels of another from the Coast Guard, which said in July that another China-flagged research ship had been detected off the coast of Alaska, in the North American Arctic. Coast Guard crews monitored the ship's movements alongside the Canadian military, Canada's CBC News reported at the time.",

The bay is on the grounds of the Pacific Missile Range Facility, where Diaz was stationed.",

      "\"From what my son said, he was in the middle of the ocean and his dad was swimming with one arm trying to get him to safety,\" Fairley told HawaiiNewsNow. \"Then he got on his dad's back and swam for a little bit and then my son said that Jeff told him, 'Ok bub, you're going to have to get off my back. I'm going to drown. I want you to go. I want you to swim. Don't stop. You got this. Don't give up. I love you.' That was the last words he heard from his dad.\"",
      "Fairley and the police said both children made it safely back to shore.",
      "First responders received a report of a swimmer in distress at around 3 p.m. local time. Responders recovered Diaz from the ocean and began lifesaving efforts.

    "story": [
      "Big Stone Gap, Va. \u2014 A Virginia high school football coach who disappeared days before his undefeated team's playoff game is being sought on charges of possessing child pornography and using a computer to solicit a minor, Virginia State Police said Tuesday.",
      "Police said Travis L. Turner, 46, of Appalachia, Virginia, is wanted on warrants obtained Monday for five counts of each charge, adding that additional charges are pending as an investigation continues. They did not share details about what prompted the charges.",
      "Turner has been missing since last Thursday, when state police special agents from a Bureau of Criminal Investigation office were sent to his home, not to arrest him but to talk to him as part of an investigation. As officers traveled there they were notified that he was gone, police said. The subsequent search nearby has included drones, dogs and rescue teams, police said.",
      "Speaking on behalf of the Turner family, attorney Adrian Collins said in a statement that, \"We remain prayerful for his safe return and for everyone affected by the circumstances surrounding his disappearance. We trust God to bring truth and clarity in His time. Any allegations should be addressed through the proper legal process\u2014not through speculation or rumor. We ask the public and media to show compassion, accuracy, and respect for the family's privacy.\"",
      "Wise County Public Schools said in a statement that Turner \"remains on leave and is not permitted on school property or to have contact with students. The division will continue to cooperate with law enforcement as this process moves forward.\"",
      "Turner had winning football record",
      "Turner is the football coach at Union High School in southwest Virginia's Wise County. Union has strung together 12 straight wins to remain undefeated this season and advance to a regional final this Saturday.",
      "Before coaching Union's team, Turner was a quarterback at Appalachia High School, which merged into Union High School in 2011. His father, Tom Turner, was also his high school football coach. Tom Turner was inducted into the Virginia High School Hall of Fame in 2005.",
      "Online records indicate Travis Turner was in Virginia Tech's 1998 recruiting class alongside future NFL quarterback Michael Vick, and also went on to play football at University of Virginia Wise in 1999.",
      "Defensive coordinator Jason Edwards stepped in as interim head coach in Union's victory over Graham last weekend, according to the Bristol Herald Courier, which also reported that Bears players didn't want to talk afterward about the situation involving Turner.",
      "Asked about Turner, Division Superintendent Mike Goforth told the AP in an emailed statement that Wise County Public Schools is aware of charges filed \"against a staff member who has been on administrative leave\" and that the person isn't allowed to be on school property or have contact with students. He didn't disclose when or why that leave began, and said school officials wouldn't comment further because it's an ongoing legal matter involving personnel.",

One brought wet weather over the Ohio Valley before reaching the Northeast later in the day, while the second is expected to produce strong winds and heavy snowfall across a northern band of the Midwest, from the Plains through the Great Lakes, through Wednesday.",
      "Winter storm warnings were in effect for parts of North Dakota, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

The area could see up to 5 inches of snow by Wednesday morning, with some places forecast to receive as much as 8 inches. Blowing snow and biting cold will impact\u00a0travel conditions\u00a0Wednesday, with slick roads, slower commutes and a spike in crashes expected.

      "The impacts of this week's winter weather will be most severe in areas closest to the Canadian border, where some places could receive 20 or 30 inches of snow, Nolan said, adding that high winds across the upper Midwest could potentially reach 40 mph, with even stronger gusts. That could possible interrupt travel along major interstates, including I-29, I-90 and I-94, as well as major airports in Chicago, Duluth, Fargo, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Pierre, South Dakota.",

      "\"I carry him in my heart every day,\" she said, while trying to find the words to describe the wave of emotions that washed over her Monday when she learned that federal authorities had charged three people in connection with her son's killing on the Navajo Nation in 2020.",
      "She had waited so long for answers, telling herself with each new year that she would finally see justice for her 23-year-old son. Her wait ended as the U.S. Department of Justice announced the results of the latest deployment under Operation Not Forgotten.",
      "Under the operation this year, more than 60 extra FBI agents, analysts and other personnel were temporarily assigned to field offices in 10 states, ranging from Albuquerque and Phoenix to Seattle, Salt Lake City, Detroit, Minneapolis and Jackson, Mississippi. Over six months, they investigated unsolved violent crimes in Indian Country with the goal of addressing a crisis of disappearances and killings that have left Native American communities frustrated and heartbroken.",
      "Federal statistics show that Native Americans experience some of the highest per capita rates of violent victimization of any racial or ethnic group in the United States. Indigenous women go missing and are murdered\u00a0at disproportionately high rates\u00a0in the U.S. and Canada, compared with other groups, and experts say the crisis is rooted in\u00a0historical wrongs.",
      "At the beginning of the 2025 fiscal year, the FBI's Indian Country program had about 4,300 open investigations, including over 900 death investigations, 1,000 child abuse investigations, and more than 500 domestic violence and adult sexual abuse investigations.",
      "\"We will never forget the crime victims whose cases remain unsolved, and we will continue our pursuit until justice is served,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.",

      "\"One of the biggest problems tribal communities face is the vast amount of land to account for, requiring significant resources to crush violent crime,\" Patel said in a statement.",
      "Work to bring more attention to the crisis has spanned decades. President Donald Trump was the first president to formally recognize the issue when he signed an executive order during his first term, establishing a task force to tackle the high rate of killings and disappearances among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland during her tenure created a national commission to explore ways to bridge jurisdictional gaps and other challenges to curbing crime in tribal communities.",
      "Officials said this year's operation marked the longest and most intense deployment of FBI resources to date to address Indian Country crime.",
      "Advocates say the investment should be made permanent. They fear now that cases will continue to sit on the back burner with fewer federal resources in the field.",
      "Randall-Shorty believes the extra resources helped in her son's case.",
      "She can't help but wonder what her son could have accomplished had his life not been taken. A father himself, Zachariah Shorty loved art and music and aspired to be a tattoo artist. She showed off some of his work, pointing to the inked treble clef on her left hand.",
      "Shorty was last seen at the Journey Inn Motel in the northwestern New Mexico city of Farmington, where he was out with friends to make music, his mom said. He was found days later in a field near the Navajo community of Nenahnezad. He had been shot multiple times.",

      "Austin Begay, 31, is charged with first-degree murder, while Jaymes Fage, 38, is accused of aiding and abetting. Both Navajo men and a third defendant, 40-year-old Joshua Watkins, also face charges for lying to investigators to conceal the killing.",
      "Shorty's mom has spent the last five years attending town halls, task force meetings, prayer circles and community marches to keep the case in the spotlight and to advocate for other families. While she's pleased that charges have been brought, she knows the next step will stir more emotions because she still misses her son.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday the National Park Service is going to start charging the millions of international tourists who visit U.S. national parks each year $100 per person to enter some of the most popular sites, while leaving them out of fee-free days that will be reserved for American residents.",
      "The fee change for international visitors will impact 11 national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, according to the Interior Department.",
      "As part of the changes, which are set to take effect Jan. 1, foreign tourists will also see their annual parks pass price jump to $250, while U.S. residents will continue to be charged $80, according to the department's statement.",
      "Only approximately 100 of the more than 400 parks in the national park system collect an entrance fee.",
      "The announcement declaring \"America-first entry fee policies\" comes as national parks deal with the strain of a major staff reduction and severe budget cuts, along with recovering from damage during the recent government shutdown and significant lost revenue due to fees not being collected during that time. The park service furloughed well over half its staff during the shutdown.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a post on the social platform X that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers who support the park service \"continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!\"",
      "A White House social media post laying out the increased fees ended with the phrase, \"AMERICANS FIRST.\"",
      "The announcement follows a July executive order in which President Donald Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump also ordered the Interior Department to give U.S. residents \"preferential treatment\" over foreign visitors regarding \"recreational access rules, including permitting or lottery rules\" that parks might have in place.",
      "In its 2026 fiscal year\u00a0budget proposal\u00a0released in May, the Interior Department estimated that such a surcharge on international visitors would generate more than $90 million annually.",
      "\"There's a lot to unpack in this announcement, including many questions on its implementation \u2013 all which NPCA will raise with the Department of Interior,\" Kati Schmidt, a spokesperson for National Parks Conservation Association, said in an email.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association estimated that in 2018, national parks and monuments saw more than 14 million international visitors. Yellowstone reported that in 2024, nearly 15% of its visitors were from outside the country, which was down from 30% in 2018.",
      "The money made off the new fees will help support the national parks, including with upgrading facilities for visitors and maintenance, according to the statement.",
      "The \"resident-only patriotic fee-free days\" next year include Veterans Day, which was one of the parks' eight free days open to everyone in 2025. The Department of the Interior had announced those days by saying they wanted to ensure that \"everyone, no matter their zip code, can access and enjoy the benefits of green spaces and our public lands.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:42:00 -0500",
    "summary": "U.S. Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia has agreed to pay nearly $5.2 million in overdue personal taxes.",
    "story": [
      "Republican Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia has agreed to pay nearly $5.2 million in overdue personal taxes, the latest saga for the former billionaire who has been followed by a trail of financial challenges going back well over a decade.",
      "An attorney for Justice and his wife, Cathy, entered into a joint motion for consent judgment with the federal government on Monday, the same day the government filed a lawsuit saying the couple \"have neglected or refused to make full payment\" for the income taxes dating to 2009. An attorney for the Justice Department's tax division signed off on the agreement.",
      "Justice had a fortune estimated at $1.9 billion last decade by Forbes magazine, which stripped his billionaire title in 2021, when Justice's worth had dwindled to an estimated $513 million. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated that Justice's net worth had disintegrated to \"less than zero\" due to liabilities that far exceeded assets.",
      "A spokesperson for Justice's office didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.",
      "During a briefing with local media in October, Justice asserted that his companies \"are complicated and complex\" and that his children \"are doing a magnificent job\" running them. He then repeated past assertions that collection efforts against him were politically motivated, before concluding: \"At the end of the day, I'd say just let it be and see how it all plays out.\"",
      "Justice, a former two-term governor who owns dozens of businesses that include coal and agricultural operations, was elected last November to the Senate. He took over the seat vacated by the retiring Joe Manchin, a Democrat who became an independent in 2024 near the end of his second full term.",
      "Justice still has other financial challenges to work out.",
      "The Internal Revenue Service last month filed liens totaling more than $8 million against Justice and his wife on unpaid personal taxes. In September, state tax officials filed $1.4 million in liens against the Justice family's historic hotel, The Greenbrier, and the resort's Greenbrier Sporting Club, over unpaid sales taxes.",
      "Last month, a foreclosure auction on several hundred lots owned by the Justice family at a resort community near Beckley was paused. The auction centered on a dispute between the Glade Springs Village Property Owners Association and Justice Holdings over unpaid fees. The state Supreme Court plans to review the case more closely.",
      "In 2021, the IRS filed liens over $1.1 million in unpaid taxes on the Greenbrier Hotel and an additional $80,000 on the resort's medical clinic. Those debts were paid off later that year.",
      "Justice's family settled debts last year in a separate case to avoid the Greenbrier Hotel's foreclosure. The 710-room hotel, which has hosted U.S. presidents, royalty and congressional retreats, had come under threat of being auctioned off on the steps of a Lewisburg courthouse. That was after JPMorgan Chase sold a longstanding loan taken out by Justice to a credit collection company, Beltway Capital, which declared it to be in default.",
      "The state Democratic Party has said efforts to seize the hotel from Justice were \"a direct consequence of his own financial incompetence.\"",
      "Last year, a union official at the Greenbrier said that Justice's family was at least $2.4 million behind in payments to an employees' health insurance fund, putting workers' coverage at risk. In 2023, dozens of properties owned by the Justice family in three counties were auctioned as payment for delinquent real estate taxes. Others have sought to recoup millions in fines for environmental issues and unsafe working conditions at his company's coal mines.",
      "Justice bought The Greenbrier resort out of bankruptcy in 2009 for $20.1 million. The sporting club is a private equity club and residential community on the property that opened in 2000.",
      "The resort in White Sulphur Springs that dates to 1778 also has a casino, spa and dozens of amenities and employs around 2,000 workers. The resort held a PGA Tour golf tournament from 2010 until 2019 and has welcomed NFL teams for training camp and practices. A once-secret 112,000-square-foot underground bunker built for Congress at the Greenbrier in case of nuclear attack during the Cold War now hosts tours.",

    "summary": "Burt Meyer's creations arrived in the postwar boom, when plastic molding and mass production transformed how American kids played.",
    "story": [
      "Burt Meyer, who invented toys like Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, Lite-Brite and Mouse Trap in the 1960s that delighted generations of children, has died. He was 99.",
      "Meyer's creations arrived in the postwar boom, when plastic molding and mass production transformed how American kids played. That shift opened the door for more dynamic toys, and Meyer seized the moment with designs that would stay on shelves for decades.",
      "Meyer died on Oct. 30, said Rebecca Mathis, executive director at King-Bruwaert House, a retirement community in Burr Ridge, Illinois, where he lived.",
      "Meyer succeeded by straddling two often conflicting worlds, carrying a boundless childlike imagination alongside a pragmatic understanding of machines.",
      "The idea for Lite-Brite came in 1966 when Meyer was walking in Manhattan with Marvin Glass, who owned one of the largest toy design companies at the time, and the two men passed a window display featuring hundreds of colored lights. Engineers at the company doubted that electric lights could be safely adapted for children, according to Tim Walsh, who interviewed Meyer for his 2005 book \"Timeless Toys.\"",
      "Meyer, an employee at Marvin Glass & Associates, insisted it could.",
      "\"There's billions of ideas out there,\" Walsh wrote, \"but executing them into a final creative solution is often the hard part.\"",
      "Meyer came up with a small backlit box and black paper sheets that allowed kids to create illuminated patterns. Lite-Brite was a hit, earning spots on Time Magazine's list of 100 greatest toys and in the Strong National Museum of Play's hall of fame. New versions are still being sold.",
      "Meyer had a similar role with a design team that reimagined a bulky boxing arcade game for home use. The original concept stalled in development after a featherweight boxer died from a brain injury, making any toy that invoked the tragedy unmarketable, company leaders thought.",
      "Meyer revisited the idea with a simple shift. \"This is too good to pass up,\" he recalled saying in a 2010 interview. \"Let's take it away from humanity, let's make it robots. And we won't have them fall over, we'll have something funny happen.\"",
      "The result was Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, a small game where players control the fighters' fists by pressing buttons on joysticks. A player wins by hitting the jaw of the opposing robot, theatrically popping up the spring-loaded head.",
      "The toy remained recognizable to later generations, appearing in the film \"Toy Story 2,\" and the toy company Mattel announced plans in 2021 for a live-action movie adaptation.",
      "Meyer launched his own firm, Meyer/Glass Design, in the mid-1980s. The company developed numerous bestsellers including Gooey Louie, where children picked boogers out of Louie's nose, and the Pretty Pretty Princess board game. His son, Steve Meyer, ran the business until 2006, according to The New York Times.",
      "Born in 1926 as Burton Carpenter Meyer, he enlisted in the Navy and served for two years as an aircraft mechanic. After retiring from toy making, he moved to Downers Grove, a suburb of Chicago, where he built small planes and could be seen deftly steering them aloft from a nearby private airfield well into his 80s.",
      "In interviews, Meyer often drew parallels between aerospace engineering and toy design, saying both required ingenuity and teamwork.",
      "\"When you're flying the airplane, use every resource that you have in there. That's why we were able to turn out so many successful products,\" Meyer said, crediting his success to the highly collaborative environment at Marvin Glass & Associates.",
      "Meyer's car had a vanity plate that said TOYKING, and by most accounts, he was. In a 2010 interview, he said he was still delighted by telling people what he did for a living, and having them respond: \"Oh, I played with that!\"",

    "story": [
      "Editor's note: On July 21, 2025, a federal appeals court ruled that Pedro Hernandez must have a new trial or be released.  On Nov. 25, 2025, the Manhattan District Attorney announced he intends to retry Hernandez.",
      "This story originally aired on April 14, 2018.",
      "Etan Patz walked out of his New York City home headed for a school bus stop just two blocks away. The 6-year-old never made it to school that day in 1979 \u2013 and he's never been found.",
      "His disappearance is a story that shocked New York City and to this day haunts law enforcement investigators who have spent decades trying to find him. The disappearance of the young boy is more than a missing person's case. Indeed, it changed the way parents watched over their kids.",
      "\"I think this was one of the most significant unsolved cases in the history of New York City,\" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. tell \"48 Hours\" correspondent Richard Schlesinger.",
      "\"Every missing child case is very important, but this was one of the oldest ones we had,\" says NYPD Lieutenant Chris Zimmerman.",
      "Etan Patz disappeared at a time long before social media and every storefront had a video camera. He had asked his parents to let him do the short walk to the bus stop alone for the first time. He had a dollar to buy a soda at a corner deli. His parents were unaware he was missing until he didn't return home after school. Since then, Patz's smiling image used on missing person's fliers is seared into the minds of people around the country.",
      "\"That photo will always haunt me. And every single day that I sent my son out to school, I thought of Etan Patz,\" says attorney Brian O'Dwyer. \"And I was one of eight million New Yorkers like that.\"",
      "Police began searching for Patz by going door to door. Over the years, the case would grow cold. But there was one neighborhood man police suspected of being a pedophile, whom they had their eye on almost from the beginning: Jose Ramos. Ramos, according to law enforcement, had said he took a child back to his apartment and molested him. Ramos told them he was 90 percent sure it was Patz. The case against Ramos, however, lacked corroboration, and never moved forward, says Vance.",
      "Vance vowed to take a fresh look at Etan's disappearance when he took office in 2010. \"I was on the hunt for the Patz family to find the killer,\" he says.",
      "Then in 2012, the NYPD got a tip from a relative of Pedro Hernandez, saying Hernandez had talked about hurting a boy around the time Patz disappeared. During questioning by police, Hernandez told them he choked a boy. He later took them to locations near the Patz home. Was Hernandez telling the truth?",
      "\"The facts of that confession make no sense,\" says Hernandez's attorney Harvey Fishbein. \"He's unreliable because of his psychiatric condition.\"",
      "What happened to Etan Patz?",
      "THE SEARCH FOR ETAN",
      "After more than 30 years, it took a new team of investigators and a new prosecutor to breathe new life into an old case \u2013 trying to find out what happened to Etan Patz.",
      "District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.:\u00a0 You really should never close the book on a case if you think there's the possibility that it can be solved.",
      "In 2012, investigators were literally digging for clues just blocks away from where Etan was last seen. \u00a0After thousands of dead-end leads, the public held its collective breath hoping, this time, the case might finally be solved.",
      "Etan Patz was just 6 years old, and like many kids that age, he wanted some independence. It was 1979, the last day of school before the Memorial Day weekend, and Etan's mother, Julie, finally agreed to let Etan walk alone to the school bus stop. It was just two blocks away from their Manhattan apartment.",
      "Julie Patz | Etan's mother [1980]: Yes, I wish I hadn't let him go to the bus stop that morning alone. \u2026My feelings that morning were very positive about his going.",
      "Etan was carrying a book bag and a dollar to buy a soda at a corner store near the bus stop \u2013 and then, he seemed to vanish.",
      "Julie and her husband Stan didn't realize their son was missing until that afternoon when he didn't come home from school. Julie called the school and learned Etan never arrived and his friends never saw him at the bus stop. So she called the police.",

      "Etan's image was splashed on storefronts and in newspapers. Etan's father is a professional photographer and took many photos of his son. The pictures captured the public's heart\u2014and captured Etan's spirit.",
      "Julie Patz [1980]: He's just bubbling over with life and \u2026 He always saw the positive side when other people saw negative.\u00a0 He is just an incredible person.",
      "Stan Patz [1980]: Our 6-year-old boy's a loving, trusting child. \u2026We think an adult could have convinced him to come with him.",
      "The police canvassed the neighborhood, talking to people on the street and interviewing workers at a corner store near the school bus stop.",
      "Det. Bill Butler [1980]: The longer we've gone without any bad news, I think that's good.",
      "Detective Bill Butler was Eanniello's partner.",
      "Det. Bill Butler [1980]: We have leads, but we don't know where we're gonna end up on the leads that we have now.",
      "Det. Bill Butler [1980]: When you go this long on something like this, you do, you feel like you're looking for your own son.",
      "The search for Etan dragged on. Detective Butler, a father with six children, lived and breathed the case.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: How did this case influence Bill Butler?",
      "Patrick Eanniello: More than I could imagine. He was very, very tied into the case.",
      "In 1986, Bill Butler took his own life. There was speculation Butler's frustration with this case may have been part of the reason why.",
      "The search went on without Butler. Julie and Stan had two other children to protect: Etan's older sister and younger brother.",
      "Julie Patz [1980]: We keep saying we try to lead normal lives, but in so many small ways, it's just totally impossible, I mean we have his belongings all over the house \u2026 And yet to put them away is saying to us and our children he's gone and not coming back.",
      "Stan Patz [1980]: And if we are patient we'll get him back.",
      "But their patience went unrewarded.",
      "The Patz's did everything they could to keep their story in the news. And that helped other missing children.",
      "In the 1980s, milk cartons showed Etan's face, and then, those of others. But Etan remained among the missing.",
      "By 1998, a new detective was heading the Missing Persons Squad. Phil Mahony was drawn to the case by, of all things, a poem titled \"The Missing Boy\" by Sharon Olds -- about a mother and son looking at Etan's missing poster.",
      "Phil Mahony: And -- I read that poem and I said, [snaps fingers] \"That's it. \u2026I wanna work on the Etan Patz case.",

      "Ramos told that story to Federal Prosecutor Stuart GraBois, who had been working the case since 1985. GraBois and the FBI had, through the years, tracked leads around the world. But they always came back to Ramos.",
      "Stuart GraBois: In June 1988, Ramos was brought to my office \u2026 and proceeded to state \u2026 that he was 90 percent sure that the young boy he took that day, May 25,1979, was the same boy whose picture he saw both in the newspaper and on television\u00a0 -- \u00a0that being Etan Patz.",

      "It would be a wrongful death suit. O'Dwyer hoped Ramos would be subpoenaed and might say something incriminating to help bring a criminal case. But before the wrongful death case could proceed, O'Dwyer had to ask the Patz's to officially give up hope. They would have to ask a court to declare their son dead.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: It's one of the toughest things I've ever done in my practice.",

      "From the time Etan disappeared in 1979 until 2009, one man held the position of Manhattan District Attorney: Robert Morgenthau. He never felt there was enough evidence to indict Ramos. But Morgenthau was retiring, and Cyrus Vance Jr. was running for the office.",
      "Cyrus Vance Jr.: The Patz family reached out to me. \u2026And Stan \u2026 asked me if I would -- look into the case.",
      "And when Vance became Manhattan D.A. in 2010, he did look into it.",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: Cy Vance was like, \"Listen, we'd like to re -- you know, fresh set of eyes, relook at it, go backwards, see what was missed.\"",

      "The FBI had been involved on and off since Etan's disappearance.\u00a0 In April 2012, investigators took another look at a handyman who used to work for the Patz's. Along with the NYPD, they started that dig. It was at the former site of the handyman's workshop.",

      "The dig went on for five days, as investigators sifted through subterranean spaces and decades-old dirt. It was starting to look like there might finally be some answers. In the end, nothing was found. The handyman was cleared. But this was not just another dead end \u2013 it was far from it. In fact, it led to the first major turning point in this case.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: The call comes into our office, onto the phone right next to my desk.",

And soon after, Hernandez left that job and moved home to New Jersey. \u00a0Over the years, he had been divorced, remarried and had children. He worked on and off at menial jobs and had no criminal record. But he had told people about hurting an unnamed child.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: So who had Hernandez spoken to?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: There was a religious group, apparently there was a retreat that they had gone on \u2026 they all had \u2013 information \u2026 to the fact that Mr. Hernandez did something to this child.",

      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: I don't have the answer for it. I wasn't there. You know, I -- I never got clarity on that and I don't think he did either.",
      "About two weeks after they learned about Hernandez, on May 23, 2012, police went to his New Jersey home to talk to him.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: I had -- told him that we were investigating an old \u2026 missing persons case \u2026 in New York City. \u2026At that point, he like, he lost all the color in his face.",

      "Det. Dave Ramirez: No, no.",

    "summary": "The FBI has ruled the woman out as a suspect in the 2021 plot, sources said, but only after her name circulated on social platforms and a conservative news site.",
    "story": [
      "A federal security officer linked to a thwarted Jan. 6 pipe bomb attack cleared her name by providing an alibi: video of her playing with her puppies at the time the devices were placed, sources told CBS News. The FBI has now ruled her out as a suspect in the 2021 plot, according to three sources \u2014 but only after her name circulated on social platforms and a conservative news site.",
      "How an innocent woman's name came to be publicly linked to the unexploded pipe bombs is a question that has raised concerns among some senior officials in the Trump administration.",
      "CBS News is not naming the security officer or her workplace. The federal agency she protects declined to comment.",
      "Multiple sources said that a unit overseen by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard drafted a memo identifying the woman and describing allegations that she had placed the explosive devices outside Democratic and Republican party offices. The memo was written after ODNI was made aware of allegations from an outside source, an ODNI spokesperson said.",
      "ODNI officials said the agency received a tip from a person affiliated with a media organization about potential criminal wrongdoing by an individual believed to be working at an intelligence agency and set about documenting it in a memo.",
      "A copy of the unfinished memo was given to senior staff at the security officer's workplace, sources said.",
      "It also circulated among a few Trump administration officials, building expectations that the nearly five-year-old case might be solved. But the memo caught some officials at the FBI, Justice Department and White House off guard, the sources said.",
      "ODNI oversees the nation's foreign intelligence gathering and has limited domestic investigative authorities. The FBI is leading the pipe bomb investigation.",
      "A short time after the unfinished memo began to circulate, the conservative news outlet, Blaze News, published details similar to those in the draft, including the woman's full name.",
      "The Nov. 8 Blaze News article claimed that it had pinpointed the woman after a review of video evidence and \"gait analysis\" software matched her walking pattern to the gait of a person shown in surveillance footage, who authorities suspect planted bombs outside the party offices on Jan. 5, 2021.",
      "Blaze News said its work had been \"confirmed by several intelligence sources.\"",
      "Several sources told CBS News that the classified draft memo, which was on ODNI letterhead, was written by Paul McNamara, who is in charge of Gabbard's Director's Initiatives Group, which is tasked with providing \"transparency and accountability\" and executing President Trump's intelligence-related executive orders. McNamara could not be reached for comment.",
      "A spokesperson, Olivia Coleman, said, \"ODNI followed its obligation to report information received concerning the alleged activities of a member of the Intelligence Community to that person's employing agency.\"",
      "\"After a whistleblower came forward with an allegation, ODNI documented the accusation and lawfully reported it, fulfilling our legal duty to alert appropriate agencies when alleged/potential security concerns are brought to our attention,\" Coleman said. \"There were no predetermined conclusions or assessments made, and every action taken was done so in consultation with legal counsel.\"",
      "The Blaze report became the subject of extensive media coverage and discussion on social media, especially among supporters of Mr. Trump.",
      "Word of this supposed break in the case reached Mr. Trump, two of the sources said, although it's unclear how he learned of it.",
      "The bomb-planting incident is one of the lingering mysteries surrounding the events around the Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021, on the eve of the Jan. 6 riot. Nearly five years since the pipe bombs were placed, no suspect has been arrested or identified. The FBI said the bombs were viable, but they did not detonate.",
      "CBS News was not shown the memo, but sources said McNamara had accessed confidential files to obtain details about the woman for the draft memo, including her place of work and Social Security number.",
      "Gabbard, the top ODNI official, has since distanced herself from the memo, telling senior officials that the information about the woman spread without her knowledge while Gabbard was traveling abroad, several sources said.",
      "An ODNI official also said the draft memo hadn't been reviewed or approved by agency leadership.",
      "Sources said this situation, and others, were viewed internally by some senior administration officials as interfering in areas that were beyond the purview of the national intelligence director's office. Axios reported in September that Justice Department officials believed ODNI had hindered their case against former CIA Director John Brennan. The New York Times in October reported that ODNI had accessed FBI investigative files related to Charlie Kirk's assassination, searched for evidence of conspiracies and potentially undermined the government's case against the alleged assassin.",
      "The federal security officer cooperated with the FBI, sources close to the matter said. Her lawyer said publicly she had done nothing wrong. Both the woman and her lawyer declined to comment.",
      "She returned to work after being placed on a brief leave, one of the sources said.",
      "An FBI spokesperson and representatives for Blaze News didn't respond to requests for comment. Blaze News updated its story with one correction and further information, but it remains online.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:49:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Past-due balances are becoming a reality for many U.S. households as they struggle to keep up with costlier utility bills.",
    "story": [
      "Americans' energy bills are piling up, forcing them deeper into debt and even triggering power shutoffs.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 households went into collections or fell in arrears on their utility bills, according to a new\u00a0joint report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The problem was even more pronounced in parts of the South and Appalachia, where one in 12 households was already in collections or on the verge of it.",
      "In the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the report found.",
      "More Americans are falling behind on their utility payments due to\u00a0rising energy prices, alongside a jump in costs for other essentials, ranging from child care to housing.",
      "\"When we see families unable to pay their utility bills, it raises alarm bells about a crisis of home heating and electricity, but it also raises alarm bells about people's ability to deal with their cost of living across the board,\" said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation.",
      "Residential electricity prices rose by 10.5% between January and August 2025, one of the fastest increases in a decade, government data analyzed by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), an educational and policy organization, shows. Natural gas is still the most popular way Americans heat their homes, although a growing\u00a0share are using electricity.",
      "A combination of high interest rates, rising natural gas costs and an increase in demand from data centers has pushed up prices, according to NEADA.",
      "The issue will likely come into sharper focus this winter when millions of consumers face heating bills. NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.",
      "More Americans at risk of shutoffs",
      "When people fail to pay their energy bills on time, it can lead to electricity shutoffs, or when a utility turns off a household's power until people pay the balance, along with a so-called reconnection fee.",
      "Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all. States without cold-weather protection include Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, according to the Energy Justice Lab, a joint project of Indiana University and the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Despite these protections, Americans are becoming increasingly vulnerable to shutoffs, experts told CBS News.",
      "While no official national count of utility cutoffs exists, NEADA estimates that 3.5 million American households had their power cut off at some point in 2024 based on public data reported by utility companies. That number is expected to swell to 4 million this year, NEADA estimates.",
      "\"Past due balances climbing, particularly for lower-income families, suggest that shutoffs are going to become much more prevalent,\" the Century Foundation's Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Con Edison, a utility serving New York City and Westchester County in New York, has cut off almost 168,000 customers at some point this year, according to data NEADA shared with CBS News. That's more than five times the number of shutoffs the utility reported last year.",
      "Most Americans whose power is cut off have services restored within a few days, according to Mark Wolfe, NEADA's executive director. Still, the shutoffs can create major disruptions to Americans' day-to-day lives as they lose refrigeration, internet and lighting. Pipes can also freeze, and residents could get sick if their apartments get too cold, Wolfe added.",
      "Shutoffs tend to have a bigger impact on low-income households, given they are already stretched thin by everyday expenses, Wolfe said. Many turn to payday lenders, friends and family or state forgiveness plans to cover reconnection costs or overdue bills, he added.",
      "\"When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,\" Wolfe told CBS News. \"That flexibility gives them a small sense of control, but it also increases the risk of falling behind and facing shutoffs.\"",

    "story": [
      "Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te announced a $40 billion budget for arms purchases on Wednesday. The plans include building an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome, as the U.S. pressures the island to increase its defense spending.",
      "According to the leader, this budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Lai already pledged to raise defense spending to 5% of the island's GDP, as part of his strategy amid China's threats of invasion.",
      "\"China's threats to Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific region are escalating,\" Lai said on Wednesday. \"Recently, various types of military intrusions, maritime gray zones and disinformation campaigns have been occurring in Japan, the Philippines and around the Taiwan Strait, causing deep unease and distress to all parties in the region.\"",
      "\"Taiwan, as the most important and most critical part of the first island chain, must demonstrate our determination and take on a greater responsibility in self-defense,\" he said, referring to the string of islands stretching from Japan's East China Sea through the Philippines in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Last week, Japan said that it\u00a0scrambled aircraft after detecting a suspected Chinese drone near its southern island of Yonaguni, which is close to Taiwan.",
      "Currently, Taiwan has set an increase in its defense budget to 3.3% of its GDP for 2026, allocating $949.5 billion Taiwan dollars ($31.18 billion). President Donald Trump has demanded Taiwan raise its defense spending to as much as 10% of GDP, a proportion well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend.",
      "The U.S. State Department on Wednesday said it welcomes Taiwan's budget announcement and \"supports Taiwan's acquisition of critical defense capabilities, commensurate with the threat it faces.\"",
      "It also said it welcomes commitments by Lai's administration to increase defense spending to at least 5% of GDP by 2030, \"which demonstrates resolve to strengthen Taiwan's self-defense capabilities.\"",

      "Wellington Koo, Taiwan's defense minister, said Wednesday the $40 billion is an upper limit for the special budget and that it will be used to buy precision-strike missiles and work toward the joint development and procurement between Taiwan and the U.S. of equipment and systems.",
      "Lai also said his government would focus on finding ways to increase its defense against Beijing's \"psychological warfare\" as China attempts to \"weaken our unity.\" He said the government will monitor and increase public awareness of China's interference attempts during major events and elections.",

      "Fire Services Department Director Andy Yeung said a firefighter is among the dead. In a press release, Yeung said the 37-year-old had been a firefighter for nine years. \"All of our colleagues are deeply saddened by the loss of such a devoted comrade,\" he added.",
      "Nine people were declared dead at the scene and four others who were sent to the hospital were later confirmed dead, authorities told reporters. At least 15 more people were injured, and about 700 have been evacuated to temporary shelters.",
      "The raging fire sent up a column of flames and thick smoke as it spread on bamboo scaffolding that had been set up around the exterior of the complex in the city's Tai Po district. Live video from the scene showed firefighters aiming water at the intense flames from high up on ladder trucks as the dusk skies darkened, with smoke billowing from windows and red-hot embers falling to the ground.",
      "It was not immediately known what caused the fire. Officials said the fire started at the external scaffolding of one of the buildings and later spread to inside the building and also to nearby blocks, likely aided by windy conditions.",
      "The blaze was first reported in the mid-afternoon and has since been upgraded to a level 5 alarm, the highest level of severity, the Fire Services Department said.",
      "Police have said they have received multiple reports of people trapped in the affected buildings. Records show the housing complex consisted of eight blocks with almost 2,000 apartments housing about 4,800 people.",

    "summary": "Russian officials say they have now received the revised U.S.-backed proposal to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine, after high-level talks between American and Ukrainian negotiators in Geneva.",
    "story": [
      "A Kremlin spokesperson has watered down expectations that a peace deal is close to being struck to end the nearly four-year-long invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said it's \"premature\" to say whether the situation in Ukraine was close to a resolution.",
      "Peskov also claimed there are people in other countries, including the United States, \"who will try to derail these peaceful developments,\" when asked about leaks from the negotiations.",
      "The comments come after a Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, had struck a more positive tone regarding the state of the U.S.-backed proposal. Ushakov told a Russian state TV reporter on Wednesday that \"some aspects can be viewed positively, but many require special discussions among experts.\"",
      "Ushakov also confirmed that Russia had been presented with the revised proposal that resulted from high-level talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials over the weekend, but said Russian officials had not yet met with their American counterparts to discuss it.",
      "\"We have not discussed it with anyone yet because it really requires serious analysis, serious discussion,\" Ushakov added.",
      "Bloomberg on Tuesday published a translated transcript of a call between Ushakov and Kirill Dmitriev, an economic adviser to the Russian president, that indicated Ushakov thought the Russians would get the \"maximum\" of their demands.",
      "\"No, look. I think we'll just make this paper from our position, and I'll informally pass it along, making it clear that it's all informal,\" Dmitriev said. \"And let them do like their own. But, I don't think they'll take exactly our version, but at least it'll be as close to it as possible.\"",
      "President Trump told reporters on Air Force One Tuesday that U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow next week to discuss the proposal.",
      "Bloomberg on Tuesday night published another transcript of an Oct. 14 phone call between Witkoff and Ushakov in which Witkoff appeared to coach Ushakov on how to negotiate with Mr. Trump, and that Russians expected the proposal between Witkoff and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner to be friendly to them.",
      "\"Now, me to you, I know what it's going to take to get a peace deal done: Donetsk and maybe a land swap somewhere,\" Witkoff said, according to the transcript. \"But I'm saying instead of talking like that, let's talk more hopefully because I think we're going to get to a deal here. And I think Yuri, the president will give me a lot of space and discretion to get to the deal.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump was asked Tuesday about the recording, he said he hadn't heard it, but added that Witkoff was being a \"dealmaker.\"",
      "\"No, but it's a standard thing, you know, because he's got to sell this to Ukraine,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's got to sell Ukraine to Russia. That's what he's that's what a dealmaker does. You got to say, look, they want this. You got to convince him of this. You know, that's a very standard form of negotiation. I haven't heard it, but I heard it was standard negotiation. And I would imagine he's saying the same thing to Ukraine, because each party has to give and take.\"",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that Ukraine's government had \"agreed to a peace deal\" brokered by the Trump administration to stop Russia's assault. The American official and Ukraine's national security adviser, Rustem Umerov, said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "The response from Russia appears to contradict the optimism expressed by Mr. Trump when he took to his Truth Social platform on Tuesday evening to highlight what he called \"tremendous progress\" in the negotiations.",
      "\"The original 28-Point Peace Plan, which was drafted by the United States, has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides, and there are only a few remaining points of disagreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He added that he is sending Witkoff to Moscow to meet with Putin in hopes of \"finalizing\" the the peace plan.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday night that negoitators had \"taken each one of the 28 points, and then you get down to 22 points. A lot of them were solved, and actually very favorably solved.\" He continued that Russia will make concessions, but added \"their big concession is they stop fighting and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Last week,\u00a0CBS News obtained\u00a0a draft of one Trump administration-backed proposal to end the war. The proposed plan included several provisions that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected in the past, such as a requirement that Ukraine give up its entire Donetsk region \u2014 including parts that aren't occupied by Russia \u00a0\u2014 and that Ukraine end its push to join NATO.",

    "story": [
      "A woman in New Zealand who was convicted of\u00a0murdering her two children and leaving their bodies in suitcases for years before they were discovered will spend at least 17 years in prison, a judge ruled Wednesday.",
      "Justice Geoffrey Venning told Hakyung Lee at the High Court hearing in the city of Auckland that she would begin her sentence as a patient in a locked psychiatric facility, under New Zealand's compulsory mental health treatment law. Lee must return to prison when she is well enough, the judge said.",
      "\"You could not cope when [your husband] became seriously unwell, and perhaps you could not bear to have the children around you as a constant reminder of your former happy life, which had been cruelly taken from you,\" the judge said, according to BBC News.",
      "A jury in September found Lee guilty of the murders of Minu Jo, 6, and Yuna Jo, 8, rejecting a defense of insanity. Her lawyers on Wednesday argued for a reduced sentence because of her mental illness, saying their client felt shame for her crimes and had been isolated and threatened in jail.",
      "However, the judge told Lee that while she was undoubtedly experiencing severe depression when she killed the children in 2018, her actions were deliberate and calculated, the news outlet Stuff reported. In New Zealand, a successful insanity defense requires a murder defendant to prove they were incapable of understanding what they were doing or that it was wrong.",
      "The children's remains were discovered after Lee stopped paying rental fees for an Auckland storage unit when she ran into financial difficulties in 2022. The locker's contents were auctioned online and the buyers found the bodies inside.",
      "Lee fled to South Korea after the killings, where she changed her name, before being extradited to face trial. She is a New Zealand citizen who was born in South Korea and went by the name Ji Eun Lee previously.",
      "During the trial, Lee's lawyers conceded that Lee had killed the children by giving them an antidepressant medication, but attorney Lorraine Smith said the deaths happened after her client \"descended into madness,\" local news outlets reported. Lee had always been \"fragile,\" said Smith, but her mental illness became worse after her husband's death.",
      "\"If she wanted to die, why didn't she die alone? Why did she take the innocent children with her?\" Lee's mother wrote in a statement, BBC News reported, citing New Zealand media reports.",
      "During the trial, a palliative care counselor said in a statement read to the court that Lee had said she \"wanted it all to be over\" and often mentioned ending both her and her husband's life, the\u00a0Australian national broadcaster ABC reported.",
      "Those convicted of murder in New Zealand automatically receive a life sentence, with judges setting a minimum period of at least 10 years before the defendant can apply for parole. Lee must serve at least 17 years, Justice Venning ruled.",
      "The children's uncle, Jimmy Sei Wook Jo, was in court, where a lawyer read a statement on his behalf.",
      "\"I never imagined such a profound tragedy would ever befall our family,\" the statement said, according to local news outlets. \"I feel like I failed to look after my niece and nephew.\"",
      "A prosecutor read out a statement by Lee's mother, Choon Ja Lee, who spoke of her devastation at learning what had happened to the children.",
      "\"It felt like a pain that cut through my bones, or as if someone was gouging out my chest,\" her statement said, according to local news reports. \"I do not know when this pain and suffering might heal, but I often think I may carry it with me until the day I die.\"",
      "After Wednesday's hearing, New Zealand's police acknowledged authorities in South Korea for their help with the investigation.",
      "\"Yuna and Minu would have been 16 and 13 today,\" Det. Inspector Tofilau Faamanuia Va'aelua said in a statement. \"Our thoughts are with the wider family today for the tragic loss of these two young children.\"",

      "\"I will be briefed on all progress made, along with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages.\"",
      "Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that \"we're making progress.\" Asked what points of disagreement remain, he said, \"standard things,\" but \"people are starting to realize it's a good deal for both parties.\"",
      "On Tuesday morning, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u00a0wrote on X, \"Over the past week, the United States has made tremendous progress towards a peace deal by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the table. There are a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Russia, the invading force, to what was agreed to in Abu Dhabi, and there were no details from U.S. or Ukrainian officials about what is in the latest proposal. Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which include U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all together at the same time.",
      "Speaking earlier on Tuesday, veteran Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that while Russia \"appreciates the U.S.' position, which is taking the initiative in resolving the Ukrainian conflict,\" Moscow \"operates professionally, not leaking information before formal agreements are reached ... Russia expects the U.S. to inform it of the results of consultations with Ukraine and Europe in the near future.\"",
      "Lavrov stressed that, while Russia was still waiting to receive \"from our American colleagues\" an updated version of the peace proposal, Moscow expected it to include basic tenets agreed between Presidents Trump and Putin during their August meeting in Alaska.",
      "\"Key proposals of Trump's plan are based on understandings reached in Anchorage,\" Lavrov said. He said those principles were \"reflected in the plan\" proposed last week by the White House, \"which we welcomed \u2014 President Putin said that.\"",
      "\"We are ready to discuss concrete formulations because there are a whole row of questions that need to be clarified,\" Lavrov said, adding: \"If there will be no spirit and letter of Anchorage on the key understandings that we have fixated, then it will be a different situation in principle.\"",
      "Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which involve U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all meeting together at the same time.",
      "Umerov also\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the country's negotiators had \"reached a common understanding on the core terms\" of an agreement discussed among U.S., European and Ukrainian officials in Geneva over the weekend.",
      "\"We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps. We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine's President to the U.S. at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump,\" Umerov said.",
      "A Trump administration official said there was no agreement for Zelenskyy to come to the U.S. as of late Tuesday morning, but that if a meeting does happen in the coming days, it could take place at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "A U.S. military official in Abu Dhabi told CBS News Driscoll spent hours negotiating Tuesday with Russian representatives, going in and out of meetings all day.",
      "\"We remain very optimistic,\" the official said. \"Secretary Driscoll is optimistic. Hopefully, we'll get feedback from the Russians soon. This is moving quick.\"",
      "It is not clear who else is in the U.S. delegation in Abu Dhabi. A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation was also there and has been in contact with Driscoll and his team.",
      "The apparent progress in Abu Dhabi comes amid an intensified push by President Trump to secure a ceasefire in the almost four-year-long Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "A source with knowledge told CBS News that Driscoll was working in Abu Dhabi off of a revised version of the White House's 28-point proposal, following productive negotiations in Geneva.",
      "Over the weekend, Driscoll, Rubio, Witkoff, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomats from Ukraine and European allies attended talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Driscoll's meeting with Russian officials also follows a visit to Ukraine's capital last week.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, CBS News reported on Sunday.",
      "Last week, CBS News obtained a draft of one Trump administration-backed proposal to end the war. The proposed plan included several provisions that Zelenskyy has rejected in the past, such as a requirement that Ukraine give up its entire Donetsk region \u2014 including parts that aren't occupied by Russia \u2014 and an end to the country's push to join NATO.",
      "There is also an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday the document specifies that the U.S. intends to offer \"security assurances\" that she said are along the lines of Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which\u00a0commits members to come to the defense of a NATO state that is attacked.",
      "On Saturday, a group of NATO members and other U.S. allies released a joint statement calling the proposed peace plan \"a basis which will require additional work.\"",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following the discussions in Geneva. Rubio described one session in Geneva as \"very meaningful\" but added that \"there's still some work left to do, and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed Zelenskyy to reach a deal by Thanksgiving, though Rubio described that deadline as flexible on Sunday.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to believe that he will take the Donetsk region of Ukraine one way or the other \u2014 either through a negotiated settlement or on the battlefield. The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct.",
      "While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk. The official indicated that the Russian progress in the eastern frontline city of Pokrovsk, which is a logistics hub for Ukraine, was not a positive sign for Kyiv's defensive prospects. Russian media often refers to Pokrovsk as the \"gateway\" to Ukraine's industrial Donbas region.",

      "Two mountain climbers have died on Aoraki, New Zealand's tallest peak, and two others from the same group were rescued, authorities said.",
      "One of the two people killed in a fall was from the United States, officials said Wednesday. Specialists from rescue organizations and government agencies recovered the dead climbers' bodies late Tuesday local time, according to Police Area Commander Inspector Vicki Walker.",
      "Authorities were working with the U.S. consulate, she said. A coroner in New Zealand will investigate the deaths.",
      "The other person who died was an internationally recognized climbing guide and a member of the New Zealand Mountain Guides Association, the organization said in a statement.",
      "Sgt. Kevin McErlain told The Timaru Herald the pair had been connected by a rope when they fell near the summit of Aoraki, also known as Mount Cook.",
      "Authorities learned late Monday night local time that four climbers needed help on the mountain, which is on New Zealand's South Island. Two of the climbers were rescued by helicopter in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Walker said.",
      "They were uninjured. Searchers in two helicopters looked throughout the night for the other climbers, who were found dead hours later.",
      "Aoraki is 12,218 feet high and is part of the Southern Alps, the scenic and icy mountain range that runs the length of the South Island. A settlement of the same name at its base is a destination for domestic and foreign tourists.",
      "The peak is popular among experienced climbers. Its terrain is technically difficult due to crevasses, avalanche risk, changeable weather and glacier movement.",
      "More than 240 deaths have been recorded on the mountain and in the surrounding national park since the start of the 20th century. Dozens of those who died on the mountain have never been found.",
      "This includes three men, two from the U.S. and one from Canada, who were believed to have died on Aoraki in December 2024. The Americans \u2014 Kurt Blair, 56, from Colorado and Carlos Romero, 50, of California \u2014 were certified alpine guides.",
      "The climbers were missing for five days before New Zealand authorities halted a search for them, saying discoveries of their belongings suggested the men had fallen to their deaths.",
      "The two climbers' deaths in New Zealand follow a series of other deaths on some of the world's tallest and most famous peaks in recent months.",

      "Pascal Perrin, an art historian and Renoir expert, lauded the \"exceptional condition of the work, which has undergone no restoration,\" while presenting the canvas.",
      "\"We were particularly surprised by how fresh the painting was,\" Perrin told PBS earlier this month. \"In other words, it is a painting that has retained all of its colors perfectly, which has not been recanvassed, retouched or revarnished.\"",
      "Jean Renoir, born in 1894, went on to receive a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award in 1975, several years before he died at the age of 84. His works include the 1930s classic \"La Grande Illusion,\" which follows two French prisoners of war trying to escape German captivity during World War I.",
      "The painting of him as a child had been valued at 1-1.5 million euros and was acquired by an \"international buyer,\" Drouot said on Tuesday.",
      "\"It is exceptional because, first of all, it is a masterclass of intimacy,\" auctioneer Christophe Joron-Derem told PBS. \"We see this very tender relationship between Jean and Gabrielle, who knows how to control the child so that Renoir can paint him.\"",

      "Her statement didn't say what role they're suspected of having played in the Oct. 19 theft. Police can hold them for questioning for 96 hours.",
      "The loot, valued at around $102 million, hasn't been recovered. It includes a diamond-and-emerald necklace Napoleon gave to Empress Marie-Louise, jewels tied to 19th-century Queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense, and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's pearl-and-diamond tiara.",
      "The thieves dropped a diamond-and-emerald-studded crown that once belonged to Eug\u00e9nie, the wife of Napoleon III, as they escaped.",
      "A police dragnet has previously caught other suspected members of the four-person team thought to have carried out the daring robbery. Investigating magistrates have filed preliminary charges against three men and one woman who were arrested last month.",
      "The heist unfolded when the Louvre, the world's most-visited art museum, was raided in broad daylight. The gang took just seven minutes to steal the jewels before fleeing on scooters.",
      "The thieves parked a moving truck with a ladder below the museum's Apollo Gallery housing the jewels, ascended in a bucket, broke a window and used angle grinders to cut into glass display booths containing the treasures.",
      "One of the men already charged in the heist, a 37-year-old, was in a relationship with the woman and they have children, Beccuau said earlier this month. The couple were arrested after their DNA was found in the basket lift used during the robbery. The man's criminal record contained 11 previous convictions, most of them for theft, she said.",
      "The first two men arrested earlier were also known to the police for having committed thefts. Both lived in the northeastern Paris suburb of Aubervilliers.",
      "Last week, Louvre director Laurence des Cars revealed some new details about the security breach, saying the power tools used by robbers to cut through the display cases were meant for concrete.",
      "\"It's a method that had not been imagined at all\" when the display cases in the Apollo Gallery were replaced in 2019, she said Wednesday while telling lawmakers that new surveillance cameras and anti-intrusion systems will soon be installed at the Paris landmark. At the time, they had been designed primarily to counter an attack from inside the museum with weapons, she added.",
      "Footage from museum cameras show that during the robbery, the display cases \"held up remarkably well and did not break apart,\" she said. \"Videos show how difficult it was for the thieves.\"",
      "Des Cars stressed security improvement is a priority of the decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan launched earlier this year, with an estimated cost of up to 800 million euros ($933 million), to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "With the Louvre crumbling under the weight of mass tourism, des Cars has restricted the daily number of visitors to 30,000 in recent years.",
      "The famed glass pyramid inaugurated in 1989 was meant to welcome about 4 million visitors a year, she recalled. This year, already more than 8 million people have visited the Louvre.",

    "story": [
      "An Australian senator who has long campaigned for the Islamic women's garment known as the burqa to be banned in the country has been suspended from parliament for a week for her protest on Monday in which she wore the full body covering into the chamber and refused to remove it.",
      "Pauline Hanson of the anti-immigration One Nation party was accused of racism by fellow lawmakers when she walked into the parliament wearing a burqa on Monday. Hanson called the move \u2014   which she has now done twice in a decade \u2014 a protest against her colleagues' refusal to allow her to introduce a bill that would ban burqas and other face coverings in public.",
      "Once inside, Hanson refused to remove the burqa, leading the Senate to be suspended for the remainder of that day.",
      "The protest was met by outrage by some of her fellow senators, with Australian Greens leader Larissa Waters calling it a \"middle finger to people of faith.\"",
      "\"It is extremely racist and unsafe,\" Waters added.",
      "On Tuesday, the Senate voted 55 to five on a motion that condemned Hanson's actions as being \"intended to vilify and mock people on the basis of their religion\" and calling them \"disrespectful to Muslim Australians.\"",
      "Following the motion, Hanson was barred for seven consecutive Senate sitting days, which will mean her suspension will continue when parliament comes back into session in February of next year after its holiday break.",
      "Speaking to Sky News Australia, Hanson rejected accusations that her protest had vilified or mocked Muslims.",
      "\"At the end of the day this is Australia. It is not the Australian cultural way of life. I just want equality for all Australians and I don't want to see the suppression or oppression of women in this country,\" she told the news channel.",
      "Hanson previously wore a burqa to Parliament in 2017, but this week was the first time she was punished for it. When she did it in 2017, she said it was to highlight what she called security issues posed by the garment, which she linked to terrorism.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiger-global-trafficking-crisis-decimates-big-cat-populations-report/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 12:01:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The global wild tiger population, once around 100,000, has now plummeted to an estimated 3,700-5,500, a wildlife trade monitoring network said.",
    "story": [
      "Authorities worldwide have seized an average of nine tigers each month over the past five years, highlighting a worsening trafficking crisis that threatens the survival of one of the planet's most iconic species, according to research released Tuesday.",
      "A new report by wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC warned that criminal networks are evolving faster than conservation efforts can respond. The global wild tiger population, once around 100,000 a century ago, has now plummeted to an estimated 3,700-5,500, it said.",
      "Despite half a century of international protection, TRAFFIC's findings showed that tiger trafficking is accelerating and increasingly targeting whole animals, living or dead. Experts say the shift appears linked to captive-breeding operations, but may also reflect tigers being seized shortly after poaching or before being dismembered for their parts. Additionally, it could be driven by a rise in exotic pet ownership or demand for taxidermy, they say.",
      "The report, the sixth in TRAFFIC's Skin and Bones series examining the illegal trade in tigers, highlights stark trends. Between 2000 and mid-2025, law enforcement agencies globally recorded 2,551 seizures involving at least 3,808 tigers.",
      "In the five years from 2020 to June 2025 alone, authorities made 765 seizures, confiscating the equivalent of 573 tigers, roughly nine a month over 66 months. The worst single year was 2019, when 141 seizures were recorded, followed by 139 in 2023.",
      "Most of the seizures occurred within the 13 countries that have wild tiger populations, led by India with the world's biggest tiger population, China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Among countries without tigers, a sizable number of incidents were reported by Mexico, the U.S. and the United Kingdom, the report said. While enforcement has strengthened, so has trade.",
      "\"This rise reflects improved enforcement efforts but also signals persistent and, in some areas, escalating criminal activity and a widespread demand for tigers and their parts,\" said Ramacandra Wong, senior wildlife crime analyst and co-author of the report.",
      "TRAFFIC's latest analysis reveals a dramatic shift: In the 2000s, tiger parts accounted for 90% of seized products but since 2020 that proportion has dropped to 60%, replaced by a spike in seizures of whole animal carcasses and live tigers. More than 40% of confiscations in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia now involve whole tigers.",
      "The report identified entrenched hotspots where interventions should be prioritized: India and Bangladesh's tiger reserves; Indonesia's Aceh region; along the Vietnam\u2013Laos border; and Vietnam's major consumption hubs, including its capital Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report also documents growing \"species convergence\" with almost one in five tiger trafficking incidents involving other threatened wildlife \u2014 most commonly leopards, bears and pangolins.",
      "Patterns of consumption vary sharply by geography. In Mexico and the United States, demand trends toward live tigers, often for exotic pet ownership. Europe shows a stronger market for tiger derivatives used in certain traditional medicines and taxidermy for decoration. Earlier this year, Spanish police arrested two people suspected of selling online exotic cats including protected species such as white tigers and pumas.",
      "Across Asia, demand spans skins, bones, claws and whole dead animals for fashion and traditional medicine.",
      "According to WWF, tiger bones are \"used in traditional medicines or boiled down to make tiger bone glue or steeped in wine, their skins are used as rugs or clothing, their teeth and claws are made into trinkets and amulets, their meat consumed, even their whiskers are highly prized in illegal markets.\"",
      "The report said investigations should not end at the point of seizure. It said strong international cooperation is crucial, and that disruption of organized crime network along the illegal trade chain through intelligence-led, multi-agency enforcement is essential.",
      "Leigh Henry, director of wildlife conservation at the environmental charity WWF, told The Associated Press that the surge in whole-animal trafficking underscored the \"prominent role of captive tiger breeding facilities in feeding and perpetuating the illegal trade.\"",
      "\"Illegal trade remains the greatest immediate threat to wild tigers. If we don't urgently scale up investments to combat tiger trafficking \u2014 at all points along the trade chain \u2014 we absolutely face the possibility of a world without wild tigers,\" she said.",
      "According to WWF, poachers often set up snares in tiger habitats, but \"anything could get caught including tigers, their prey or other wildlife. One thing is for sure whatever is trapped, unless rescued, will die a painful and often slow death.\"",
      "Heather Sohl of the WWF Global Tiger Program called Tuesday's report \"a wake-up call.\"",
      "\"The surge in tiger trafficking and the alarming rise in whole-animal seizures show that criminal networks are adapting faster than our collective response,\" Sohl said in a statement. \"We must urgently scale up investment in tackling illegal trade of tigers from both captive and wild sources across the tiger range countries. Without this, decades of conservation gains risk being undone.\"",

      "Adam woke up at the hospital six days later and learned that he had been diagnosed with a heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, which prevents the heart from pumping blood around the body effectively.",

      "Jige Mughalgai, Afghanistan \u2014\u00a0Afghanistan's Taliban government vowed Tuesday to \"respond appropriately\" to overnight border strikes it blamed on Pakistan that killed 10 people, as tension between the neighbors soared following a suicide bombing in Peshawar a day earlier.",
      "\"The Pakistani invading forces bombed the house of a local civilian resident,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a social media post. \"As a result, nine children (five boys and four girls) and one woman were martyred\" in Khost province.",
      "Mujahid said Pakistani airstrikes targeting the border regions of Kunar and Paktika wounded another four civilians.",
      "The raids were carried out by drones and aircraft, according to Mustaghfir Gurbuz, a spokesman for the governor of Khost.",
      "In Jige Mughalgai, near the border with Pakistan, an AFP correspondent saw residents searching through the rubble of a collapsed house and preparing graves for victims.",
      "\"The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns this violation and reiterates that defending its airspace, territory, and people is its legitimate right, and it will respond appropriately at the right time,\" Mujahid said in a separate statement.",
      "The Pakistani military did not comment on the strikes when contacted by AFP, but before the attacks, the country's Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry said in a television interview that the people behind the deadly suicide attack in Peshawar on Monday had come from Afghanistan.",
      "\"These are the same long-range attacks from Afghanistan about which they used to say they will go as far as Islamabad,\" claimed Chaudhry, without offering any specific evidence. \"There are more than 36 terrorist groups in Afghanistan. These terrorists are Indian proxies.\"",
      "The suicide attack targeted the headquarters of Pakistan's paramilitary Federal Constabulary force in Peshawar, killing three officers and wounding 11 others.",
      "No group has claimed responsibility, but Pakistani state broadcaster PTV reported the attackers were Afghan nationals and said President Asif Zardari blamed the \"foreign-backed Fitna al-Khawarij\" \u2014 Islamabad's term for the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP, or the Pakistani Taliban) militants it accuses of operating from Afghan soil.",
      "Another suicide blast outside a court in the Pakistan capital Islamabad this month killed 12 people and was claimed by a faction of the Pakistani Taliban, which shares the same ideology as the Afghan Taliban but insists it operates independently.",
      "Islamabad blamed a militant cell which was \"guided at every step by the ... high command based in Afghanistan\" for the capital attack.",
      "In a message sent to CBS News' Sami Yousafzai on Tuesday, Amir Mohmand, a TTP commander in a Pakistani region right on the Afghan border, said Pakistan's military strikes on Afghanistan were based on a \"misperception.\"",
      "\"Pakistan is bombing Afghanistan because they think it will stop us ( TTP) from our jihadi struggle against the puppet regime in Islamabad,\" he said. \"The [Afghan] Taliban came to power in 2021. We have been running our struggle since 2006, and even before 1994. The Afghan Taliban may have sympathies on the ground level, but we are independent. No one can define the start or stop of our holy struggle.\"",
      "Mohamand claimed a new wave of suicide bombers had recently completed training and were prepared to carry out additional attacks inside Pakistan.",
      "Pakistan has long accused the Taliban, and India, of covertly backing the TTP's violence, and government Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Tuesday showed a video of an alleged confession by one of the purported suspects in the Peshawar attack, claiming \"clear-cut evidence that TTA [Afghan Taliban] and TTP did it together, and the suicide bomber was a resident of Afghanistan.\"",
      "\"Afghanistan is fully involved ... and their soil is also involved. The people being sheltered there are also involved,\" he said on live television, without mentioning the military's strikes in the neighboring country.",
      "The flare-up of cross-border tension is just the latest challenge to a tenuous ceasefire agreement between the neighbors that came into effect in mid-October, and relations between Islamabad and Kabul have been fraught since the Taliban swept back to power in 2021.",
      "Deadly border clashes in early October killed around 70 people on both sides \u2014 violence that the ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey was intended to halt, but several rounds of talks in Doha and Istanbul failed to produce a lasting agreement, and security issues, especially Pakistan's demand that Kabul go after TTP fighters, have proven to be a sticking point.",
      "Islamabad accuses the Taliban of sheltering militants behind a surge in attacks, including the TTP, which has waged a bloody campaign against Pakistan for years. Kabul denies the charge and counters that Pakistan harbors groups hostile to Afghanistan and does not respect its sovereignty.",

      "The report found that 83,000 women and girls were intentionally killed in 2024. Sixty percent of those women were murdered by partners or relatives such as fathers, uncles, mothers and brothers, the report said.",
      "For comparison, 11% of male murder victims were killed by someone close to them, though about 80% of all homicide victims in 2024 were men, according to the report.",
      "The 50,000 figure \u2014 based on data from 117 countries \u2014 breaks down to 137 women per day, or around one woman every 10 minutes, the report said.",
      "\"The home remains a dangerous and sometimes lethal place for too many women and girls around the world,\" said John Brandolino, acting Executive Director of UNODC, in a news release announcing the report.",
      "The total is slightly lower than the figure reported in 2023, thought it does not indicate an actual decrease, according to the report, as it stems largely from differences in data availability from country to country.",

    "summary": "As U.S. and European officials tout progress in Ukraine peace talks, Zelenskyy says a key sticking point is letting Putin keep \"what he has stolen.\"",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that the suggested legal recognition of Russian sovereignty over captured territory in the east of his country remained a \"main problem\" in negotiations as President Trump pushes for a deal to end Moscow's nearly-four-year war on Ukraine.",
      "Ukrainian and American officials met over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss a 28-point proposal floated last week by the White House. They discussed the possibility of Zelenskyy visiting the U.S. this week as part of Mr. Trump's bid to get an agreement by Thanksgiving, CBS News' Margaret Brennan reported, citing multiple U.S. and Ukrainian officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "Mr. Trump has described the Thanksgiving deadline as flexible, and he told reporters Saturday that the plan presented last week was \"not my final\" proposal.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Geneva for the weekend talks, said \"very, very meaningful\" progress was made with the Ukrainian and European delegations, but that \"there's still some work left to do and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",
      "Addressing Sweden's parliament on Monday, Zelenskyy made it clear one of the key points of contention over the U.S. proposal was a call for Ukraine and the global community to formally recognize some portion of the ground Russian forces have occupied by force as no longer Ukrainian.",
      "\"Putin wants legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" Zelenskyy said. \"That's the main problem. You all understand what that means.\"",
      "Finland's President Alexander Stubb said there were still \"major issues which remain to be resolved\" regarding the U.S. peace proposal, though he also welcomed progress made during the high-stakes talks in Geneva.",
      "Rubio struck a more optimistic tone in describing the weekend talks, saying Sunday that the session in Geneval was \"probably the most productive day we have had on this issue\" since President Trump came back into office for his second term in January.",
      "Rubio stressed that there was more work to do and said he didn't want to \"declare victory or finality.\"",
      "The top U.S. diplomat was pressed by reporters but would not offer any insight into which issues were the main sticking points in the peace talks. He called the proposal a \"living, breathing document\" and said he believed the issues that remained unsettled were \"not insurmountable.\"",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following their discussions, but Russia's government said Monday that the revisions had not been shared, and that it would reserve judgement.",
      "Putin said Friday that the U.S. proposal could serve as the basis of a negotiated resolution to what his government has refused to acknowledge as a war, but he warned that if Ukraine turned down the plan, Russian forces would remain on the attack, seizing yet more ground.",
      "\"We are, of course, closely monitoring the media reports that have been pouring in from Geneva over the past few days,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, \"but we have not yet received anything official.\"",
      "\"We read a statement that, following the discussions in Geneva, some amendments had been made to the text which we had seen earlier. We will wait. It seems that the dialogue is continuing,\" he said, adding that there were no plans for a meeting this week between Russian and U.S. officials on the topic, but that Moscow remained open to dialogue.",
      "The 28-point plan, which U.S. officials said last week had Mr. Trump's backing, sparked alarm among America's European allies for being perceived as too favorable to Russia.",
      "Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that her country had not agreed to all of the terms in the draft plan, which was leaked to media outlets last week.",
      "\"This plan is not about justice and the truth of this war and the aggression,\" Stefanishyna said. \"It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday called for the U.S. to weigh labeling some Middle Eastern affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, taking aim at the controversial Islamist movement.",
      "In an executive order, the president directed his administration to consider whether to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan or elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations. He gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 30 days to submit a report, and 45 days after that to take action.",
      "The order claimed the three countries' Muslim Brotherhood affiliates \"engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilization campaigns.\"",
      "It accused the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood's Lebanese chapter of helping launch rockets at Israel after the terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and alleged a leader of the Egyptian chapter \"encouraged violent attacks against U.S. partners\" after the attack.",
      "The White House also said members of the Jordanian chapter have \"long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas,\" itself a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.",
      "If the groups are designated as foreign terrorist organizations, it would become illegal under U.S. law to knowingly provide funding or other material support to them. The designation can also lead to travel bans against members or the freezing of funds held in U.S. banks.",
      "Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood is an influential political movement in much of the Middle East. The leader of a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political party, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president of Egypt in 2012 after the fall of dictator Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi was ousted by the military the following year.",
      "Some Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt and elsewhere have renounced violence. But the group has long been controversial, with critics \u2014 including U.S. allies \u2014 saying some affiliated groups have engaged in violence or espoused extremist views. Egypt's military government formally banned the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and Jordan banned the group earlier this year.",
      "\"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet.",
      "Mr. Trump's order comes about a week after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and banned it from buying land. Abbott made a similar move toward the Council on American-Islamic Relations, drawing a lawsuit from the civil rights group.",
      "The president has used the executive power to designate groups as terrorist organizations broadly.",
      "His administration labeled several Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups earlier this year, and recently applied the designation to Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, as the administration puts more pressure on the Venezuelan government and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Some analysts say it's not a centralized drug cartel in the traditional sense, but is instead a loosely defined network of government officials accused of links to organized crime and drug trafficking.",
      "The administration earlier this year also designated four European groups that it said are affiliated with antifa. Mr. Trump has labeled antifa as a domestic terror organization, though there isn't a formal system for designating U.S.-based terror groups, and antifa usually refers to a loose collection of left-wing activists rather than a single organization with centralized leadership.",
      "Mr. Trump also considered labeling the Muslim Brotherhood as a terror group in his first term.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has designated the Cartel de los Soles a terrorist organization, but some say the Venezuelan entity is \"not a group\" at all.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government's designation of the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization officially took effect Monday as part of President Trump's aggressive campaign to combat drug trafficking into the United States. The U.S. identifies Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the group's leader \u2014 and he says the claims of narcoterrorism are actually part of a bid by Mr. Trump to force him from power.",
      "The terrorist designation, which was announced last week, is designed to put more pressure on Maduro, even as U.S. warships and more than 10,000 American troops step up training exercises in the region. The U.S. military has also launched deadly strikes on boats it alleges were carrying drugs off Venezuela's coast \u2014 many of them allegedly run by the Tren de Aragua gang, which the U.S. accuses of ties to the Maduro regime.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, Maduro's government said it \"absolutely rejects the new and ridiculous fabrication\" designating \"the nonexistent Cartel of the Suns as a terrorist organization, thus repeating an infamous and vile lie to justify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela, under the classic U.S. format of regime change.\"",
      "Ahead of the designation announcement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed the group was \"responsible for terrorist violence \u2026 as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "The Cartel de los Soles was also hit in July with U.S. economic sanctions, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said highlighted \"the illegitimate Maduro regime's facilitation of narco-terrorism through terrorist groups like Cartel de los Soles.\"",
      "What is \u2014 and what isn't \u2014 the Cartel de los Soles?",
      "But what is the so-called Cartel of the Suns? It is not, in the traditional sense, a Latin American drug cartel along the lines of the family-run Sinaloa or the Jalisco New Generation.",
      "The \"suns\" in the name refers to the insignia used for decades to adorn the uniforms of high-ranking Venezuelan military officers.",
      "Venezuelans, including prosecutors and other officials, started using the term colloquially in the 1990s to refer to the cadre of high-ranking military officers who'd grown rich from facilitating drug-running. As corruption expanded across the country, first under the late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and then under Maduro as his successor, analysts say the term came to encompass the loosely defined network of police and government officials that facilitated and profited off of activities ranging from illegal mining to fuel and drug trafficking.",
      "The term was first elevated to define an alleged Maduro-led drug trafficking organization in 2020, when the U.S. Justice Department, during President Trump's first administration, announced indictments of Venezuela's leader and members of his inner circle on narcoterrorism and other charges. The Justice Department accused Maduro, through the Cartel de los Soles, of working directly with the Colombian rebel group FARC to traffic cocaine through Venezuela to the U.S.",
      "The designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization has generally been reserved for groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS, but the Trump administration has expanded its use to designate eight Latin American organizations accused of drug trafficking and people smuggling, calling it an effort to counter narcoterrorism.",
      "Some analysts say it's a stretch to even define the Cartel de los Soles as a single unified organization.",
      "\"It is not a group,\" Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America think tank told The Associated Press. \"It's not like a group that people would ever identify themselves as members. They don't have regular meetings. They don't have a hierarchy.\"",
      "\"It is not a hierarchical or ideological group,\" agrees the InSight Crime outlet, which is run by two former journalists who covered Latin America extensively for decades. \"Its structure consists of a diffuse network of cells embedded within Venezuela's main military branches: the army, the navy, the air force, and the national guard, from the lowest to the highest ranks.\"",
      "\"Although the concept is primarily associated with the military sector, other branches of the [Venezuelan] State embedded within the criminal ecosystem have also been identified, including police forces, the executive branch, and various public officials,\" InSight Crime said in an analysis of the purported cartel published in September.",
      "Terrorist designation comes amid U.S. military strikes and build-up",
      "In recent weeks, the U.S. military has conducted at least 21 strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing dozens of people and sparking a debate in Washington about the legality of the extrajudicial attacks.",
      "The Trump administration has carried out the strikes without providing evidence to support its assertions that the boats are carrying drugs and operated by criminal organizations. It says the attacks, which began in late September off the coast of Venezuela and expanded to the eastern Pacific, are meant to stop narcotics reaching American soil.",
      "But Maduro, and some others, see the U.S. military operations and massive buildup of hardware in the region as an effort to precipitate his ouster \u2014   if not the prelude to an overt operation to topple his government.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has said the formal designation of the Cartel de los Soles will give a \"whole bunch of new options to the United States\" to address Maduro's alleged crimes.",
      "But speaking in an interview with conservative news outlet OAN, he declined to give details on what those options included, or to say whether the U.S. military was planning to carry out strikes on targets inside Venezuela.",
      "\"Nothing is off the table, but nothing's automatically on the table,\" he said.",
      "Since American troops and hardware \u2014   including the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's most advanced aircraft carrier \u2014   started pouring into the Caribbean earlier this year, Venezuela's U.S.-backed political opposition has been more confidently voicing its perennial promise to see Maduro forced from office, fueling speculation over the real endgame of what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation.",
      "Asked by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell during an extensive interview for 60 Minutes just weeks ago whether the U.S. operations around Venezuela were about \"getting rid of Maduro,\" President Trump said they were \"about many things,\" but he said the Venezuelan leader's days in office were likely numbered.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 11:09:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration said it would end Temporary Protected Status for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests.

    "story": [
      "A pocket watch that once belonged to one of the Titanic's most renowned passengers has sold at an auction for $2.3 million \u2014 a record price for memorabilia related to the historic shipwreck, according to the auction house.",
      "The 18-carat gold watch was gifted to its original owner, Isidor Straus, by his wife, Ida Straus, for his 43rd birthday, said Henry Aldridge and Son, the auction house that sold it on Saturday. It was recovered from his body after the Titanic sunk in the North Atlantic in April 1912.",
      "Isidor Straus was an American businessman and politician who owned the Macy's department store in New York City. He and his wife were first-class passengers on the Titanic during its maiden voyage from England to New York, and the couple are remembered for their final act of selflessness while on board.",
      "Witnesses who survived the Titanic wreck said afterward that the Strauses were offered two seats on a lifeboat once the ship had struck an iceberg, according to the U.K. government's\u00a0National Archives. But Isidor Straus refused his seat, instead insisting that it should have been offered to younger men, and Ida Straus followed him, reportedly saying, \"Where you go, I go.\"",
      "According to those archives, Isidor and Ida Straus were last seen standing arm in arm on the deck of the Titanic, before a wave crashed overhead and washed them out to sea. The Strauses were the ancestors of Wendy Rush, wife of OceanGate founder Stockton Rush, who died in the infamous Titan submersible explosion in 2023 en route to the Titanic wreck site.",
      "Straus' pocket watch exceeded the previous record sale for a piece of the Titanic's history memorabilia by about $300,000, according to Henry Aldridge and Son. The previous record was set for another gold pocket watch, which sold an auction last year for about $1.97 million. It had been gifted by Titanic survivors to the captain of the RMS Carpathia, who steered his ship toward the Titanic wreck on the night it sunk and ultimately rescued hundreds of passengers still afloat on life boats, according to the auction house.",
      "\"Pocket watches are incredibly personal items,\" said Andrew Aldridge, managing director of the auction house, in a statement. \"Every man, woman and child passenger or crew had a story to tell and they are told 113 years later through the objects that they owned. Items like this keep the story alive and bring us closer to the memory of one of the biggest tragedies of the 20th century.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 08:51:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Jimmy Cliff, who famously sang about the \"many rivers\" we all must cross, has died after suffering a seizure and pneumonia, his family say.",
    "story": [
      "Reggae music icon Jimmy Cliff, who's unique tone, lyricism and breakthrough role on the silver screen helped make the music of his native Jamaica part of popular culture across the globe, has died at the age of 81, his family said in a statement shared Monday on social media.",
      "\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" Latifa Chambers said in a statement posted on Cliff's Instagram account. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career \u2026 Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\"",
      "The couple's children Lilty and Aken also signed the statement.",
      "Cliff was one of Jamaican music's early international stars, emerging as reggae evolved from the sounds of ska and rocksteady in the 1960s and early 1970s. His starring role in the enduring classic movie \"The Harder They Come,\" an entirely Jamaican production, in 1972 cemented his legacy as not only a musician, but a cultural phenom.",
      "Cliff played Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin,  an aspiring singer who came up against the harsh realities of a music business run by self-interested producers, at the expense of artists, and the abundant traps for young Jamaicans trying to survive amid an epidemic of violent gang crime that swept the nation.",
      "\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety magazine in a 2022 interview to mark the 50th anniversary of the movie's release. \"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. However, being a hero was the manner in which [director] Perry [Henzel] wanted to make his name \u2014 an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"",
      "The messages in the movie, just like his music, were timeless.",
      "The title track from \"The Harder They Come,\" along with familiar hits including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" spoke to the struggles of Jamaicans at the time, but they have continued to resonate with audiences around the world since he wrote them.",
      "Cliff, along with other icons such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert helped give the music and culture of their relatively small Caribbean nation a global impact that endures today, and far exceeds Jamaica's size in terms of population economy.",
      "His animated onstage presence and high-pitched tone were unmistakable. Cliff released his last single, \"Human Touch,\"   only four years ago. According to The Associated Press, Cliff was nominated for Grammy awards seven times and he won twice, taking best reggae album in 1986 with \"Cliff Hanger,\" and again in 2012 with \"Rebirth.\"",
      "In a tribute posted on his own social media accounts early Monday morning, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called Cliff \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world.\"",
      "\"Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul,\" Holness said. \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.  We give thanks for his life, his contribution, and the pride he brought to Jamaica ... Walk good, Jimmy Cliff. Your legacy lives on in every corner of our island and in the hearts of the Jamaican people.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposed-28-point-russia-ukraine-peace-plan/",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 12:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up territory and swear off NATO membership.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Ukraine said on Nov. 25 that it has agreed to \"the core terms\" of a peace deal\u00a0brokered by the U.S., amid ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi to work out remaining details. None of the changes to the Trump administration's original 28-point proposal\u00a0have been released. Read the latest here; our earlier story on the initial proposal is below.",
      "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war\u00a0\u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official.",
      "The 28-point plan is the most recent working document offered by the administration, reflecting feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, the White House official said. It still remains unclear whether both sides will agree to it; diplomatic conversations are ongoing and further changes are being negotiated, according to multiple sources.",
      "While some European governments were aware the U.S. was working on a proposal, they were not involved in drafting it, according to European officials contacted by CBS News.",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "The plan was also presented to a senior member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, Rustem Umerov, a White House official said. Umerov confirmed on\u00a0X\u00a0that he was party to the talks on a technical level but said, \"I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure.\"",
      "On Thursday, Zelenskyy met with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in Kyiv, and was presented with what he later characterized in a post on X as \"points of a plan to end the war \u2014 [America's] vision.\" Zelenskyy said he outlined Ukraine's key principles, and the two sides agreed to continue working on the plan's provisions. A White House official told CBS News that Driscoll had two hours of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including 45 minutes of direct talks with Zelenskyy, which they described as \"productive.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS News: \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after 5 years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"",
      "Here's how the proposed plan would work:",
      "Immediate ceasefire",
      "The plan says a ceasefire would take effect immediately if both sides agree to the deal.",
      "Ukraine expected to give up its eastern regions",
      "As written, the plan would allow Russia to hold onto much of the Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies \u2014 and take over some Ukrainian-held areas.",
      "The plan calls for the Ukrainian oblasts of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to be recognized by the U.S. and others as de facto Russian territory. Crimea was fully annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Russian military has occupied most of Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 collectively known as the Donbas \u2014 since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine were first occupied by Russian-aligned forces in 2014.",
      "Crucially, parts of Donetsk that are still under Ukrainian control would also be ceded to Russia, according to the proposal, but would be deemed a neutral buffer zone with no Russian military presence.",
      "The conflict would be frozen at the existing front lines in two other Ukrainian oblasts \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhia \u2014 effectively allowing Russia to hold onto cities like Mariupol and retain a land connection to Crimea.",
      "Those terms could prove to be a sticking point for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has long refused to give up any new territory or recognize Russian control over Crimea, instead calling for the war to be paused on the existing conflict lines.",
      "Ukraine must cap its military size",
      "The proposal also calls for Ukraine to cap the size of its military at 600,000 people.",
      "Zelensky said in January that the country's military numbered 880,000, according to the Kyiv Independent. Six years earlier, it had roughly 250,000 troops, the Atlantic Council said.",
      "No to NATO membership \u2014 but Ukraine can join the EU",
      "Under the plan, Ukraine would be barred from joining NATO.",
      "The country would be expected to modify its constitution to specify that it will not join the 32-nation bloc, a change of course since the country's NATO aspirations are currently enshrined in its constitution. Ukraine has pursued NATO membership for years, a status that would require the United States and other members to come to the country's defense if it's attacked again.",
      "And NATO is expected to agree not to accept Ukraine into the alliance. In 2008, its member states issued a declaration agreeing that Ukraine would become a member of NATO at some point in the future, but it did not set out a timeline.",
      "The plan also calls for NATO to agree not to send troops to Ukraine \u2014 possibly scuttling any postwar security deal that involves placing allied troops on Ukrainian soil.",
      "Another point in the plan says Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand any further \u2014 a favorable point for Russia, which has long chafed at the alliance's post-Cold War expansions. Sweden and Finland are the alliance's newest members, joining in 2024 and 2023, respectively, partly in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "NATO's longstanding position is that it has an \"open door policy,\" and decisions to admit new countries are made by its members, not any other countries.",
      "But the plan does specify that Ukraine has a right to join the European Union, and that it would get access to the European market in the meantime. Russia has long been wary of further economic and political integration between Ukraine and Europe.",
      "A U.S. guarantee",
      "The plan lays out a security guarantee if Russia reinvades Ukraine, calling for a \"decisive coordinated military response\" and the reinstatement of sanctions on Russia. Other benefits from the agreement, including recognition of new Russian territory, would be called off as well. The plan does not specify what type of military response Russia would face.",
      "The guarantee would be terminated if Ukraine invades Russia, or if it launches missiles at Moscow or St. Petersburg.",
      "Ukrainian elections",
      "Ukraine would be expected to hold elections in 100 days. Ukraine had elections scheduled for early 2024, but they were delayed due to the war. Zelenskyy won the presidency in 2019.",
      "Economic plan for Ukraine, Russian sanctions lifted",
      "The plan calls for a recovery plan for Ukraine, whose economy has been devastated by a yearslong Russian invasion and aerial bombardment. That includes reconstruction of Ukrainian cities, a development fund to boost Ukraine's tech industry and investments in mining and gas.",
      "Some $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be invested in Ukraine, with the U.S. leading that effort. Europe would contribute an additional $100 billion.",
      "The plan also calls for negotiations on lifting the hefty sanctions that Russia has faced since the invasion began, choking it off from much of the global economy. The sanctions would be lifted in stages, according to the framework. And frozen Russian assets beyond $100 billion would be plowed into a joint U.S.-Russia investment fund.",
      "The overall plan would be monitored and enforced by a Peace Council, to be chaired by President Trump.",
      "Other points in the plan include a Russia-NATO security dialogue, a joint U.S.-Russia security working group and a non-aggression pact between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. It would also extend U.S.-Russia arms control treaties, require Ukraine to be a non-nuclear state and bar Russia from blocking Ukraine from using the key Dnipro river for commercial purposes.",
      "All civilian detainees taken during the war would be returned, including children, and both sides in the conflict would be granted amnesty for their conduct during the war. And both countries would be expected to adopt educational programs to discourage racial prejudice.",
      "The plan also calls for a return of Russia to the Group of Eight, a grouping of powerful countries that kicked Russia out after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.",
      "Leavitt said in her statement: \"As the Trump Administration has clearly said, any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe, and Russia to ensure the end of the war, in addition to financial opportunities for Ukraine to rebuild, and for Russia to rejoin the global economy, to benefit the people in both countries.\"",

      "Fox News senior correspondent Jonathan Serrie discusses the increase in colon cancer rates among young adults on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "A new study from Northwestern Medicine suggests that current lung cancer screening guidelines may be missing most Americans who develop the disease \u2014 and researchers say it\u2019s time for a major change.",
      "Published in JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed nearly 1,000 lung cancer patients who were treated at Northwestern Medicine between 2018 and 2023.",
      "The goal was to see how many of those patients would have qualified for screening under existing guidance from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",
      "STEALTH BREAST CANCER THAT HIDES FROM SCANS TARGETED IN BREAKTHROUGH TECH",
      "USPSTF currently recommends annual CT scans for adults ages 50 to 80 who have a 20 pack-year smoking history (the equivalent of one pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years) and either still smoke or quit within the last 15 years.",
      "Only about 35% of those diagnosed with lung cancer met the current criteria to undergo screenings.",
      "Current lung cancer screening guidelines may be missing most people who develop the disease, a new study shows. (iStock)",
      "That means roughly two-thirds of patients would not have been flagged for testing before their diagnosis.",
      "\"Not only does that approach miss many patients who had quit smoking in the past or did not quite meet the high-risk criteria, it also misses other patients at risk of lung cancer, such as non-smokers,\" Luis Herrera, M.D., a thoracic surgeon at Orlando Health, told Fox News Digital.",
      "The study noted that these patients tended to have adenocarcinoma, the most common type of lung cancer among never-smokers.",
      "Missed patients tended to have adenocarcinoma, the most common type of lung cancer among never-smokers. (iStock)",
      "Those missed by the guidelines were more often women, people of Asian descent and individuals who had never smoked, the study found.",
      "The research team also compared survival outcomes. Patients who didn\u2019t meet the screening criteria had better survival, living a median of 9.5 years compared with 4.4 years for those who did qualify.",
      "ERIN ANDREWS HAD 'NO SYMPTOMS' BEFORE CANCER DIAGNOSIS, PUSHES FOR EARLY SCREENINGS",
      "While this difference partly reflects tumor biology and earlier detection, it also highlights how current screening rules fail to catch a broad range of cases that could be treated sooner, according to researchers.",
      "\"The current participation in lung cancer screening for patients who do qualify based on smoking history is quite low,\" said Herrera, who was not involved in the study. This is likely due to the complexity of the risk-based criteria and stigma associated with smoking and lung cancer, he added.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "To test an alternative, the researchers modeled a different approach: screening everyone between the ages of 40 and 85, regardless of smoking history.",
      "Under that universal, age-based model, about 94% of the cancers in their cohort would have been detected.",
      "Universal screening procedures could save lives and hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to the researchers. (iStock)",
      "Such a change could prevent roughly 26,000 U.S. deaths each year, at a cost of about $101,000 per life saved, according to their estimates.",
      "The study emphasized that this would be far more cost-effective than current screening programs for breast or colorectal cancer, which cost between $890,000 and $920,000 per life saved.",

      "Herrera noted the many challenges in the adoption of lung cancer screening, from lack of awareness to some providers not recommending the screening test.",
      "However, he added, \"The cost of screening is covered by most health insurance plans and many institutions also offer discounts for patients who don\u2019t have insurance.\"",
      "\"The current participation in lung cancer screening for patients who do qualify based on smoking history is quite low.\"",
      "Lung cancer remains the deadliest cancer in the country, killing more people each year than colon, prostate and breast cancer combined. But because of the narrow eligibility criteria based on smoking history, millions at risk never get screened.",
      "Northwestern Medicine researchers argue that expanding screening to include all adults within an age range could help close those gaps, especially for groups often underdiagnosed.",
      "Researchers argue that expanding screening to include all adults could help catch the missing cases. (iStock)",
      "The study was conducted at a single academic center, which means the patient population may not represent the wider U.S. population. It also looked back at existing data, so it can\u2019t prove how the new model would perform in real-world screening programs, the researchers acknowledged.",

      "The cost and mortality projections rely on assumptions that could shift depending on how screening is implemented.",

      "Researchers at King\u2019s College London experimented with keratin, the same natural protein found in hair, skin and nails, on teeth. In lab tests, the system \"has shown potential in repairing early defective dental enamel lesions, restoring both optical appearance and mechanical properties,\" potentially offering a future in reversing cavities.",
      "Daily habits like sipping acidic drinks or skipping proper brushing gradually erode enamel, causing sensitivity and tooth loss, the study explains. While fluoride can only slow the damage, the keratin-based formula in the new study stopped it entirely in lab tests.",

      "The AI tags pull from reservation and POS data to highlight patterns like drink choices, spending ranges and dining habits across visits. (Jeffrey Greenberg/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "How OpenTable gathers this information",
      "OpenTable integrates with POS (Point of Sale) platforms such as Toast or Epos. These systems handle orders, payments and timing during a meal. When your contact details match your OpenTable account, the platform can connect your visit to your profile.",
      "This can include arrival time, general order details, time spent and bill totals. Reporting shows that these items help OpenTable generate AI summaries of non-identifiable guest data when the restaurant uses a supported POS system and has enabled data sharing. You do not need to book through OpenTable for this to happen. You only need an account and matching contact information.",
      "Some users who pulled their data through OpenTable's privacy request form saw very limited information. Basic contact details and a list of past reservations were the main items. That suggests the insight level depends on which restaurants use POS integrations and how long they have used them.",
      "Why restaurants want these insights",
      "Restaurants have tracked guest preferences for years. Staff may note favorite dishes or preferred seating. They may watch for frequent lateness or recurring celebrations. This helps them shape a smooth visit.",
      "OpenTable's AI-summarized guest insights aim to offer a simplified version of these notes. They highlight drink categories, spending ranges or behavior patterns. However, Menter notes the tags can be off base. A single business dinner can mark someone as a high spender. Eating with friends who order cocktails can make a person look like a cocktail lover. Because of this, Menter treats the tags as loose suggestions rather than reliable signals.",
      "THAT'S NOT A HUMAN TALKING TO YOU IN THE FAST FOOD DRIVE-THRU",
      "How the AI works",
      "OpenTable says the AI does not process personal guest data. Instead, it is employed for high-level classification and categorization of large, anonymized data sets. For instance, the AI analyzes various point-of-sale descriptions (like \"glass of cabernet\") to consistently categorize them as \"red wine,\" \"white wine,\" etc., without ever interacting with specific guest profiles.",
      "The platform says these insights can help staff suggest dishes or set a relaxed pace. OpenTable also says the use of POS information depends on the privacy settings you choose, and you can review, adjust or opt out of data sharing at any time. Still, the privacy policy uses broad terms like dining preferences.",
      "A TikTok video from a Michelin-starred restaurant host first revealed the AI-assisted diner tags now being tested in OpenTable\u2019s Pro tools. (iStock)",
      "\"Guest insights are the engine of personalization, allowing restaurants to optimize their service and deliver the kind of thoughtful hospitality that both benefits the business and offers a special experience for the diner,\" an OpenTable representative told CyberGuy. \"These insights come from a mix of sources \u2014 including OpenTable, our restaurant partners, and POS partners \u2014 and are limited to non-confidential information.\"",
      "\"They might help a server suggest a dish you\u2019ll love or recognize that you prefer a more relaxed dining pace,\" the representative said. \"We also share these insights across our network so restaurants can learn and improve the hospitality experience for everyone, not just individual guests. You\u2019re in charge of what data you share. Through your OpenTable preferences and settings, you can review, adjust, or opt out of data sharing at any time. What we share with restaurants is guided by the choices you\u2019ve made in your privacy preferences.\"",
      "What data gets shared and how to limit it",
      "If a diner is opted in, OpenTable shares your name, contact details, party size and special requests with the restaurant you book. The company also confirms that participating restaurants share POS data with OpenTable. This can include items ordered, bill totals and how long you stayed. OpenTable then turns this into aggregated insights.",

      "Google officially shut down remote control features for first and second generation Nest Learning Thermostats last month. Many owners assumed the devices would stop talking to Google once the company removed smart functions.",

      "Researcher finds unexpected data uploads from old Nest devices",
      "Security researcher Cody Kociemba uncovered this quiet data flow after digging into the backend as part of a repair bounty challenge run by FULU, a right-to-repair group cofounded by electronics repair expert and YouTuber Louis Rossmann. The challenge asked developers to restore lost smart features for unsupported Nest devices. Kociemba teamed up with the open-source community and created No Longer Evil, software that brings smart functionality back to these aging thermostats.",

      "Researcher Cody Kociemba uncovered the ongoing data uploads while building a tool to restore smart functions. (Google)",
      "What Nest thermostats keep sending to Google",
      "Even though remote control no longer works, Kociemba found that early Nest Learning Thermostats still upload a steady stream of sensor data to Google. This includes:",
      "Manual temperature changesWhether someone is in the roomWhen sunlight hits the deviceTemperature readingsHumidity levelsMotion activityAmbient light data",

      "When sunlight hits the device",
      "Temperature readings",
      "Humidity levels",
      "Motion activity",
      "Ambient light data",
      "Kociemba says the volume of logs was extensive. He turned off the incoming data because he never expected the devices to remain connected to Google after the shutdown.",
      "Google previously said unsupported models will \"continue to report logs for issue diagnostics.\" However, Kociemba points out that Google cannot use that data to help customers anymore because support is fully discontinued. That makes the continued data flow even more puzzling.",
      "AI FLAW LEAKED GMAIL DATA BEFORE OPENAI PATCH",
      "CyberGuy contacted Google for comment, and a spokesperson provided us with the statement,",
      "\"The Nest Learning Thermostat (1st and 2nd Gen) is no longer supported in the Nest and Home apps, but temperature and scheduling adjustments can still be made directly on the unit. These devices will soon be unpaired and removed from all user accounts. Diagnostic logs, which are not tied to a specific user account, will continue to be sent to Google for service and issue tracking. Users who prefer to stop providing these logs can simply disconnect their device from Wi-Fi via the on-device settings menu.\"",
      "The thermostats continue reporting temperature, motion and light data even though official support has ended.",
      "Why this discovery matters",
      "Google cut access to remote control, security updates, software updates and status checks through the Nest and Google Home apps. Owners can no longer rely on the devices for key smart features. Yet the thermostats still push data to Google, creating a one-way connection that helps the company more than the customer.",
      "Users do not benefit from the logs because support has been discontinued. Google cannot use these logs to diagnose problems or offer help. That raises questions about transparency and user choice for people who assumed the connection ended.",
      "The FULU bounty that sparked the discovery",
      "FULU's bounty program encouraged developers to build tools that restore functionality to devices abandoned by their makers. After reviewing submissions, FULU awarded Kociemba and another developer known as Team Dinosaur the top bounty of $14,772 for bringing smart features back to early Nest models.",
      "Their work highlights how community-driven repair efforts can keep useful devices alive. It also reveals how companies handle device data long after official support stops.",
      "Ways to stay safe if you still use an old Nest thermostat",
      "If you keep one of these unsupported Nest thermostats on your network, you can take a few simple steps to protect your privacy. These tips help reduce what the device sends to Google and lower your exposure.",
      "Start by checking what Google has linked to your home devices. Visit myactivity.google.com and look for thermostat logs or events you do not expect.",
      "A guest network keeps the thermostat away from your main devices. This limits what the thermostat can reach and helps prevent broader access.",
      "Some routers let you stop individual devices from sending data to the internet. This cuts off log uploads while still letting the thermostat control heating and cooling.",
      "If the device menu still offers cloud settings, turn off anything related to remote access or online diagnostics. Even partial controls help reduce data flow.",
      "Check your connected devices in your Google settings. Remove any old Nest entries that no longer serve a purpose. This stops leftover links that may still send data.",
      "Some routers send analytics back to the router maker. Turn off cloud diagnostics to reduce the footprint of unsupported smart products.",
      "Unsupported devices lose security updates. If you cannot isolate the thermostat on your network, consider upgrading to a model that still receives patches.",
      "Pro Tip: Reduce your footprint with a data removal service",
      "A data removal service can help you cut down on the amount of personal information available to data brokers. This adds another layer of privacy that supports your smart home security.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Smartphone banking has made life easier, but it has also opened new opportunities for cybercriminals.",
      "Over the past few years, we have seen Android malware steal passwords, intercept OTPs and even take remote control of phones to drain accounts. Some scams focus on fake banking apps, while others rely on phishing messages that trick you into entering sensitive details.",
      "Security researchers have now discovered a new threat that goes a step further. Instead of simply stealing login information, this malware gives thieves the ability to walk up to an ATM and withdraw your money in real time.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Android malware like NGate tricks users into downloading fake banking apps that steal sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the NGate malware works",
      "The Polish Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT Polska) discovered a new Android malware called NGate that uses NFC activity to access a victim's bank account. This malware monitors contactless payment actions on the victim's phone and forwards all transaction data, including the PIN, directly to a server controlled by attackers. It does not just copy card details. Instead, it waits until the victim taps to pay or performs a verification step, then captures the fresh, one-time authentication codes that modern Visa and Mastercard chips generate.",
      "To pull this off, attackers need to infect the phone first. They typically send phishing messages claiming there is a security problem with the victim's bank account. These messages often push people to download a fake banking app from a non-official source. Once the victim installs it, the app walks them through fake verification prompts and requests permissions that allow it to read NFC activity. As soon as the victim taps their phone or enters their PIN, the malware captures everything the ATM needs to validate a withdrawal.",
      "MANAGE ANDROID APPS WITH THE NEW 'UNINSTALL' BUTTON",
      "Once installed, the malware captures NFC tap-to-pay codes and PINs the moment the victim uses their phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What attackers do with the stolen data at the ATM",
      "The attackers rely on speed. The one-time codes generated during an NFC transaction are valid for only a short period. As soon as the infected phone captures the data, the information is uploaded to the attacker's server. An accomplice waits near an ATM, holding a device capable of emulating a contactless card. This could be another phone, a smartwatch or custom NFC hardware.",
      "When the data arrives, the accomplice presents the card-emulating device at the ATM. Since the information contains fresh, valid authentication codes and the correct PIN, the machine treats it like a real card. The ATM authorizes the withdrawal because everything appears to match a legitimate transaction. All of this happens without the criminal ever touching the victim's physical card. Everything depends on timing, planning and getting the victim to unknowingly complete the transaction on their own phone.",
      "Criminals use the stolen, time-limited codes at an ATM to make real withdrawals without the victim\u2019s card. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from Android NGate malware",
      "As attacks like NGate become more sophisticated, staying safe comes down to a mix of good digital habits and a few simple tools that protect your phone and your financial data.",
      "Most malicious banking apps spread through direct links sent in texts or emails. These links lead to APK files hosted on random servers. When you install apps only from the Play Store, you get Google's built-in security checks. Play Protect regularly scans apps for malware and removes harmful ones from your device. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices. Even if attackers send convincing messages, avoid installing anything from outside the official store. If your bank wants you to update an app, you will always find it on the Play Store.",
      "One careless tap on a fake bank alert can hand criminals everything they need. Strong antivirus software can stop most threats before they cause damage. It scans new downloads, blocks unsafe links and alerts you when an app behaves in ways that could expose your financial data. Many threats like NGate rely on fake banking apps, so having real-time scanning turned on gives you an early warning if something suspicious tries to install itself.",

      "Security patches fix vulnerabilities that attackers use to hijack permission settings or read sensitive data. Updates also improve how Android monitors NFC and payment activity. Turn on automatic updates for both the operating system and apps, especially banking and payment apps. A fully updated device closes many of the holes that malware tries to exploit.",
      "Phishing attacks often direct you to fake websites or fake app login pages that look identical to the real thing. A password manager saves your credentials and fills them in only when the website or app is authentic. If it refuses to autofill, it is a clear sign that you are on a fake page. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication gives you a second layer of protection, even if your password is compromised. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS codes because they cannot be intercepted as easily. For banking apps, enabling 2FA adds friction for attackers trying to perform unauthorized actions. Combined with strong passwords from a password manager, it significantly reduces the chance of account takeover.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency to trick you. They often claim that your card is blocked, your account is frozen or a payment needs verification. These messages push you to act fast and install a fake app. Always pause and check your bank's official channels. Contact the bank through verified customer care numbers or the official app. Never click links or open attachments in unsolicited messages, even if they look legitimate.",
      "Most people install apps and forget about them. Over time, unused apps pile up with unnecessary permissions that increase risk. Open your phone's permission settings and check what each app can access. If a simple tool asks for access to NFC, messages or accessibility features, uninstall it. Attackers exploit these excessive permissions to monitor your activity or capture data without your knowledge.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals are now combining social engineering with the secure hardware features inside modern payment systems. The malware does not break NFC security. Instead, it tricks you into performing a real transaction and steals the one-time codes at that moment. This makes the attack difficult to spot and even harder to reverse once the withdrawal goes through. The best defense is simple awareness. If a bank ever urges you to download an app from outside the Play Store, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Keeping your phone clean is now as important as keeping your physical card safe.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Google is sounding the alarm for Android users after uncovering a wave of fake VPN apps that sneak malware onto phones and tablets. These dangerous apps pose as privacy tools but hide info stealers, banking trojans and remote access malware designed to loot personal data.",
      "More people are relying on VPNs to protect their privacy, secure home networks and shield personal information while using public Wi-Fi. Attackers know this demand is growing. They use it to lure users into downloading convincing VPN lookalikes that contain hidden malware.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "Fake VPN apps are spreading across Android devices by posing as trusted privacy tools. (iStock)",
      "How fake VPN apps lure users",
      "Cybercriminals create malicious VPN apps that impersonate trusted brands. They use sexually suggestive ads, geopolitical headlines or fake privacy claims to push people into quick downloads. Google says many of these campaigns run across app stores and shady websites.",
      "DELETE THE FAKE VPN APP STEALING ANDROID USERS' MONEY",
      "Once installed, these apps inject malware that steals passwords, messages and financial details. Attackers can hijack accounts, drain bank balances or lock devices with ransomware. Some campaigns even use professional ad creatives and influencer-style promotions to appear legitimate.",
      "Scammers now use AI tools to design ads, phishing pages and fake brands with alarming speed. This gives them the power to reach large groups of victims with very little effort.",
      "Why malicious VPN apps are spreading",
      "Fake VPN apps remain one of the most effective tools for attackers. These apps request sensitive permissions and often run silently in the background. Once active, they can collect browsing data, cryptocurrency wallet details or private messages.",
      "According to Google, the most dangerous apps pretend to be known enterprise VPNs or premium privacy tools. Many promote themselves through adult ads, push notifications and cloned social media accounts.",
      "How to recognize a genuine VPN app",
      "Google recommends installing VPN services only from trusted sources. In Google Play, legitimate VPNs include a verified VPN badge to show that the app passed an authenticity check.",
      "A real VPN will never ask for access to your contacts, photos or private messages. It will not ask you to sideload updates or follow outside links for installation.",
      "Be careful with free VPN claims. Many free privacy tools rely on excessive data collection or hide malware inside downloadable files.",
      "Ways to stay safe from fake VPN apps",
      "Staying ahead of these fake VPN scams starts with a few smart habits that make your device much harder for attackers to target.",
      "Stick to the Google Play Store. Avoid links from ads, pop-ups or messages that try to rush you. Many fake VPN campaigns depend on off-platform downloads because they cannot pass the Play Store security checks.",
      "Google now includes a special VPN badge that verifies an app has passed an authenticity review. This badge confirms that the developer followed strict guidelines and that the app went through additional screening.",
      "If you want a reliable VPN that has already been vetted for security and performance, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Malicious VPN apps often target information already floating around the web, including your email, phone number and personal details exposed through data brokers. A trusted data removal service can help pull your information from people-search sites and broker databases, which reduces the amount of data scammers can use against you. This limits the damage if a fake VPN app steals your info or if attackers try to match stolen data with public records to build convincing scams.",
      "CAN YOU BE TRACKED WHEN USING A VPN?",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Once installed, these lookalike VPN apps steal passwords, messages and financial details. (iStock)",

      "Google Play Protect, which is built-in malware protection for Android devices, automatically removes known malware. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all emerging malware from Android devices.",
      "Settings may vary depending on your Android phone\u2019s manufacturer",
      "How to turn it on: Open Google Play Store \u2192 Tap your profile icon \u2192 Select Play Protect \u2192 Tap Settings \u2192 Turn on Scan apps with Play Protect \u2192 Turn on Improve harmful app detection.",
      "While Google Play Protect offers a helpful first layer of defense, it is not a full antivirus. A strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection. It can block malicious downloads, detect hidden malware and warn you when an app acts in unusual ways. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com",
      "A genuine VPN only needs network-related permissions. If a VPN asks for access to photos, contacts or messages, treat it as a major warning sign. Restrict permissions when possible.",
      "Sideloaded apps bypass Google's security filters. Attackers often hide malware inside APK files or update prompts that promise extra features. If you're unfamiliar with the term, sideloading means installing apps outside the Google Play Store, usually by downloading a file from a website, email or message. These apps never go through Google's safety checks, which makes them far riskier to install.",
      "Fake VPN ads often claim your device is already infected or that your connection is not secure. Real privacy apps do not use panic-based marketing.",
      "Look up the developer's website and reviews. A legitimate VPN provider will have a clear privacy policy, customer support and a consistent history of app updates.",
      "Free VPNs often rely on risky data practices or hide malware. If a service promises premium features at no cost, question how it pays its bills.",
      "DO YOU NEED A VPN AT HOME? HERE ARE 10 REASONS YOU DO",
      "If someone contacts you claiming they can recover stolen money, cut contact. Real agencies never demand upfront fees and never request remote access to your device.",
      "Install security patches as soon as they appear. Updates protect your phone from malware strains that rely on old software vulnerabilities.",
      "Scammers now use AI-generated ads and fake brands to trick you into quick downloads. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake VPN apps are becoming a major threat to Android users as scammers exploit the rising demand for privacy tools and home network security. Attackers hide behind familiar logos, aggressive ads and AI-powered campaigns to push apps that steal data the moment you install them. Staying safe requires careful downloading habits, attention to permissions and a healthy amount of skepticism toward anything that claims instant privacy or premium features for free.",

      "Could the Klein Vision AirCar redefine the future of travel? Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses.",
      "Archer Aviation, a leading developer of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, just made one of its boldest moves yet. The company agreed to acquire Hawthorne Airport for $126 million in cash.",
      "According to Archer's latest shareholder letter, the deal includes the remaining 30 years on the airport's master lease and an exclusive option to take a controlling stake in the on-site fixed-base operator, subject to city approval.",
      "This historic 80-acre site includes about 190,000 square feet of terminals, office space and hangars. Its location near LAX and major Los Angeles destinations makes it a prime spot for an air taxi network that aims to change how people move in crowded cities.",

      "PENNSYLVANIA BILL SEEKS TO LEGALIZE FLYING CARS",
      "A rendering of Archer\u2019s development plans for Hawthorne Airport in Los Angeles. (Archer Aviation)",
      "Why Hawthorne Airport matters for the new air taxi network",
      "Archer Aviation plans to use the airport as the main operational hub for its LA air taxi network. The company also plans to prepare the site to support transportation during the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This includes managing everything from takeoff scheduling to ground operations. In its shareholder letter, Archer frames Hawthorne as a \"plug-and-play\" anchor hub for its LA28 Olympic plans, saying it expects to ramp up aircraft testing, storage, maintenance and charging on-site as it prepares for commercial service.",
      "The airport will also become a test bed for next-generation AI-powered aviation systems. These tools will help Archer develop smarter air traffic management, faster turnaround times and safer operations in crowded airspace.",
      "Archer outlines a two-phase plan in the letter. Phase 1 focuses on redeveloping up to 200,000 square feet of hangars and locking in control of the FBO, while Phase 2 layers in AI air traffic and ground management, smart sensor-embedded runways and a more digital, streamlined passenger experience.",
      "United Airlines CFO Michael Leskinen praised the move and said,\u00a0\"Archer's trajectory validates our conviction that eVTOLs are part of the next generation of air traffic technology that will fundamentally reshape aviation. Their vision for an AI-enabled operations platform isn't just about eVTOLs, it's also about leveraging cutting-edge technology to better enable moving people safely and efficiently in our most congested airspaces. Through United's investment arm, United Airlines Ventures, we're investing in companies like Archer that pioneer technologies that will define and support aviation infrastructure for decades to come.\"",

      "Archer plans to turn Hawthorne Airport into the main hub for its LA air taxi network. (Archer Aviation)",
      "Neighbors outraged over \u2018AI air taxi\u2019 takeover",
      "Not everyone is cheering Archer's plan to turn Hawthorne into a flagship hub for AI-guided flying taxis. A local group called Hawthorne Quiet Skies, made up of residents living around the airport, says it was blindsided by the $126 million takeover and that no one from the company or city bothered to engage it before announcing a \"test bed for AI-powered aviation technologies\" over homes.",
      "Neighbors who live just across the street and within a couple of blocks of the runway describe Hawthorne as one of the most tightly packed airports in the country, with homes on three sides and years of complaints about deafening jet and helicopter noise. The city's own 2021 noise study identified more than 160 homes and roughly 480 people already exposed to unhealthy noise levels, yet residents say there has been \"zero progress\" on mitigation even as the airport shifted from small private planes to commercial traffic and now an around-the-clock eVTOL hub.",
      "The group is also raising alarms about Archer's AI ambitions, pointing to academic research that current machine-learning systems in aviation still struggle to handle unusual conditions and lack formal safety guarantees.",
      "They argue that whatever the promises of cleaner, futuristic air taxis, Hawthorne is being used as a live test site without clear safeguards, updated federal noise rules or any serious plan to compensate families if nonstop eVTOL traffic makes their homes too loud to live in.",
      "CHINA\u2019S FIRST MASS-PRODUCED FLYING CAR DEBUTS",
      "How Archer Aviation is funding growth and expanding its air taxi program",
      "Alongside the airport news, Archer reported major financial momentum. The company raised an additional $650 million in equity, which boosted its total liquidity to more than $2 billion. The company's Midnight aircraft also hit new flight milestones, including a 55-mile flight at over 126 mph and a climb to 10,000 feet.",
      "Archer also expanded its global technology footprint. It completed the acquisition of Lilium's patent portfolio, which pushes Archer's total intellectual property to more than 1,000 global assets. Those patents cover ducted fans, high voltage systems, flight controls and other key technologies.",
      "International expansion is underway, too. Archer began test and demo flights in the UAE and secured new partnerships with Korean Air and with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo's JV in Osaka and Tokyo.",
      "The airport will serve as a test bed for next-generation AI aviation systems designed to manage busy airspace more safely. (Archer Aviation)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Archer's airport deal suggests that air taxis are moving closer to everyday use. This shift could mean shorter trips across major cities at a fraction of today's travel time. It could also bring quieter aircraft over neighborhoods compared to helicopters.",
      "For Los Angeles residents, Hawthorne Airport may become a central point for fast point-to-point travel once certification moves forward. Visitors flying in for major events like the LA28 Olympics could see air taxis as a smooth alternative to gridlocked freeways.",
      "Businesses may gain new options for rapid transport across the region. The move also signals more investment and jobs in advanced aviation, automation and clean electric travel.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Archer's acquisition of Hawthorne Airport marks a major milestone in the race to build a real air taxi network, giving the company the aircraft, funding and prime location it needs to push the industry forward. Its focus on AI-driven operations shows how automated aviation may soon play a much bigger role in daily life, even as regulators are still working out how to safely integrate these aircraft into crowded cities. At the same time, the move is already sparking backlash from neighbors who worry about more noise and safety risks and being turned into a test site for AI-guided aircraft without a real say. If Archer can win over regulators, investors and the communities living just beyond the fence line, this step could make the future of urban flight feel much closer, for better or worse.",

For every legitimate application that solves a real problem, there are dozens of knockoffs waiting to exploit brand recognition and user trust. We've seen it happen with games, productivity tools and entertainment apps. Now, artificial intelligence has become the latest battleground for digital impostors.",
      "The AI boom has created an unprecedented gold rush in mobile app development, and opportunistic actors are cashing in. AI-related mobile apps collectively account for billions of downloads, and that massive user base has attracted a new wave of clones.

      "What you need to know about the fake AI apps",
      "The fake apps flooding app stores exist on a spectrum of harm, and understanding that range is crucial before you download any AI tools. Take the \"DALL\u00b7E 3 AI Image Generator\" found on Aptoide. It presents itself as an OpenAI product, complete with branding that mimics the real thing. When you open it, you see a loading screen that looks like an AI model generating an image. But nothing is actually being generated.",
      "Network analysis by Appknox showed the app connects only to advertising and analytics services. There's no AI functionality, just an illusion designed to collect your data for monetization.",
      "Then there are apps like WhatsApp Plus, which are far more dangerous. Disguised as an upgraded version of Meta's messenger, this app hides a complete malware framework capable of surveillance, credential theft and persistent background execution. It's signed with a fake certificate instead of WhatsApp's legitimate key and uses a tool often used by malware authors to encrypt malicious code.",
      "Once installed, it silently requests extensive permissions, including access to your contacts, SMS, call logs, device accounts and messages. These permissions allow it to intercept one-time passwords, scrape your address book and impersonate you in chats. Hidden libraries keep the code running even after you close the app. Network logs show it uses domain fronting to disguise its traffic behind Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud endpoints.",
      "Not every clone is malicious. Some apps identify themselves as unofficial interfaces and connect directly to real APIs. The problem is that you often can't tell the difference between a harmless wrapper and a malicious impersonator until it's too late.",
      "Clones hide spyware that can access messages, passwords and contacts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "When a malicious app steals credentials while using your brand's identity, customers don't just lose data but also lose trust. Research shows customers stop buying from a brand after a major breach. The average cost of a data breach now stands at 4.45 million dollars, according to IBM's 2025 report. In regulated sectors like finance and healthcare, such breaches can lead to violations of GDPR, HIPAA and PCI-DSS, with fines reaching up to 4% of global turnover.",

      "While the threat landscape continues to evolve, there are practical measures you can take to protect yourself from malicious clones and impersonators.",
      "A quality mobile security solution can detect and block malicious apps before they cause damage. Modern antivirus programs scan apps for suspicious behavior, unauthorized permissions and known malware signatures. This first line of defense is especially important as fake apps become more sophisticated in hiding their true intentions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Apps like WhatsApp Plus specifically target credentials and can intercept passwords typed directly into fake interfaces. A password manager autofills credentials only on legitimate sites and apps, making it significantly harder for impostors to capture your login information through phishing or fake app interfaces.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Given that malicious clones can steal personal information, intercept SMS verification codes and even impersonate users in chats, identity theft protection provides an additional safety net. These services monitor for unauthorized use of your personal information and can alert you if your identity is being misused across various platforms and services.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "While some sophisticated malware can intercept SMS codes,\u00a02FA still adds a critical layer of security. Use authenticator apps rather than SMS when possible, as they're harder to compromise. Even if a fake app captures your password, 2FA makes it significantly more difficult for attackers to access your accounts.",
      "Security patches often address vulnerabilities that malicious apps exploit. Regular updates to your operating system and legitimate apps ensure you have the latest protections against known threats. Enable automatic updates when possible to stay protected without having to remember manual checks.",
      "Stick to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store rather than third-party marketplaces. While fake apps can still appear on official platforms, these stores have security review processes and are more responsive to removing malicious applications once they're identified. Third-party app stores often have minimal or no security vetting.",
      "Check the developer name carefully. Official ChatGPT apps come from OpenAI, not random developers with similar names. Look at the number of downloads, read recent reviews and be suspicious of apps with few ratings or reviews that seem generic. Legitimate AI tools from major companies will have verified developer badges and millions of downloads.",
      "Even if you avoid downloading fake apps, your personal information may already be circulating on data broker sites that scammers rely on. These brokers collect and sell details like your name, phone number, home address and app usage data, information that cybercriminals can use to craft convincing phishing messages or impersonate you.",
      "A trusted data removal service scans hundreds of broker databases and automatically submits removal requests on your behalf. Regularly removing your data helps reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for malicious actors and fake app networks to target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy.

      "\"In trying to sell a car, it has become apparent that there is a scam related to CarFax-type reports,\" Nick wrote in an email to us. \"The way it works is a guy texts or emails saying they are interested in your car, but they say they must have a car report from a specific service. At first, I thought it was just a way for a guy to sell more reports, but after thinking about it for a while, it seems like it could be a great way to harvest credit card numbers, etc. I have not been a victim of this, but in the course of selling a car recently, I had several instances of this. There are several warning signs: \u2018Will you accept cash?\u2019 Questions indicating they have not read the ad. Offering more than the ad asks for. Short nonsensical first contact.

      "How the Craigslist car report scam works",
      "This scam often starts with a message that looks completely normal. A supposed buyer texts asking something like, \"1985 F150 Available?\" and quickly follows up with friendly but vague questions such as,\u00a0\"OK, I'm interested in seeing it. When and where would be good for you?\"",
      "Once you respond, the \"buyer\" develops just enough rapport to sound legitimate. Then comes the setup. The \"buyer\" says he is serious about purchasing but wants to see a detailed ASR report first, something most sellers have never heard of.",
      "That's exactly what happened to Nick K. After he shared the Craigslist link and vehicle details, the fake buyer sent this reply:",
      "\"Auto Smart Report, here's the link you can get the papers from. Oh, I forgot to ask for your name? I'm Richard. Will you accept a cash payment? Let me know.\"",
      "It sounds harmless, even reassuring. But the scam hinges on getting you to click that link. The site looks professional, promising a \"Complete Vehicle History at Your Fingertips.\" Yet once you enter your information, you're not buying a report; you're handing over your credit card details and personal data to criminals.",
      "When the seller, in this case, pushed back, the scammer doubled down with more pressure tactics.",
      "\"If you can show me the Auto Smart Report, that would be great, as it's the most reliable and complete report. My offer to you is $7,000. I have no issue with that.\"\u00a0Notice the scammer just increased the amount that he is willing to pay for the vehicle by $500.",
      "They'll say anything to keep you engaged and make the transaction sound routine. But the moment you pay for the fake report, the buyer disappears. His only goal is to harvest your financial information, not purchase your vehicle.",

      "The case involving two Wisconsin women convicted of brutally stabbing their sixth-grade classmate over a decade ago to appease horror character Slender Man has continued to unravel after one of the perpetrators escaped from a group home last weekend.",
      "In 2014, Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12 at the time, were charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide after prosecutors revealed the pair executed a planned attack to try to kill their middle school classmate, Payton Leutner.",
      "The brutal attack played out the morning of May 31, 2014, after Leutner and Weier slept over at Geyser\u2019s home to celebrate her birthday. When the three girls awoke, Geyser and Weier lured Leutner into a suburban park, where Geyser stabbed the girl 19 times as Weier egged her on.",

      "The pair later admitted to investigators that they carried out the attack in order to become one of Slender Man\u2019s servants and because they were afraid he would hurt their families if they did not kill Leutner.",
      "\"Internet mythology, like Slender Man, can contribute to distorted perceptions of reality, as it did in this case,\" Dr. Carole Lieberman, a forensic psychiatrist, told Fox News Digital. \"Children and early adolescents are particularly susceptible to such characters.\"",
      "Geyser subsequently pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide and was ordered to spend 40 years in a psychiatric institute in 2018, after being diagnosed with schizophrenia.",
      "Her co-defendant, Weier, also pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree intentional homicide, and was initially sent to a psychiatric center until she was granted release in 2021. She lives with her father and wears a GPS monitor.",
      "However, earlier this year, a Wisconsin judge determined Geyser was mentally fit to be released from the center and ordered her to live in a group home, located in nearby Madison, following multiple failed attempts by Geyser\u2019s legal team to secure her freedom.",
      "The decision came after three doctors involved in Geyser\u2019s treatment testified that she had made significant progress and should be released, pointing to reports that she had suffered no symptoms after being weaned off her antipsychotic medication and that she had improved her coping skills, according to The Associated Press.",

      "Morgan Geyser was taken into custody in Posen, Illinois, on Sunday, Nov. 23, 2025, after escaping from a group home in Wisconsin. (Posen Police Department)",
      "Dr. Ken Robbins testified that Geyser could actually become more dangerous if she remained confined to the center, saying that it is possible for her to become defeated with her treatment and lose hope.",
      "\"The longer she\u2019s there, at this point, the harder it\u2019s going to be to re-integrate,\" Robbins said.",
      "The decision came after significant protest from the prosecution, as Waukesha County Assistant District Attorney Ted Szczupakiewicz argued Geyser previously claimed that she faked her delusions regarding Slender Man and actually attempted to kill Leutner to escape her abusive father.",
      "\"Geyser was especially vulnerable to Slender Man because she was [abused] by her father,\" Lieberman said. \"In her schizophrenic state, with altered perceptions of reality, she saw Slender Man, who was tall with lots of long hands, as an embodiment of her father, because that\u2019s what a father would have looked like to a little child being abused. She may well have believed that if she killed Payton, and gave her to Slender Man as an offering, her real life father would stop abusing her.\"",
      "Prosecutors also pointed to a previous incident in which Geyser failed to reveal to her treatment team that she was reading a novel about black-market organ sales and murder. Additionally, prosecutors alleged that Geyser was corresponding with a man who is a murder memorabilia collector and previously sent him a sketch of a decapitated body along with a postcard revealing she wanted to be intimate with him.",
      "However, the judge ultimately determined that it is not uncommon for mental illness diagnoses to evolve and released Geyser into a group home.",

      "\"Geyser should never have been released from the psychiatric hospital she was in,\" Lieberman told Fox News Digital. \"There were many signs that her schizophrenia had not yet\u00a0been sufficiently treated.\"",
      "Lieberman went on to point to the apparent warning signs that Geyser had not been fully rehabilitated.",
      "\"These were all signs \u2013 and there were undoubtedly more \u2013 that she was still wrestling with who she was and needed more treatment,\" Lieberman said.",
      "Less than one year after her release to a group home, Geyser removed her GPS monitoring device and snuck out of the Wisconsin group home, the Madison Police Department said.",
      "According to authorities, Geyser was last seen alongside a male companion at approximately 8 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 22. Her escape prompted a multi-state manhunt, with authorities releasing recent photos of her in an attempt to track her down.",
      "One day later, authorities in Posen, Illinois \u2013 located roughly 25 miles south of Chicago \u2013 received a report regarding a male and female loitering behind a truck stop.",

      "Following multiple attempts to identify her, Geyser admitted she didn\u2019t want to tell officers her name because she had \"done something really bad\" and suggested the officers \"just Google\" her.",
      "She then provided authorities with a fake name.",
      "After a short back-and-forth, Geyser could be seen writing her name down on a piece of paper, which ultimately led to authorities taking her into custody. As she was being handcuffed, Geyser could be heard making an emotional plea to the officers to say goodbye to her companion, insisting that the individual did not know who she was and that she \"will never see her again.\"",

      "\"Leutner was undoubtedly re-traumatized by this ill-conceived and flawed plan to release Geyser,\" Lieberman told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"At one of the hearings, the hospital was originally planning to send Geyser to a group home that was very close to where Leutner lived, which would have been extremely dangerous. The news of Geyser\u2019s escape re-traumatized Leutner by reminding her of how out of control Geyser is and by terrifying her that Geyser would try to finish her off.\"",

      "Washington has long debated whether the Brotherhood is a unified global movement or a loose network of national branches with different agendas and levels of militancy. That dispute stalled previous attempts to designate the group. Trump\u2019s order bypasses that debate and directs federal agencies to examine individual chapters that analysts say already meet the legal thresholds.",
      "Mariam Wahba, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said in a statement that the directive \"replaces years of debate with concrete action\" and forces U.S. agencies to assess Brotherhood entities that function as \"real organizations with leadership structures, financing channels and documented ties to terrorist groups.\" She said the order \"treats Islamist actors according to their behavior, not their branding.\"",
      "Across the Arab world, the Brotherhood has been banned for years. Egypt outlawed it in 2013 after accusing the movement of radicalization and efforts to undermine state institutions. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates designated it soon after, calling it a direct threat to national stability. Bahrain issued similar findings.

In the United States, Brotherhood-linked organizations function through charities, advocacy centers, mosques, student associations and community groups.

The Brotherhood promoted Islam\u2014according to experts\u2014as the solution to modern political crises and relied on outreach, services and media to expand its base. Influential thinkers like Sayyid Qutb later inspired jihadist movements such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State group.",
      "Although the Brotherhood historically maintained a symbolic \"general guide\" in Egypt, the movement now operates as a decentralized network across the Middle East, Africa, Europe and North America. Wahba noted that this fragmentation explains why earlier U.S. attempts to impose a blanket designation failed. Instead, Trump\u2019s order adopts the model used when the United States designated Hamas, the Brotherhood\u2019s Gaza branch, in 1997: target the components \"that engage in violence, not the ideology itself.\"",
      "The decision also comes amid growing Israeli concern about a resurgent Islamist bloc backed by Turkey and Qatar.

      "Hanson arrived in the full-face covering shortly after being denied permission to introduce her bill seeking to ban burqas and other face coverings in public. The move prompted shouting across the chamber as senators demanded she remove the garment. Senate leaders eventually halted the session when she refused to do so.",
      "Leaders from both major parties condemned the stunt. Labor Senate leader and Foreign Minister Penny Wong described Hanson\u2019s display as \"not worthy of a member of the Australian Senate,\" according to Reuters, and moved to suspend her after she refused to comply with instructions to remove the covering.

      "The incident marked the second time Hanson has worn a burqa inside Parliament. The 71-year-old senator first did so in 2017 as part of her longtime campaign against Islamic dress.

She wrote: \"Today I wore a burqa into the Senate after One Nation's bill to ban the burqa and face coverings in public was blocked from even being introduced. The usual hypocrites had an absolute freak out. The fact is more than 20 countries around the world have banned the burqa because they recognize it as a tool that oppresses women, poses a national security risk, encourages radical Islam and threatens social cohesion. If these hypocrites don't want me to wear a burqa, they can always support my ban.\"",
      "Her statement continued, \"So if Parliament won't ban it, I will display this oppressive, radical, nonreligious head garb that risks our national security and the ill treatment of women on the floor of our Parliament so that every Australian knows what's at stake. If they don't want me wearing it, ban the burqa.\"",

      "JOHANNESBURG: The White House has mounted a new verbal attack\u00a0on South Africa over the G-20 Leaders' Summit in Johannesburg this weekend. White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly hit back at South African President Cyril Ramaphosa after Pretoria refused to allow a U.S. embassy delegation to take part in the summit\u2019s closing ceremony.",
      "The U.S. takes over the G-20\u2019s presidency next year. But Ramaphosa\u2019s spokesperson\u00a0told reporters here at the summit their president won\u2019t perform the ceremonial handover to a junior diplomat. Washington had asked to send the embassy\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires to the ceremony.",
      "In what is becoming an increasingly fractious back-and-forth of bitter statements between Pretoria and Washington on several issues around the G-20, Kelly told Fox News Digital, \"President Ramaphosa initially declared that he would pass the gavel to an \u2018empty chair.\u2019 Now, he\u2019s refusing to facilitate a smooth transition of the G-20 presidency at all.\"",

Bove denied the accusations during Senate confirmation hearings for his nomination to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. \"I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,\" he said.",

But Boasberg is pushing to get to the bottom of what happened on March 15 and why his orders weren\u2019t followed. An appeals court allowed him to continue with contempt proceedings this month.",

      "Brendan Fraser's new film, \u201cRental Family,\u201d explores belonging, authenticity\u00a0and one unconventional business model.",
      "The Oscar winner portrays Phillip, a struggling middle-aged American living in Tokyo taking a number of small gigs in hopes of getting another big break. He then gets an opportunity with a business that forever changes his life: a \"rental family\" agency.",
      "Essentially, actors like Philip get paid to play stand-in roles in strangers' lives. They can get hired to pose as family members, friends, partners, people whom they've had affairs with and now must apologize to their spouses, or whomever the client needs.",
      "\u201cRental Family\u201d is not based on a true story. However, it does bring to light the very real family rental businesses in Japan.",
      "Director Hikari tells TODAY.com that upon learning of the services, she discovered \u201cthat people are really longing for connection\u201d amid feelings of isolation.",
      "The film shows an initially hesitant Phillip after he gets hired as a stand-in-fianc\u00e9 for a woman who wants to stage a wedding so she can move to a different country with her female partner.",
      "He is also \u201cbooked\u201d to fill in the role of a long-lost father for a young girl named Mia (Shannon Mahina Gorman). Her, mother Hitomi (Shino Shinozaki), believes if her daughter has a complete family, her chances at being accepted into a prestigious school will be better.",
      "Then, the daughter of an aging Japanese actor, Kikuo (Akira Emoto), hires Philip to pose as a journalist and interview him before he loses his memory. While he pretends to write a story about the former star, they begin to form a friendship.",
      "In 2018, director Hikari began exploring the \u201crent-a-family industry\u201d and discovered that it started in the \u201880s.",
      "\u201cCurrently there are about 300 companies that exist in Japan,\u201d the director said in press notes. \u201cIn a big city like Tokyo, or even a countryside town, you can feel so isolated. \u2026 Every single person I spoke to was looking for connection. Even though they\u2019re paying for the service, they find a friendship within that two or three hours they spend together. And the actors who become the surrogates, they are also 100% invested in the relationship and find their own connection in the community. The roles may seem fake but the emotion is real.\u201d",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com, Hikari recalls the moment she knew rental services were \u201creally doing something very important to people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "There was a man that couldn\u2019t get in touch with his daughter for a long time, she says, \u201cand before he passed away, he really wanted to reconnect, but he couldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo he hired somebody who looked like his daughter and asked her to come to the hospital so that he (could) apologize and say how much he loved her before he passed away,\u201d she says.",
      "Actor Mari Yamamoto, who portrays rental family agency employee Aiko, believes that people are looking for \u201ca temporary solution\u201d when they rent somebody.",
      "Telling TODAY.com, \u201cWhat starts out as a transactional relationship turns into something genuine. And I think that\u2019s the beauty of this service. The people that we\u2019ve spoken to who actually work in this industry have told us stories of how they get so much out of providing this service.\u201d",
      "Ryuichi Ichinokawa, founder of real life Heart Project business in Japan, told the Associated Press that he\u2019s hired dozens of people to pretend to be journalists for vacant events and people to pose as significant others and accompany them for special events or appointments, as well as pretend family members.",
      "\u201cI am being of service to people. I hope they will be happy,\u201d Ichinokawa told the publication, stressing that clients find the service comforting and healing. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I am acting. I really get angry if that\u2019s what the situation requires.\u201d",
      "Actor Takehiro Hira, who portrays Shinji, the owner of the rental family, calls the services a step to healing in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cSometimes it becomes too much. Sometimes (they) just can\u2019t take it anymore. So rather than going to seek professional help... and you might be shy, then you can rent and use services like this to do the patchwork on the wound.\u201d",
      "Hira also spoke to someone who works at an agency and got a request from an older lady seeking the services of a younger person.",
      "\u201cJust to sleep in the next room so that she would feel safe and comfortable,\u201d the actor says. \u201cI have an 80-year-old some mother living by herself in Tokyo and she doesn\u2019t ask me to come back home. But maybe on some lonely night she might feel (scared), so that sort of puts everything in context.\u201d",
      "Miwa Yasui, a University of Chicago professor who also researches how culture influences mental health, told AP that Japan has grappled with loneliness, high suicide rates and mental illness stigma. Yasui noted that Japan as a collective culture tends to hide mental health challenges and adults are pressured to maintain harmony and take care of the family.",
      "Additionally, Chikako Ozawa-de Silva, author of \u201cThe Anatomy of Loneliness: Suicide, Social Connection and the Search for Relational Meaning in Contemporary Japan\u201d and a professor at Emory University, also told AP that the rental family business puts a \"band-aid\" on a deeper problem.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not against that,\u201d Ozawa-de Silva said. \u201cIf people can buy time by renting a family, while pursuing much better long-term solutions, I think the rental family could be a very, very beneficial thing.\u201d",
      "Hikari's goal was to make audiences ask themselves the role they would hire someone to play in their lives, as well as share a reminder to connect with real people.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to make a movie that connects the audience,\u201d she shares with TODAY.com. \u201cAnd have them look within themselves or pick up the phone and say, \u2018Hey, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d",
      "She also wanted people to understand the nuances of the business and how it could be interpreted in different countries.",
      "\u201cHere in America too, there are people who volunteer to be beside somebody who\u2019s elderly, who wants somebody to hold their hand and watch them go to the next journey,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very different but I think every culture has certain things that are (similar).\u201d",
      "What Hikari says is most \u201cbeautiful\u201d is that people just want \u201cto be there for each other.\u201d"

    "summary": "In an interview Malala Yousafzai speaks about her new memoir, friendship, marriage, and her life since being shot by the Talbian.",
    "story": [
      "Over a decade after being shot in the head on a bus in Pakistan and becoming a global activist for women\u2019s rights in the Middle East, Malala Yousafzai is reintroducing herself \u2014 in her own words.",
      "\u201cThere is more to my life,\u201d she tells TODAY.com, explaining that her new memoir, \u201cFinding My Way,\u201d explores her \u201cjourney through college years, making friends, finding love and learning more about my activism and talking about mental health.\u201d",
      "She says it was \u201cimportant for people to know the true me\" through her book: \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the activist perfect version of me. It\u2019s the more real version of me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy story has already been out there in the public eye, and I think it\u2019s a very one-dimensional story that is related to something that happened to me at age 15,\u201d she continues. \u201cI had been defined by the Taliban shooting for such a long time, I wanted to share more about myself.\u201d",
      "In October 2012, Yousafzai was the victim of targeted shooting by members of the Taliban, following years of public activism and national recognition in Pakistan. The shooting drew global attention and further ignited Yousafzai\u2019s activism, leading her to be named among TIME magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Most Influential People in the World\u201d in 2013. The following year, at the age of 17, Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for young people\u2019s education rights.",
      "When asked what she finds is the most misunderstood part of her story, Yousafzai says, \u201cthat I am actually a funnier person than people think.\u201d",
      "\u201cI actually like to have moments of laughter and joy,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is one of the ways in which I cope with the workload and all that I have experienced. I like spreading joy.\u201d",
      "Prior to the shooting that altered the course of her life, Yousafzai says she was \u201cthis jolly and fun, entertaining\u201d kid growing up in Pakistan \u2014 adding she was even \u201ca bit mischievous\u201d and \u201cliked to get into trouble.\u201d",
      "But once she moved to the United Kingdom to attend Oxford University, \u201ceverything changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt that I had to live up to the expectation of being an activist. I received so many awards and titles at such a young age that I thought maybe all of this means I cannot be a normal girl anymore,\u201d Yousafzai explains. \u201cI think I was not true to myself as an activist.\u201d",
      "Starting college, Yousafzai says she had the \u201cwrong perception of what the activist life should look like,\u201d which she assumed meant she didn\u2019t have access to \u201cnormal things,\u201d like making friends and falling in love.",
      "\u201cSomehow you have to be stronger and more courageous at everything. You cannot have moments of breakdowns, moments of self doubt,\u201d she says. She would tell herself in difficult times, \u201c\u2018No, you\u2019re supposed to be brave and strong and you\u2019re not going to feel a different way.\u2019\u201d",
      "Over the course of her time at Oxford, however, Yousafzai\u2019s perceptions were shattered and reconstructed.",
      "She tells TODAY.com, \u201cI fell in love, I made friends, I had a mental health breakdown \u2014 all of those things happened all at once. I felt like I was a different person, and I\u2019m grateful for it because it helped me grow.\u201d",
      "How Friendship, a Bong, Therapy and Love Changed Malala Yousafzai\u2019s Life",
      "When she first arrived at Oxford, Yousafzai says she \u201csigned up for every club and society\u201d to meet as many people as possible, despite it feeling \u201cquite awkward and embarrassing\u201d at the time. She adds, \u201cI do not regret it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI struggled to make friends, I struggled to have these normal moments of joy,\u201d she continues. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made a deliberate choice to actually socialize, to actually choose socializing over studying at college, because I wanted to make friends. I wanted to connect with my old self and somehow relive my childhood in my 20s.\u201d",
      "She assumed her fellow classmates would expect her to be \u201ca very serious, boring person, that I only talk about activism,\u201d Yousafzai says, adding, \u201cI just also thought that people may not approach me, thinking that I have nothing fun to say to be part of their friend circle.\u201d",
      "Feeling the pressure to \u201clive up to the expectation\u201d she thought others already set for her, Yousafzai says she realized that people can \u201cinternalize expectation so much that we lose personal identity.\u201d",
      "She explains she had to \u201cdo a lot of unlearning\u201d around who she thought she was.",
      "Once Yousafzai found her people, the \u201cunlearning\u201d began.",
      "\u201cFriendship actually changed me as a person,\u201d she says, noting that the people she surrounded herself with provided the \u201csafest place\u201d to truly express herself without judgement.",
      "One night when her friends were smoking out of a bong, Yousafzai says she opted to try it for the first time, not expecting to be brought back seven years earlier, to October 2012.",
      "\u201cThat brought back flashbacks of the Taliban attack,\u201d she reveals. \u201cThen, after that, I started getting panic attacks and anxiety, and it went on for months.\u201d",
      "When her friend suggested she see a therapist, Yousafzai says she was reluctant, explaining that conversations around mental health are \u201ctaboo\u201d with \u201ca lot of stigma attached to it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember my first therapy session. I told the therapist all the problems that I had, and then said, \u2018OK, give me the medication. Let\u2019s just fix it,\u2019\u201d Yousafzai says, laughing. \u201cShe helped me understand that this is not how it works. It\u2019s actually a process.\u201d",
      "Through therapy Yousafzai has been able to redefine \u201cbravery and courage,\u201d saying she now understands that \u201cwhen you decide to still do what you believe in, even in these moments of difficulty, maybe that is true courage and bravery.\u201d",
      "Amid her therapy journey, Yousafzai had another curve ball thrown her way, emotionally speaking: She fell in love.",
      "\u201cI was excited, I was thrilled, but I was also scared and worried,\u201d Yousafzai recalls of falling for her now husband, Asser Malik.",
      "In Pakistani culture, a couple is not supposed to live together until they tie the knot, she explains. Because she wanted to live with Malik, Yousafzai says she suddenly had to consider the \u201cheavy and overwhelming\u201d decision around marriage.",
      "\u201cI had been so scared of marriage growing up because I saw girls married off when they were still in school, and it just meant that their future, their dreams, were taken away. But I also knew that marriage has meant more compromises for women from their career and many other things in their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cSomehow, just the concept of marriage as an institution just scared me.\u201d",
      "Along with her research, which included reading a myriad of books by \u201camazing feminist authors,\u201d Yousafzai says specific conversations with Malik ultimately led to her agreeing to marry him \u2014 \u201cand I do not regret it for a second.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew that he was the right person because he had so much respect for me. He made me feel comfortable with myself. Of course, we were in love with each other, but I started loving myself, and that was a big change,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cSo when you are with the right person, life becomes more beautiful.\u201d",
      "Reflecting on 15-Year-Old Malala Yousafzai",
      "It\u2019s been 13 years since Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban at just 15. Now 28, she has a message for that teenage girl.",
      "\u201cMy younger self was very strong and determined, and I want to tell her that I\u2019m still determined, but I have grown beautifully so much in these years,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cI know that there have been moments of difficulty, but all of that has transformed me into the person I am today.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am a young woman and I am really happy with where I am because I am working for the right to education for every girl, because I was also once shot for speaking out for girls, and I was banned from learning,\u201d she continues.",
      "\u201cSo I want to see that change for girls everywhere, that no girl should witness that. And I\u2019m trying to do everything that I can in my capacity to make the world a better place for girls like you.\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding My Way,\u201d Yousafzai\u2019s newest memoir, was released Oct. 21."

I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists, and coworkers who have shared his journey with him,\u201d his wife, Latifa Chambers, wrote on Instagram.",
      "He was best known for songs including \u201cMany Rivers to Cross,\u201d and \u201cThe Harder They Come,\u201d the title song for the movie of the same name from 1972, which featured Cliff. The film\u2019s soundtrack was a major international success and did much to spread the appeal of Jamaican reggae.",
      "Born in Jamaica in 1944, Cliff scored his first local hit aged just 14 with \u201cHurricane Hattie\u201d and would go on to win two Grammy awards and pick up seven nominations.",
      "He was only one of two Jamaicans to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, alongside Bob Marley. He was inducted in 2010, with an introductory speech from Wyclef Jean. An essay commemorating Cliff from writer Rob Bowman said that if he had done nothing but star in \u201cThe Harder They Come,\u201d he would have merited inclusion.",

      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "Marissa Bode first saw \"Wicked\" at the age of 12 after her mother surprised her with tickets to see the Broadway show.",
      "What she didn't know then was that merely a decade later, she'd find herself starring in the big-screen version opposite Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande in a blockbuster that smashed box office records after its release in 2024.",
      "\"I'm so grateful for this experience and \u2014 especially my first ever experience,\" Bode, 25, tells TODAY.com. \"I'm definitely grateful for that ... to be a part of something so big.\"",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d fans will likely remember that Bode\u2019s character, Nessarose, is born unable to walk because her mother ate too many milk flowers during her pregnancy out of fear of having another baby with green skin like Nessarose's maligned sister, Elphaba (Erivo).",
      "The show has been on Broadway since 2003, but, Bode is the first actor who uses a wheelchair to be cast in the role of Nessarose.",
      "In \"Wicked\" Part 1, Bode's character is full of youthful hope and in love with Boq (Ethan Slater), the Munchkin boy she falls for while at a dance at the Ozdust Ballroom, and whom she believes returns her affection.",
      "Fast forward to \"Wicked: For Good. Set one year later, Nessarose is Munchkinland's newest governor, a dark, controlling workaholic who learns Boq, her true love, has actually been pining for Glinda (Grande) the entire time.",
      "It's this betrayal that sets Nessarose up as one of the sequel's villains \u2014 a label Bode says is largely undeserved.",
      "\"I think Nessa is totally misunderstood. I think sometimes people can mix the bigger picture and just write her off as the villain or inherently evil,\" Bode says. \"But I think the point of the film is to really show that all of these characters really have so many layers.\"",
      "In \"Wicked: For Good,\" Nessarose transforms from a happy, young girl to an isolated, cold woman \u2014 a metamorphosis Bode calls \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven the whole dance scene, I think that hit close to home, because I do have other disabled friends where something similar has happened,\u201d Bode explains.",
      "\u201cWhere people are friends with them from a distance or they are asked out, but it\u2019s only for a photo op or something to make the other person feel good type of thing, rather than really caring about them and discarding them when they\u2019re no longer either useful or can benefit them,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Instead of being immoral, Nessarose is simply a product of her circumstances, Bode says.",
      "\"It's her just desperately wanting to hang on to the parts that she feels are good in her life. Wanting to really, so deeply, hold onto the moment of her at the dance, which was one of the happiest nights of her life really,\" she says of her character.",
      "\u201cThen when she finds out that all of it wasn\u2019t true and, in addition to being abandoned by her sister \u2014 or at least that\u2019s how she feels \u2014 and really having nobody left at the end of the day, I think there\u2019s moments of her being like, \u2018Well, I have nothing else to lose,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Nessarose and her estranged sister do briefly reunite after the ousted witch returns to Munchkinland seeking to drum up support for her campaign to restore animals' rights.",
      "After Nessarose confronts Elphaba for her perceived abandonment, she attempts to help Nessarose reunite with Boq. In the process, she makes Nessarose fly, restoring her child-like joy, if only for a brief moment.",
      "The pivotal scene is symbolic in more ways than one.",
      "\u201cI think with a song like \u2018Defying Gravity,\u2019 where one of the lyrics is, \u2018Everyone deserves a chance to fly,\u2019 to me, that\u2019s not just physically flying, it\u2019s also metaphorically and feeling like you\u2019re on top of the world or feeling like you do finally have control of your life in some way and flying on that high,\u201d Bode says.",
      "As for how that felt to film?",
      "\u201cI physically had fun flying in the air. What was most tricky for me was pretending like I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Bode recalls. \u201cI do laugh in it, but going from that and then bringing it back down after, I think was the trick for sure.\u201d",
      "But when she shows Boq that she can fly, he tells her she no longer needs him. He asks if he can leave and profess his love for Glinda.",
      "\"When Boq sees Nessa flying, there's a real clear connection between her and Elphaba in that way,\" Slater tells TODAY.com. \"I think, yes, it's magic, but it's also the kind of power that Elphaba has to fly. So I think that, in some ways, informs where the fear goes.\"",
      "Nessarose reacts by trying to force him to love her \u2014 through magic. She attempts to cast a love spell using Elphaba's Grimmerie, but it results in Boq's heart shrinking. To save his life, Elphaba turns him into the Tin Man of \"The Wizard of Oz\" lore.",
      "The physical transformation into the Tin Man took Slater up to five hours. But Slater suggests Boq remains more similar than different.",
      "\"I think it was really important to me that Boq, pre-transformation, is the same Boq, post-transformation. From his point of view, the world around him is changing, and he's just responding to it,\" Slater says.",
      "Nessarose and Boq both meet tragic fates in \"Wicked.\" Boq loses his humanity, while Nessa dies after Madame Morrible brings a tornado (yes, that tornado) to Oz, resulting in a house falling on her.",
      "But the characters' actors are looking to the future. Slater is set to star in the play \"Marcel on the Train,\" which opens on Broadway Feb. 22.",
      "Bode says she's grateful for the opportunity she's had to be part of something so epic, but at the same time, is ready to move on.",
      "\"I think I'm just someone that can't have the same scenery for too long,\" she explains. \"I love playing around and wearing a number of different hats, so I'm looking forward to the future.\""

      "Warning: This article contains major spoilers for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "The bromance between Jonathan Bailey and Jeff Goldblum is the real deal.",
      "In fact, it's probably best that the co-stars share just about one scene between \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good\" because, like a couple of kids who need to be separated in class, nothing's going to get accomplished as long as they're in the same room.",
      "\"I'm the Robin to his Batman,\" Bailey says of Goldblum to TODAY.com.",
      "\"I'm the Cher to his Sonny,\" Goldblum replies.",
      "Between the two, they're a veritable powerhouse of talent.",
      "Goldblum has been a staple of the big screen starting from his memorable one-liner in \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d back in 1977, to appearing in blockbuster films like \"Independence Day,\" \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" and \"Jurassic Park.\"",
      "Bailey began his career as a stage actor before making headlines as a royal in the Netflix hit \"Bridgerton,\" as well as earning an Emmy nod for his 2023 turn in the series \"Fellow Travelers.\"",
      "Most recently, Bailey joined Goldblum in becoming a \"Jurassic Park\" alum after starring in \"Jurassic World Rebirth\" last summer.",
      "Playing the Wizard of Oz and Prince Fiyero, respectively, Goldblum and Bailey have been traveling the globe for the past couple of weeks promoting \"Wicked: For Good,\" the sequel to last year's box office smash \"Wicked,\" starring Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda.",
      "During what Bailey and Goldblum mourn as their final joint interview of the \"Wicked: For Good\" press tour, the two friends banter, ponder plot points (spoilers ahead!) and discuss why the film is exactly the right movie at the right time.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Jonathan Bailey: We were just talking about that.",
      "Jeff Goldblum: We were just talking about that because ...",
      "JB: He lands in the opening sequence of his spinoff (laughing).",
      "JG: The Gregory Maguire books, I think there are seven of them, I think there's a lot of material that probably answers a lot of questions. I was just asking (Maguire) about what happens to Fiyero ... what is that nothingness place? I think it's described in some of those books. What are they going to do?",
      "You saw the movie? Did you get the idea that (Fiyero) is now eternal? Lives forever as a straw person? I have to see it many more times.",
      "JB: (Elphaba and Fiyero) have a family.",
      "JG: They have children ... you were saying. In the books, they have children.",
      "JB: Yes.",
      "JG: There are a bunch of books. And Frank Baum (author of \"The Wizard of Oz\") wrote a bunch of books at the beginning of the 1900s, so there's material galore.",
      "JB: I just want a film called \"Wizard\" with Jeff (laughing). But you would play every part like \"Big Momma\u2019s House.\"",
      "JG: I\u2019d like to see \"Momma\u2019s House.\" Or, I'd like to see Fiyero and Elphaba in the \"Dunescape.\"",
      "JB: We'll call it ... \"Making Hay.\" (Laughing)",
      "JG: \"Making Hay,\" excellent. (Laughing)",
      "JB: Making hay, all day and night. (Laughing)",
      "JG: I think, it's very serious. It's like \"Scenes From a Marriage,\" and we cover the next 20 years of their relationship.",
      "JB: It was all prosthetics. There\u2019s no CGI, there\u2019s no special effects. It\u2019s an extraordinary thing to be in any sort of film that celebrates the creative arts in the way that (\u201cWicked\u201d) does and I think everyone\u2019s been able to flex years of craft.",
      "It was four-and-a-half hours every morning. It was Mark (Coulier), who\u2019s an extraordinary designer, who came up with this burlap texture and it was the first conversation I had with Frances (Hannon), to think about where the literal transformation ends.",
      "There's so much that we sort of explored, the physicality, obviously with a nod to Ray Bolger (the original Scarecrow in \"The Wizard of Oz\").",
      "There's footage of a camera test which made me ... I kind of started crying because it was so reminiscent of \"The Wizard of Oz,\" and it was me and Ethan (Slater) as the Tin Man and Bethany Weaver as Dorothy.",
      "They had a chalk slate and we just walked up and down the yellow brick road and we were just exploring the characters. That was almost one of my highlights, actually.",
      "JG: I'd like to see that. There are many things about the ending that intrigue me now. What's the nothingness like? What happens to them? You know, Boq, that's very interesting and savage, his whole thing, it fascinates me. But the two ladies, our main story, wooooow!",
      "JB: The Grimmerie really comes alive.",
      "JG: And does Elphaba now not have the powers that she did with the Grimmerie? And why couldn't she have trusted (Glinda) perhaps? There's a lovely line, \"I have to be wicked so you can be good.\" Glinda is amazing, why couldn't (Elphaba) trust that, \"Hey, we're going to be OK. Don't try to contact us, etc., etc.. Don't tell anybody that we faked it.\"",
      "Or, or is the loss that Glinda experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power, her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she's ever had, really, with Elphaba? Does that trigger her ability to that power?",
      "JB: I think what's going to happen is \"Dune\" Part 3 is coming out in cinemas next year, and I think Fiyero and Elphaba are just going to walk into the shot ...",
      "JG: (Both laughing) And you'll go, \"People ... \"",
      "JB: \"Timmy?",
      "JG: \"Timothee Chalamet?\"",
      "JB: I think the answers always lie in the Grimmerie.",
      "I do think it's particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive and for someone \u2014 Ariana (Grande) charts so brilliantly \u2014 is that the absolute knowledge that (Glinda) has no magic and she no power. To see the Grimmerie come alive, feels to me, like a transference and a conversation between the two women.",
      "JG: Certainly, Elphaba telepathically kind of does that as they commune with each other across the space.",
      "Does Glinda? ... Good question. Does Glinda go, \"I don't think I did that. Are you out there somewhere?\" Maybe it's meant to be ambiguous. Ask Jon M. Chu this question because every moment means something and he, I'm sure, intends and has excavated all the logic behind all of that.",
      "JB: As we know with grief, as well, is that these people do always exist in a different form, don't they? So, in a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together.",
      "JG: Yes, you've changed me for good, meaning both those things, of course, forever.",
      "JB: There's so much hope and optimism in this story and that lies with seeing other sides and being curious about other perspectives. And what a time to be celebrating that idea.",
      "JG: Empathy. Empathy. A valuable commodity, now more than ever. If this movie isn't a machinery for the spread of empathy, I don't know what is.",
      "JB: And it just takes one person. It can be one act of kindness. It can have a ripple effect and one intentional act of radicalism that can inspire and shift.",
      "JG: The pebble in the lake and the spreading rings."

    "link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/michelle-yeoh-madame-morrible-wicked-for-good-rcna244379",
    "published": "Sat, 22 Nov 2025 20:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Oscar-winning actor, Michelle Yeoh, talks \"Wicked: For Good,\" what it took to transform into Madame Morrible and the \"sisterhood\" she shares with her co-stars.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "According to Michelle Yeoh, the real witches in \"Wicked\" aren't the ones you immediately think of. And she'd know, because she's one of them.",
      "\"There were only two witches in the Land of Oz,\" Yeoh tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. \"It was Madame Morrible and Elphaba.\"",
      "That may come as a surprise to fans of the \"Wizard of Oz\" who think that when it comes to \"Wicked's\" witches, that distinction belongs to the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), and Glinda the Good Witch (Ariana Grande).",
      "But to know the musical is to remember that the only two people with any sort of magical ability in Oz are, in fact, Elphaba and Morrible, not Glinda and definitely not The Wizard.",
      "That's why Yeoh says her character, Madame Morrible, initially aligns herself with Elphaba, before ultimately becoming her biggest adversary.",
      "\"She didn't have quite the gift and talent as Elphaba did. But at that moment, she thought, 'I found my muse. I couldn't do it, but now I have someone who can help me get to where I think it's for the goodness of Oz,'\" explains Yeoh of Madame Morrible's less-than-honorable intentions for the young sorcerer.",
      "If that's not enough to convince you that Morrible is the true wicked witch of the story, consider her initials: \"MM.\" Turn them upside down and what have you got? \"WW,\" which stands for \u2014 you guessed it \u2014\u00a0Wicked Witch.",
      "Without revealing too much, it's safe to say that Madame Morrible gets the ending she deserves in \"Wicked: For Good.\" Even so, it's hard not to wonder if, in spite of her malicious intent, there's anything redeeming about the character.",
      "\"I think the lesson to be learned here is don't get corrupted by your own desires and ambition,\" says Yeoh. \"Because (Madame Morrible) forgot about compassion and kindness, which is something she had right at the beginning. And then she got lost in her own tempest.\"",
      "Bringing the 'Scary' to Madame Morrible",
      "Fresh off the heels of her Oscar win for \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" in 2023, Yeoh stepped into the shoes of the \"Wicked\" character. To portray Madame Morrible, Yeoh says she drew on past experience to give Shiz\u2019s imposing headmistress her commanding presence.",
      "\"I think everything that I've done, especially in the physicality of my life, whether ... from ballet, to contemporary dance, to sports, to diving, to all these kind of things, helped me focus the stillness rather than the chaotic movement.\"",
      "Instead of playing Morrible as an over-the-top villain, Yeoh says she took a more subtle approach and worked at curating Morrible's icy but alluring appeal.",
      "\"This is how she would command respect and awe. It's like, how does she charm them? She draws them in,\" explains Yeoh. \"That's the most scary of all \u2014 when they're charming and personable and they listen to you and it seems like you're the only one in her world.\"",
      "\"With Madame Morrible, this was an art form that she needed to have to have that gravitas,\" she continues.",
      "Morrible's high-collared costumes and elaborate up-dos also contributed to her intimidating stature, Yeoh says.",
      "\"It was the combination of everything that helped me build Madame Morrible to when she walks out, you go back and go, 'Alright, not going to mess with you!'\"",
      "It's not the first time Yeoh has used her inner stillness to bring a character to life. She says she also channeled it for her work in  \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" and the hit 2018 rom-com, \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" which was also directed by Jon M. Chu.",
      "\"The mother, Mrs. Eleanor Young, is also a very commanding figure without being loud, she never raises her voice, but when she speaks with her tone, every gesture is measured with intention. It's not frivolous. It's nothing like that,\" Yeoh says.",
      "\"So, when she stops to look at you, you go, \"Okayyyy,\" she adds.",
      "Forging a Sisterhood",
      "Based on the 1995 Gregory Maguire book, \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,\" bringing the films \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good\" to the big screen has been a decades-long endeavor that began back in the early 2000s.",
      "Yeoh joined the cast in 2022 and filmed the original and sequel simultaneously along with the rest of the cast, including Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo.",
      "\"You will miss (them), because at the end of the day, you've built up such a great bond and it's a family,\" says Yeoh, who explains that while goodbyes can be hard, they're also an inevitable part of the business.",
      "\"This is how it is, but the good news is if you really bonded, they'll always be there. I'm still in touch with Jamie Lee Curtis, and it's been so many years. And 'Crazy Rich Asians,' we still have a group chat,\" she says.",
      "As for Grande and Erivo, Yeoh says that even though the films are done, what she takes away from her co-stars is a lasting sisterhood.",
      "\"We champion each other. We believe in each other. We support each other. No questions asked, let's just go forward, up and above, let's just do it together,\" Yeoh says.",
      "\"And when we're not with each other, we don't forget that will always have the bond.\""

      "But Nessa, who has stripped munchkins of their right to travel in order to keep her love, Boq (Ethan Slater), by her side, is consumed by resentment. She yells at Elphaba for trying to help animals instead of her. As a result, Elphaba opens her Grimmerie and casts a spell on Nessarose, giving her the ability to fly.",
      "Fans of the stage musical remember that in this scene, Elphaba\u2019s spell gives Nessarose, who uses a wheelchair, the ability to walk.",
      "Marissa Bode is the first actor to play Nessarose and use a wheelchair off-screen. She previously told TODAY that the change from walking to flying in \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d represents \u201cless of a case of my character wanting to be fixed, and more of her just taking in the magic itself.\u201d",
      "Glinda Performs \u2018Wonderful\u2019 With the Wizard",
      "After trying to get her sister\u2019s support, Elphaba goes directly to the Emerald City to try and take on the Wizard.",
      "There, he again tries to get her to join forces with him via a song called \u201cWonderful.\u201d",
      "But in the film, Glinda joins the pair for the song. \u201cWonderful\u201d becomes a duet between Glinda and the Wizard as they both try to convince Elphaba to return to the public\u2019s good graces.",
      "Glinda and Fiyero Almost Get Married",
      "In the stage musical, Glinda and Fiyero are engaged before he ultimately abandons her to run off with Elphaba. In \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d they almost made it down the aisle.",
      "When Elphaba goes to the Emerald City, it turns out to be on Glinda and Fiyero\u2019s wedding day.",
      "After Elphaba\u2019s almost been convinced to join Glinda and the Wizard through their rendition of \u201cWonderful,\u201d she asks the Wizard to free the flying monkeys she accidentally created in Part 1. He complies \u2014 but then she uncovers a secret crevice where the Wizard had kept in cages dozens of animals, including Elphaba\u2019s former professor Dr. Dillamond, preventing them from speaking. Outraged, Elphaba frees all the animals, interrupting Glinda as she walks down the aisle.",
      "\u201cWe wanted the stakes to be higher,\u201d Chu says of the change. \u201cWe wanted to make this sort of intercut parallel between her getting married and (Elphaba\u2019s) reality of finding these animals in cages. The fact that these two, dream and nightmare, could collide at this intersection was really important to break the story.\u201d",
      "When Fiyero, who\u2019s captain of the guard, later finds Elphaba, he decides to escape with her, breaking Glinda\u2019s heart.",
      "Viewers See Dorothy \u2014 But Never Her Face",
      "\u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and its characters are intertwined with \u201cWicked\u2019s\u201d story. For example, Boq and Fiyero famously become the Tin Man and the Scarecrow, while the cub that Fiyero and Elphaba rescue as students grows up to be the Cowardly Lion. But what about Dorothy?",
      "In the stage musical, Dorothy is merely seen as a shadow throwing water on Elphaba in the film\u2019s finale. But \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d cast Bethany Weaver to play the part.",
      "Throughout the film, viewers can see Dorothy, her brunette pigtails and her blue plaid dress, but only from the back. Her face is never seen.",
      "That decision was easy, says Chu.",
      "\u201cThere was a mantra that we were taught when we first started this from the people who did the stage show, and they said, \u2018The key is it\u2019s about the girls, stupid.\u2019 ... That has guided our way the whole time,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to Dorothy and all these other characters, those are really fun things, but in movie language, if you see her face, you\u2019re going to want to know who she is, where she comes from, what does she want \u2014 and then the story takes a way left turn,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd this is \u2018about the girls, stupid.\u2019\u201d",
      "Glinda Formally Takes Over as a Leader of Oz",
      "After witnessing Fiyero\u2019s capture and Madame Morrible\u2019s cruelty, Glinda weighs whether to do something or stay complacent in the film\u2019s second brand new song, \u201cGirl in the Bubble.\u201d",
      "\u201cPart of deconstructing the fairy tale \u2014 which is sort of the point of \u2018Wicked,\u2019 to see this American fairytale in a new way, through a new perspective \u2014 part of that was understanding not just what what Elphaba was going through, but also what it means for somebody in a bubble of privilege when the truth is coming out,\u201d Chu says.",
      "\u201cAt what point does someone who doesn\u2019t have to be affected by this, what kind of courage does it take to actually pop your own bubble and engage and help somebody else? I think that that\u2019s such an important lesson in these days, that courage \u2014 no matter where you missed the moment \u2014 courage has no expiration date, and that we still have time to be the people who we see ourselves as,\u201d he adds.",
      "She ultimately chooses to go to Elphaba\u2019s side. The best friends briefly reconcile with \u201cFor Good\u201d before Elphaba fakes her own death. After escaping, Glinda returns to the Emerald City, forces the departure of the Wizard, arrests Madame Morrible and takes over as a leader of Oz.",
      "And in a slight expansion from the musical, we see exactly what she does with that newfound power: Free the animals.",
      "The Grimmerie Opens for Glinda",
      "Finally, the very end of \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d introduces a scene that is meant to spark discourse. As Elphaba and Fiyero escape to the Lands Beyond Oz, Glinda looks out over the Emerald City. The magic book, the Grimmerie, which Elphaba entrusted to her before her \u201cdeath,\u201d suddenly comes alive and opens beside Glinda.",
      "There are theories about what the Grimmerie\u2019s opening means, even among the cast and crew. Some think it represents Glinda finally having the potential to be a true witch, while others say it\u2019s a message from Elphaba to Glinda.",
      "\u201cWhat I think is great about this book of knowledge, the Grimmerie, I mean, it can be interpreted as many things,\u201d Chu says."

In \"No Place Like Home,\" Elphaba tries to get the animals to change their minds about fleeing Oz.

Glinda escapes on horseback, shrouded in a black cape. (Yes, Glinda was the mysterious figure we saw escaping a castle in the very first scene of the first \u201cWicked\u201d movie.) She goes on to assume power in Oz as she mourns her best friend\u2019s death.",
      "Only Elphaba isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s hiding in a trapdoor, waiting for her beloved Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) to meet her before they leave for the Land Beyond Oz together.",
      "From there, viewers get a bit of a twist before the movie concludes. Here\u2019s what happens.",
      "How \u2018Wicked: For Good\u2019 Ends",
      "The stage version of \u201cWicked\u201d ends with Elphaba and Fiyero leaving Oz, and Glinda stepping into a position of power.",
      "But in \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d viewers see what happens to Glinda after she becomes Oz\u2019s leader. First, she officially declares the land welcome to all animals again.",
      "In the final scene, Glinda looks over the Emerald City as Elphaba and Fiyero trek through a desert to leave Oz. Elphaba looks back for a brief moment. Then Elphaba\u2019s book of spells, the Grimmerie, flutters to life before Glinda\u2019s eyes. Elphaba had given the book to Glinda before Elphaba\u2019s encounter with Dorothy.",
      "As established in the first film, the Grimmerie only opens for and can be read by a true witch, something that, as much as she tried \u2014  whether through begging Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) for sorcery lessons or twirling her practice wand \u2014 Glinda decidedly was not.",
      "So what does the Grimmerie opening mean?",
      "We asked the team behind \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d for their takes on the final scene. See what director Jon M. Chu and stars Cynthia Erivo, Jeff Goldblum and Jonathan Bailey had to say.",
      "How \u2018Wicked: For Good\u2019 Stars Interpret the Ending",
      "Chu declines to say \u201cexactly what (the ending) is\u201d by his intention.",
      "But he points to all the different interpretations of what the Grimmerie, \u201ca book of knowledge,\u201d could be, relative to both Glinda and Elphaba.",
      "\u201cWhether (Glinda) finally gets to be who she\u2019s meant to be, that she\u2019s not reliant on this image in this mirror,\u201d Chu says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be good.\u2019 She says, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to be good.\u2019",
      "\u201cJust the effort of trying to be who we\u2019re supposed to be opens and unlocks our unlimited possibilities,\u201d he adds.",
      "The spontaneous opening of the Grimmerie could also relate to the film\u2019s theme of pursuing the truth amid propaganda. By the end of the film, Elphaba\u2019s reputation as the Wicked Witch of the West as told in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is upended by political lies told by the nonmagical Wizard of Oz and, as actor Michelle Yeoh says, the true wicked witch, Madame Morrible. But while viewers know the truth, in the world of the movie, Ozians do not, after Elphaba tells Glinda not to clear her name.",
      "\u201cIt could also be, Cynthia could be Jesus giving us, the humans, this Bible and saying, you know the truth, now what are you going to do with it?\u201d Chu says.",
      "\u201cI think it is a challenge to us as the audience, whereas maybe movie one was more of an answer. This is more a question and challenge for us to see how we\u2019re going to tell our story to the next generation,\u201d he adds.",
      "Erivo says Elphaba leaving the Grimmerie behind represents her entrusting it to Glinda.",
      "\u201cI think Elphaba\u2019s powers exist independent of the Grimmerie, and because she has certain powers, she\u2019s able to read the Grimmerie. It\u2019s like she and Grimmerie have an intrinsic relationship, and so the Grimmerie answers to her,\u201d she explains.",
      "\u201cBut her leaving it behind and trusting it to Glinda essentially tells the Grimmerie, \u2018You\u2019re in new hands, trust this person,\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t mean Elphaba\u2019s lost her connection with the book. She says she believes Elphaba in fact can see the Grimmerie opening for Glinda.",
      "\u201cShe has visions, so I think she can see what happens, and she can feel it. And it opening means to her that, one, Glinda\u2019s made the right decision, and two, the Grimmerie trusts Glinda now, so everything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she says.",
      "But does Glinda know Elphaba is watching over her?",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba has something to do with it (opening), but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba\u2019s alive,\u201d Erivo says.",
      "As for Goldblum, who stars as the Wizard of Oz, he is curious what leaving the Grimmerie behind means for Elphaba\u2019s powers. He also wonders: Why couldn\u2019t Elphaba trust Glinda with the knowledge that they survived?",
      "\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t she trust that, \u2018Hey we\u2019re going to be OK, don\u2019t try to contact us ... Don\u2019t tell anybody that we faked it.\u2019 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Goldblum says. \u201cOr, is the loss that (Glinda) experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power. Her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she\u2019s ever had with Elphaba, does that trigger her ability to power?\u201d",
      "As for the opening of the Grimmerie, Goldblum says it\u2019s possible for Elphaba to \u201ctelepathically\u201d \u201ccommune\u201d with Glinda across space.",

      "Like Goldblum, Bailey believes there\u2019s a chance the opening of the Grimmerie was Elphaba sending Glinda a message.",
      "\u201cI think that the answers always lie in the Grimmerie, and I do think it\u2019s particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive for someone ... (with) the absolute knowledge that she has no magic and that she has no power,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cTo see the Grimmerie come alive feels to me like a transference and a conversation between the two women.\u201d",
      "He believes this, even if it\u2019s not so literal of a conversation or message.",
      "\u201cAs we know with grief as well, those people do always exist in a different form, don\u2019t they? In a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together,\u201d he adds.",
      "Holzman, who wrote the book for \u201cWicked\u201d and co-wrote the screenplays for both films with writer Dana Fox, says the goal for the ending was to create a \u201cmystical moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith something mystical, it\u2019s not like the whole point is you know the answer, it\u2019s that it pulls something out of you, like a spiritual feeling,\u201d she says.",
      "One interpretation of the Grimmerie opening, Holzman says, has to do with the evolution of Glinda\u2019s character.",
      "\u201cShe was willing to let go ... of all the need to be admired in this empty way. And she was willing to be humble, to be a student, to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know everything,\u2019\u201d Holzman says.",
      "Fox adds that the moment Glinda \u201cearns\u201d the Grimmerie opening is when she admits her \u201cdeepest shame\u201d to Elphaba: that she can\u2019t read the Grimmerie and perform spells.",
      "\u201cShe wanted so much to be that magical creature who could make magic happen, and she\u2019s going to end up being that, but it\u2019s going to take hard work,\u201d Holzman says. \u201cAnd to me, the Grimmerie opening is like the Grimmerie saying, \u2018OK, you\u2019re ready.\u2019\u201d",
      "But the question remains: Does Elphaba know?",
      "\u201cI think the thing that really is up to interpretation that everyone should just talk about amongst themselves is, Does Elphaba know? Did she have anything to do with it? I think that is something that just everyone should decide for themselves,\u201d Fox says."

    "story": [
      "The Kremlin said Wednesday that the leak of a phone call between senior U.S. and Russian officials was intended to disrupt peace talks, and warned it was premature to say that a deal to end its war in Ukraine was close.",
      "President Donald Trump, whose envoy Steve Witkoff will visit Moscow next week, said that his peace plan had been \"fine-tuned\" and that he had no deadline for an agreement after earlier pressuring Kyiv to endorse a proposal by Thanksgiving.",
      "Kyiv and its allies indicated they were broadly happy with changes to the plan, though key sticking points remained. As attention shifted to Russia, which has held to its maximalist demands, the leak added to questions about the Kremlin's role in negotiations.",
      "Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested the leak of his conversation with Witkoff was an attempt to interfere in the peace talks. \u201cIt is unlikely that this is done to improve relations,\u201d he said.",
      "Witkoff advised his Russian counterpart on how to best appeal to Trump about a peace plan and suggested setting up a call with Putin prior to a White House visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to a transcript of the Oct. 14 call published by Bloomberg News. Bloomberg said it had reviewed a recording of the call but did not say how it obtained access to it.",
      "Ushakov said Wednesday that he talks to Witkoff regularly, but does not comment on the content of those conversations. \u201cSomeone is leaking, someone is listening, but not us,\u201d he said when asked about the story.",
      "In later comments, Ushakov said \"some of these leaks are fake,\u201d adding that his conversations with Witkoff were confidential and that leaking them to the media was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d He said he would discuss the leaks directly on a call with the U.S. envoy.",
      "In an interview with Russia's Kommersant newspaper, Ushakov said he makes some calls via WhatsApp, which \"someone, apparently, can somehow eavesdrop on.\"",
      "Trump dismissed the controversy, describing Witkoff's reported approach on the call as \u201ca very standard form of negotiation\u201d and \"what a dealmaker does.\"",
      "White House communications director Steven Cheung also said on X that there was \"nothing wrong\" with what was said in the \"supposed\" transcript. \"In fact, it shows what a successful negotiator does in order to get a deal done,\" Cheung said.",
      "But the leak added fuel to criticism that Witkoff, and the original peace plan itself, were too favorable to the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cOutrageous on many levels. He [Witkoff] intentionally sabotaged the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting by pushing the Russians to call the day before. And he is hopelessly naive to think that Putin really wants to end the war,\u201d said William Taylor, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.",
      "Bloomberg also published a transcript of an Oct. 29 call between Ushakov and Kirill Dmitriev, a close Putin adviser who has emerged as a prominent figure in talks. \u201cI\u2019ll informally pass it along, making it clear that it\u2019s all informal. And let them do like their own,\u201d Dmitriev suggests. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll take exactly our version, but at least it\u2019ll be as close to it as possible,\u201d he said, according to the transcript.",
      "Dmitriev posted \u201cFake\u201d on X, adding that \u201cthe closer we get to peace the more desperate warmongers become.\u201d",
      "Ushakov did not deny the existence of the call with Dmitriev.",
      "The original 28-point peace plan leaked last week appeared to favor Moscow heavily, forcing Ukraine to cede territory, including areas its army currently controls. It also envisioned a reduction to Ukraine\u2019s military and a ban on Kyiv joining NATO.",
      "The U.S. has insisted it authored the plan, after allies and lawmakers expressed concerns over its origins.",
      "Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One late Tuesday, Trump said his plan was \u201ca concept\u201d and \u201can original proposal,\u201d from which negotiators went \u201cback and forth.\u201d",
      "Trump said his son-in-law Jared Kushner may join Witkoff in Moscow, having earlier announced that Army Secretary Dan Driscoll would meet with Ukrainian officials for further talks.",
      "Asked whether Thanksgiving was no longer any sort of deadline, Trump responded: \u201cYou know what the deadline for me is? When it\u2019s over. And I think everybody is tired of fighting at this point.\u201d",
      "Ushakov said Wednesday that Russia had received several versions of the peace plan, which he said can be \u201cconfusing.\u201d",
      "He said some aspects of it could be viewed \u201cpositively,\u201d but added that the situation was \u201cevolving rapidly.\u201d",
      "Asked whether Russia was closer to peace with Ukraine than ever before, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, \"It's premature to say so.\"",
      "Kyiv appeared confident Tuesday that it could finalize a deal with Trump by the end of the month, saying it was looking forward to organizing a Trump-Zelenskyy meeting in the United States.",
      "But Trump appeared to shoot that down, saying he would only meet with the two leaders once a deal was in its final stages."

      "Both China and Japan said Trump initiated the calls, which the White House has not confirmed.",
      "The dispute began when Takaichi, who was elected last month, told lawmakers that a hypothetical Chinese attack on self-ruling Taiwan, which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory, could threaten Japan\u2019s survival and trigger a military response from Tokyo.",
      "It was the first time such an explicit remark had been made by a sitting prime minister of Japan, which like the United States has long been deliberately vague as to whether it would intervene militarily in the event of an attack on Taiwan.",
      "China, which describes Taiwan as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d has responded with outrage, taking the dispute to the United Nations, advising its citizens against traveling to Japan and seeking economic retaliation against Japanese seafood, movies, concerts and more.",
      "On Monday, China criticized Japan\u2019s plan to deploy missiles on an island near Taiwan as a deliberate attempt to \u201ccreate regional tension and provoke military confrontation,\u201d while Japan scrambled a fighter jet after it detected a Chinese drone flying between Taiwan and the Japanese island of Yonaguni.",
      "Though Takaichi has refused Beijing\u2019s demands that she retract her \u201cerroneous\u201d remarks, her government says Japan\u2019s policy on Taiwan has not changed and it continues to favor a peaceful resolution to the issue.",
      "Trump has not publicly commented on the dispute, though his ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has said Tokyo can count on U.S. support in the face of Chinese \u201ccoercion.\u201d",
      "Takaichi said Tuesday that she reaffirmed Japan\u2019s close cooperation with the U.S. in her call with Trump, which she said he initiated.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump mentioned that he and I are extremely good friends, and that I should call him any time,\u201d she told reporters, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during a visit to Japan last month, which was followed by a meeting with Xi in South Korea to address tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies over trade and other issues.",
      "Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d call with Xi, their first since that meeting, and that U.S.-China relations were \u201cextremely strong.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cNow we can set our sights on the big picture.\u201d",
      "Trump reaffirmed plans announced last month for him to visit Beijing in April, followed by a U.S. visit by Xi later in the year. He said he and Xi discussed Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and the illicit international flow of fentanyl ingredients. Taiwan was not mentioned in Trump\u2019s post.",
      "That is good news for Taiwan amid growing pressure from China and questions about Trump\u2019s commitment to its security, suggesting that \u201cfrom the U.S.\u2019 perspective, there is nothing about Taiwan that has changed,\u201d said Lev Nachman, a professor of political science at National Taiwan University.",
      "Xi also said the U.S. and China had \u201cgenerally maintained a steady and positive trajectory,\u201d according to a readout of the call published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the call was initiated by the U.S. side.",
      "Unlike Trump\u2019s post, the Chinese readout of the call heavily emphasized Taiwan, whose \u201creturn to China\u201d Xi said was an important part of the post-World War II international order.",
      "Taiwan, a former Japanese colony, was handed to the Republic of China government after Japan\u2019s defeat in 1945, only for that government to retreat to Taiwan a few years later after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong\u2019s communist forces. The island has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Taiwan Premier Cho Jung-tai said Tuesday that for the 23 million people of Taiwan, there was \u201cno option of returning\u201d to China.",
      "\u201cWe must once again emphasize that the Republic of China is a fully sovereign and independent nation,\u201d he told reporters in Taipei, using Taiwan\u2019s formal name.",

      "Taiwan has not been a major focus of U.S.-China relations in recent months, with Trump saying it \u201cnever came up\u201d during his meeting with Xi. The Chinese readout of their Oct. 30 meeting also failed to mention Taiwan, which is unusual.",
      "The Trump-Xi call comes after the U.S. announced two arms sales to Taiwan in the space of a week, the first since Trump returned to office in January. They include an advanced missile system worth almost $700 million and $330 million in fighter jet and other aircraft parts.",
      "China objects to such sales by the U.S., which has no official relations with Taiwan but is legally bound to provide the island with weapons for its defense.",

      "As representatives from nearly 200 nations were wrapping up talks at the United Nations\u2019 COP30 climate summit this week, the United States was not only absent, but the Trump administration also introduced a series of sweeping proposals to roll back environmental protections and encourage fossil fuel drilling.",
      "The United Nations Climate Change Conference ended Friday in the Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m, where delegates gathered to hammer out a road map to phase out fossil fuels, boost climate action and limit global warming.",
      "For the first time in the summit\u2019s history, the U.S. \u2014 one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases \u2014 did not send a delegation. Instead, the Trump administration this week announced a plan to open up new oil drilling off the coasts of California and Florida for the first time in decades and proposed rule changes to weaken the Endangered Species Act and limit the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority to protect wetlands and streams.",
      "\u201cThese rules double down on the administration\u2019s refusal to confront the climate crisis in a serious way and, in fact, move us in the opposite direction,\u201d said Jessie Ritter, associate vice president of waters and coasts for the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation group.",
      "The White House told NBC News on Friday that this week\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d announcements aim to \u201cfurther President Trump\u2019s American energy dominance agenda.\u201d",

      "Ritter said the new proposals signal to the world just how much the U.S. has stepped back from any meaningful climate action.",
      "\u201cI doubt that this surprises folks who have been watching in the international arena,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s unfortunate, given the example the U.S. sets and what our leadership, or lack thereof, emboldens other countries to do.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's announcement on Thursday that it intends to open up roughly 1.27 billion acres of coastal U.S. waters for oil drilling drew bipartisan pushback.",
      "Although the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, hailed the program as a \u201chistoric step toward unleashing our nation\u2019s vast offshore resources,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., pushed to uphold the current moratorium on drilling, which Trump extended during his first term.",
      "\u201cI have been speaking to @SecretaryBurgum and made my expectations clear that this moratorium must remain in place, and that in any plan, Florida\u2019s coasts must remain off the table for oil drilling to protect Florida\u2019s tourism, environment, and military training opportunities,\u201d Scott wrote Thursday on X, referring to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.",
      "Across the country, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on X that \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s idiotic proposal to sell off California\u2019s coasts to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by as our coastal economy and communities are put in danger,\u201d he said.",
      "The drilling directive came just three days after the Trump administration proposed major limits to the Clean Water Act of 1972 that would undo protections from pollution and runoff for most of the country\u2019s small streams and wetlands. The rule would narrow the definition of which bodies qualify as \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d under the act.",
      "If finalized, the changes would mean that the smallest share of freshwater resources would be under federal protection since the law was enacted, according to Jon Devine, who heads the water policy team at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.",
      "\u201cBy EPA\u2019s own estimate, only about 19% of the country\u2019s wetlands would be protected against unregulated destruction and development if this were finalized,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands act as buffers against flooding by absorbing and storing water during extreme rainfall and other high-runoff events. As the world warms, coastal and inland flooding is expected to become more frequent and severe.",
      "\u201cMany of the places that we already have in the U.S. that are increasingly flood-prone due to climate change are going to be even more in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands and streams also feed into other bodies of water that serve as critical drinking water supplies across the country, so critics fear the policy could make drinking water unsafe in some communities.",
      "The third major environmental rollback announced this week was a set of four rules that would erode protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The proposed changes aim to make it easier to remove species classified as threatened or endangered and harder to add new protected species and their habitats to the list. The rules, if passed, would also allow the government to consider \u201ceconomic impacts\u201d in decisions to list or delist species.",
      "Taken together, Ritter said, these three proposals are consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory agenda.",
      "\u201cThese decisions prioritize short-term gain, often for a few industries and special interests, at the expense of things that have been widely bipartisan and important issues for people for decades,\u201d Ritter said.",
      "The impacts of the changes might not all be apparent right away, she added, but the scale of the long-term consequences could be immense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s truly not an exaggeration that this is going to touch all Americans in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is connected, and it\u2019s hubris to think that we can have these massive negative effects on our streams and wetlands, our animals, our coastal waters, without impacts to humans.\u201d"

      "Dozens of young people wave their phone flashlights and sing along with a teen as she belts out lyrics and plays her keyboard outside a subway station.",
      "It\u2019s a scene that regularly plays out in cities around the world. But the singer in this widely shared video is now behind bars.",
      "Diana Loginova, the 18-year-old student and street musician, has emerged as an unlikely \u2014 and perhaps unwilling \u2014 voice of defiance in wartime Russia.",
      "Known by her stage name Naoko, the teen gained popularity over the summer with viral videos taken around St. Petersburg of her band Stoptime performing songs by musicians who have spoken out against Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine. Inevitably, in a country where nearly all forms of dissent have been crushed, Russian authorities quickly took notice.",
      "Naoko was first detained last month for organizing a \u201cmass simultaneous gathering of citizens\u201d during a performance, which authorities said disrupted public order, and was sentenced to 13 days behind bars. She has since been rearrested twice on the same charges, as well as for petty hooliganism, and put back in prison. Her fellow band members have also served back-to-back sentences, although one has since been released.",
      "\u201cWhat is happening is what we call carousel arrests,\u201d Dmitrii Anisimov, a human rights activist and spokesperson for the OVD-Info protest monitoring group, told NBC News. \u201cTheoretically, it can continue forever,\u201d he said. In practice, it could mean months in detention, and there is legal precedent for this, he added.",
      "\u201cIt looks like Russian authorities want to use the persecution of Naoko, as with many other public cases, to intimidate others,\u201d said Anisimov.",
      "Loginova\u2019s lawyer, Maria Zyryanova, told NBC News she wouldn\u2019t discuss the case while the singer is behind bars. Her current sentence expires Sunday.",
      "Naoko\u2019s case has been extensively covered by Russian state news agencies and exiled independent media, while supporters have spread leaflets calling for her freedom.",
      "In an interview published in August, months before her imprisonment, Naoko said she was \u201cscared\u201d to be detained but felt she \u201chad to do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI understand that art is now the only language \u2014 at least in Russia \u2014 through which you can express your thoughts. I\u2019ve chosen it and don\u2019t want to speak any other,\u201d she told St. Petersburg news outlet Bumaga.",
      "Others have taken up that language in Loginova\u2019s absence.",
      "On a bench near the Kiyevskaya metro station in central Moscow, musician Vasily told NBC News that Naoko\u2019s case had \u201clit a fire\u201d in him, inspiring his own street performances as a way to support the jailed singer.",
      "\u201cHer freedom was taken away for her singing,\u201d said Vasily, whose last name NBC News chose not to reveal for his safety. \u201cThat got me mad.\u201d",
      "Valentina, a professional musician from the city of Yaroslavl, about 380 miles southeast of St. Petersburg, has been singing on both the streets and social media in support of Naoko.",
      "Inspired after seeing Naoko\u2019s performances on TikTok, she has been posting videos where she performs the same songs. One gained more than 600,000 views on Instagram, which scared her because she did not want to get on authorities\u2019 radar, said Valentina, who did not want her last name revealed for fear of repercussions. \u201cWhen I saw the news about Naoko, it felt like my last hope was taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not feel sorry for myself. I just really wanted to help. I thought, \u2018Why do I berate people who keep silent and don\u2019t say anything in our country when I am also remaining silent and scared?\u2019\u201d",
      "Loginova is still a child, noted Vasily \u2014 himself only 19. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s touched people, that this little girl is not afraid to get on the streets and sing the songs of foreign agents.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s referencing the status of exiled singer Monetochka and rapper Noize MC, both slapped with the official designation often reserved for public figures whose views have set them at odds with the Kremlin.",
      "It was a song by Noize MC, who has openly spoken out against the war and Putin\u2019s regime, that Loginova performed before she first landed in jail.",
      "The rapper\u2019s lyrics that appear to have gotten her in the most trouble appear innocuous on the surface: \u201cI want to watch a ballet, let the swans dance.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a reference to the failed 1991 coup attempt against the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, during which state TV showed the \u201cSwan Lake\u201d ballet on a continuous loop. It has since come to symbolize something dangerous in Putin\u2019s Russia \u2014 change.",
      "A video of the band\u2019s cover of the song, which Loginova has said they performed rarely and not for the cameras, drew the ire of war supporters who questioned why the band was allowed to perform the songs of \u201ctraitors\u201d and whether their performances were, in fact, concealed protests.",
      "A representative for Noize MC said in an email that the rapper \u201cprefers not to give interviews or public comments regarding this case \u2014 primarily to avoid any risk of unintentionally affecting those directly involved.\u201d",
      "Monetochka, whose songs the band also performed, hailed them as \u201cheroes\u201d in a statement on social media, saying that Loginova was bringing \u201cmusic and freedom\u201d into the world rather than \u201cviolence and war.\u201d She did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov for comment on the case.",
      "Kremlin critic Boris Nadezhdin, who was barred from running against Putin in last year\u2019s election, said he had been in communication with Loginova\u2019s mom, Irina, and was fundraising to cover the band\u2019s legal costs.",
      "He has also been raising awareness on social media and said people\u2019s emotional reactions were palpable. \u201cShe is young, she is a female, and she is not at all a politician or journalist. People are used to repressions against opposition politicians and journalists, but this is a new low,\u201d said Nadezhdin.",
      "The people who came to listen to the band were also young, he added, a red flag for the Kremlin because of its predominantly older support base. \u201cSo they need to have an exemplary reprisal against some young singer,\u201d he said, \u201cso that others get fearful.\u201d",
      "While she garners sympathy at home and abroad, Loginova remains behind bars for her singing. Nadezhdin said he was not optimistic about her chances of performing again anytime soon.",
      "\u201cThey won\u2019t leave her alone quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cI am telling them to get ready for a long ride ahead.\u201d"

      "Ukraine and its allies welcomed progress Monday after high-stakes talks with the United States over the plan to end Russia\u2019s war, which Washington has pressured Kyiv to endorse by Thanksgiving.",
      "Meetings in Geneva produced an \u201cupdated and refined peace framework,\u201d Ukraine and the U.S. said in a joint statement that described \"meaningful progress\" from the \"highly productive\" talks.",
      "No specific details were released. European leaders expressed optimism but cautioned that \"major issues\" remained as Kyiv and its allies sought to navigate the U.S. ultimatum to accept the 28-point proposal they view as handing the Kremlin its key demands.",
      "Moscow continued to suggest it had been shut out of the discussions, and it was unclear whether any counterproposals from Ukraine would be acceptable to Russia.",
      "President Donald Trump also weighed in. \"Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don\u2019t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,\" he said in a post on Truth Social early Monday.",
      "The Ukrainian delegation was on its way home to report back on the progress made, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. \u201cBased on these reports, we will determine the next steps and the timing,\u201d he added.",
      "Speaking earlier by video link at a summit in Sweden, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv was working with partners \"to look for compromises that strengthen but not weaken us.\"",
      "He had warned Friday that his country faced perhaps its most difficult week yet, confronting the choice between its \u201cdignity\u201d and a \u201ckey partner.\u201d",
      "Trump injected greater tension as talks took place in Switzerland, accusing Kyiv of expressing \u201czero gratitude\u201d to the U.S. for its support throughout the conflict.",
      "Yet, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that \u201ca tremendous amount of progress\u201d had been made after the talks with Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy, attempting the balancing act of appeasing Trump and ensuring his nation's sovereignty while under fire at home for a corruption scandal, said that \u201cUkraine was grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and to President Trump personally.\u201d",
      "In a separate statement, Zelenskyy said there were \u201csignals President Trump\u2019s team is hearing us.\u201d",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that there are no plans for Zelenskyy to come to the White House \u201cat this moment in time\u201d but advised things can change quickly. She added that Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff and the team in Geneva worked through the 28-point peace plan with input from both the Russians and the Ukrainians over the weekend.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these points have been agreed upon. The Ukrainians have worked on language with us together, and you heard that from their delegation directly yesterday. So we feel as though we\u2019re in a very good place,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cOf course, we have to make sure that all of these points are agreed to. And then, of course, we\u2019re going to have to make sure the other party in this war, the Russians, agree to them, as well.\u201d",
      "But, while there were signs of progress, Europe remained wary as America's traditional allies scrambled to respond to the sudden emergence of a deal that could define the continent's security.",
      "\u201cThe negotiations were a step forward, but there are still major issues which remain to be resolved,\u201d Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on X.",
      "European Union leaders met to discuss the issue at a summit already taking place in Angola on Monday, as a counterproposal from major European powers circulated in the media.",
      "\u201cWhile work remains to be done, there is now a solid basis for moving forward,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement following the meeting.",
      "A German government spokesperson said Berlin saw the progress made in Geneva \u201cvery positively,\u201d according to Reuters.",
      "The plan backed by Trump amounts to Ukraine's effective capitulation, ceding key territories to Russia while reducing its military in return for no major concessions from Moscow.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin wants legal recognition for what he has \u201cstolen,\u201d Zelenskyy said Monday in reference to the plan\u2019s provision for the entire eastern Donbas region, as well as Crimea, annexed in 2014, to be de facto recognized as Russian. \u201cTo break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty, and that\u2019s the main problem,\u201d he added.",
      "U.S. allies and lawmakers have raised questions over who may have been behind the plan and how much Ukraine was consulted.",
      "Rubio insisted Sunday that the plan was authored by the U.S. after a bipartisan group of senators said he had told them that the text being discussed was a Russian initiative given to special envoy Witkoff.",
      "Moscow has maintained it has not officially been looped in to talks.",
      "During a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Monday, Putin said the plan, \"in the version we have reviewed,\" is consistent with discussions at his summer summit with Trump in Alaska, \"and, in principle, could form the basis for a final peace settlement,\" according to a Kremlin readout.",
      "Still, it\u2019s unclear if the Kremlin would agree to any modifications that would be necessary to get Ukraine and Europe to sign on.",
      "On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that it has not been updated on the progress of talks between Ukraine and the U.S. \u201cWe have, of course, been closely monitoring media reports that have been pouring in over the past few days, including from Geneva. But we haven\u2019t received anything official yet,\u201d he said.",

      "The pressure building on Ukraine is not just diplomatic.",
      "While President Donald Trump pushes for a quick resolution, the churning mud of the battlefield has produced only slow and painstaking gains for the Kremlin during the four years since its full-scale invasion.",
      "From the front-line city of Pokrovsk in eastern Donetsk to Zaporizhzhia in the south and the northern region of Kharkiv, there is little doubt that Russia is making advances.",
      "President Vladimir Putin has urged Ukraine to surrender key territory at the negotiating table \u2014 as Washington has suggested \u2014 or face Moscow's military taking it by force anyway. Trump has echoed this sentiment, warning that Ukraine \"will lose in a short period of time\" if it does not agree to the deal he has backed.",
      "But battlefield monitors suggest the picture is not quite so bleak for Ukraine as Trump and Putin suggest.",
      "Russia's gains are slow and incremental, won at a heavy cost against Kyiv\u2019s overstretched army, according to these mostly Western observers, who see Moscow as overstating its position for diplomatic gain in negotiations with Washington.",
      "Pokrovsk, a transit hub that has been the center of the fighting for months, could soon hand the Kremlin its first major capture in two years.",
      "Yet, Russia would not be able to take the rest of Donetsk \"without significant casualties, probably in the hundreds of thousands,\" Chris Parry, a former NATO commander and rear admiral in the British Royal Navy, told NBC News in an interview. If Ukraine gives that up in a deal, it \"will leave the rest of the country vulnerable to a strike anytime that Putin wants to come back,\" he said.",
      "Indeed, since Aug. 15, Russia has has been advancing at \"foot pace,\u201d gaining just 3\u00bd square miles a day, according to an analysis Sunday by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank.",
      "In all, Russia has occupied only an additional 1% of territory since November 2022, war-watchers agree. Most of the 20% of Ukraine that Russia controls is made up of land seized by Russian-backed fighters after 2014, and the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Assuming it can keep up even this crawl, Russia would not capture the rest of Donetsk until at least August 2027 \u201cand likely even longer,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War said. And Putin is pressuring Ukraine to hand over this territory, not because it truly is a fait accompli, but merely \u201cto save Russia significant amounts of time, effort, manpower, and resources,\" it said.",
      "On the flip side, not even Ukraine's most ardent supporters could claim that its position is easy. Could it survive the Russian advance if it wasn\u2019t coming under U.S. pressure to capitulate?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d said Michael A. Horowitz, a Jerusalem-based geopolitical consultant. \u201cWe\u2019re in a battle of attrition, and both sides are paying a very high cost to defend or capture smaller and smaller areas.\u201d",
      "Pokrovsk is \u201con the verge of falling into Russian hands,\u201d said Horowitz, who follows the conflict in minutiae.",
      "That would allow Russian troops to turn their attention north to the \u201cfortress belt\u201d of Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk, Slovyansk and Kostyantynivka, a defensive line of cities that Kyiv has spent years reinforcing.",
      "Giving Donetsk to Russia would hand over these cities anyway.",
      "Ultimately, few Ukrainians believe this would be the end of the Kremlin\u2019s aggression. Rather, it would give Russia a potent foothold in the heart of the country, from which it might be able to add to its history of broken ceasefires and diplomatic promises.",
      "Ukrainian troops have for more than a year defended Pokrovsk. Now, most are pinned down in their positions, unable to move because of loitering Russian drones, and only resupplied by robotic tracked vehicles controlled remotely.",
      "Further northeast up the Donetsk front line, Russia claimed its forces had captured a string of villages, including Yampil.",
      "Meanwhile, in Zaporizhzhia, Russia has likely captured 15 villages since September, the Black Bird Group, a Finnish open-source intelligence agency, told The Kyiv Independent on Sunday.",
      "Last week, both sides traded familiar claims and denials of Russian victory in Kupiansk, in the eastern Kharkiv region, which Russian commander Sergei Kuzovlev told Putin was a \u201ckey cog in Ukraine\u2019s defenses.\u201d",
      "As of last Thursday, the general staff of the Ukrainian military said it was still under its control, deriding Russian \"propaganda\" that was \u201csolely aimed at concealing the critical losses of the Russian army.\"",
      "NBC News could not independently verify the battlefield accounts from either side.",
      "Putin has used these claims of victory to threaten Ukraine and Europe.",

      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Max Verstappen won the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Saturday night after capturing the lead from championship leader Lando Norris at the start and never looking back.",
      "The Formula 1 cars blasted down the Las Vegas Strip for 50 laps at breathtaking speeds of over 215 mph, delivering thrilling wheel-to-wheel racing under the bright lights for the third consecutive year.",
      "But in a stunning twist, both Norris and fellow McLaren driver Oscar Piastri were later disqualified in the middle of the night, hours after the race finish and podium celebrations, with officials finding illegal plank wear on their cars.",
      "Norris crossed the line in second place, ahead of title rival Piastri, who finished in fourth. Their disqualification carries huge implications for the world championship fight with just two more Grand Prix races and one \u201csprint\u201d left in the season.",
      "It puts Norris just 24 points ahead of both Piastri and four-time world champion Verstappen, who are tied on points in second place. Norris now has 390 points, while Piastri and Verstappen have 366.",
      "\u201cA frustrating end to today,\u201d Norris said in a statement. \u201cWe had to do some managing towards the end of the race and now we know it was due to some issues on our car, which have unfortunately resulted in us being disqualified.\u201d",
      "Piastri called it \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201cunfortunate.\u201d",
      "F1 rules require the wooden skid blocks under the cars to be at least 9 mm thick after a race in order to be deemed legal, a way to control ride height and contact with the ground. The penalty for failing to meet that standard is disqualification. It\u2019s rare, but not unheard of.",
      "McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said the breach was unintentional and apologized to Norris and Piastri \u201cfor the loss of points today, at a critical time in their Championship campaigns.\u201d He also apologized to McLaren partners and fans.",
      "\u201cWhile this outcome is extremely disappointing, we remain fully focused on the last two races of the season,\u201d Stella said.",
      "There are just two Grand Prix left in a 2025 season full of twists and turns \u2014 next weekend in Qatar and the weekend after in Abu Dhabi. The Qatar race features a shortened \u201csprint\u201d race, too, so there are a maximum of 58 points still up for grabs.",
      "\u201cThe upcoming weekends, we\u2019ll again try to win the race, and at the end of Abu Dhabi we\u2019ll see where we end up,\u201d Verstappen said of the title fight in a postrace interview ahead of the McLarens\u2019 disqualification.",
      "Norris started first but lost two positions in the opening corners after making an aggressive move to defend his lead, but ran wide on the first turn and got overtaken by Verstappen and George Russell. He eventually overtook Russell of Mercedes but couldn\u2019t get close to Verstappen, and he was forced to slow his pace toward the end due to a then-unknown issue with the car.",
      "Russell was promoted from third to second. Mercedes teammate Kimi Antonelli finished fifth but was moved up to third.",
      "\u201cI messed it up and made my life tougher into turn one,\u201d Norris said. \u201cBut even after that, we just weren\u2019t quick enough. ... I was pushing flat out and Max was still pulling away.\u201d",
      "Piastri fell a further six points behind Norris before the disqualification, but now they remain 24 points apart.",
      "An economic boost for Las Vegas",
      "Local leaders hope the race weekend will provide a much-needed economic boost to Las Vegas, which has struggled this year due to high costs and declining tourism, among other issues. Last year\u2019s Las Vegas Grand Prix delivered an economic impact of $934 million, according to one estimate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very important event. And I fully support all of our special events. We\u2019re not just the entertainment capital, we\u2019re the entertainment and sports capital,\u201d U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., who represents parts of the city, told NBC News ahead of the race. \u201cSo having a marquee event like this on the Las Vegas Strip is great, and it does a lot for our economy.\u201d",
      "F1 is looking to build on its momentum with American fans, having secured the races in Miami and Las Vegas \u2014 in addition to the long-standing Grand Prix in Austin \u2014 on the calendar for the long haul. It signed a five-year deal with Apple, which will take over the U.S. broadcast rights from ESPN starting next year.",
      "Celebrity sightings included musicians Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, actors Ben Affleck, Michael Douglas and Naomi Campbell, NBA All-Stars Magic Johnson and Jimmy Butler, and tennis player Taylor Fritz. Actor Catherine Zeta-Jones waved the checkered flag.",
      "The top three finishers were driven to the podium, which is located on the Strip at the Bellagio Fountain Club, in a pink LEGO-built Cadillac car driven by Terry Crews.",
      "Before the race, Ferrari superstar Lewis Hamilton took Beyonc\u00e9 on a hot lap around the circuit, a team spokesperson confirmed, as she was decked out in a Louis Vuitton custom racing suit. The two stars were spotted watching the race from the Ferrari garage.",
      "Also in attendance Saturday were Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel, who were given a tour of the paddock by F1 officials.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always kind of been a NASCAR fan and been learning a lot about F1 the last couple of years. And we\u2019re excited to see everybody race,\u201d Noem said, adding that she was getting a tour of the McLaren garage. Patel called Formula 1 \u201cone of the greatest sports,\u201d saying he\u2019s a McLaren fan.",
      "Rain brings chaos in qualifying",
      "The Friday qualifying session was thrown into chaos due to rain, which extracted every ounce of skill from the 20 drivers just to stay out of the barriers. The track, already known to have low grip even in dry conditions, was slippery and treacherous for most of the session.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to keep it on the track. Not crash. Not take yourself out,\u201d Norris said after taking pole position. \u201cOne day, I just hope \u2014 apart from having a two-seater F1 car \u2014 people can get that sensation of just how nerve-wracking and scary it can be at times. How unpredictable.\u201d",
      "And the Las Vegas paddock was abuzz with internal drama among several teams during the weekend.",
      "Piastri was asked about recently reposting an Instagram post that quoted F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone claiming McLaren \u201cprefers\u201d Norris because of his \u201chigh star quality\u201d and \u201cmarketing appeal.\u201d",
      "Asked about the repost, which was highlighted online by F1 content creators, Piastri told reporters it was an error.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said Friday after deleting it from his feed. \u201cI woke up this morning and saw it. So I don\u2019t know, maybe I accidentally did it. Obviously, it was not intentional. But yeah, I didn\u2019t know what had happened.\u201d",
      "Instagram has one-click reposts \u2014 unlike X, which requires users to click twice to confirm \u2014 making it easy to erroneously repost something while scrolling. Still, it added to a drama in which the Australian driver\u2019s fans have theorized that the British team favors his British teammate, a claim that McLaren firmly denies.",
      "Ferrari\u2019s two drivers downplayed recent comments by Ferrari chairperson John Elkann, who said they should \u201ctalk less and focus on driving\u201d \u2014 remarks slammed by critics as a gratuitous dig against Charles Leclerc and Hamilton after Ferrari\u2019s decision to build a new car for 2025 (rather than upgrade last year\u2019s version) backfired and led to a winless season so far.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always willing to do less media,\u201d Hamilton quipped.",
      "The seven-time world champion told reporters it\u2019s \u201cnot really\u201d possible to focus any more on driving than he already does. \u201cI wake up thinking about it. And I go to sleep thinking about it. And I think about it while I\u2019m sleeping,\u201d Hamilton said.",
      "Leclerc said the comment was a product of Elkann\u2019s ambition to maximize the team\u2019s potential. \u201cHe loves Ferrari. I love Ferrari. We all love Ferrari,\u201d Leclerc said. \u201cWhen he called me, he told me what were the intentions of these words, and that was very clear. It was a positive message, trying to be positive.\u201d",
      "Ferrari currently sits fourth in a close battle for second in the team championship, behind Mercedes and Red Bull. While the driver\u2019s title carries more glory, the constructors\u2019 championship is the one that awards cash prizes. Ferrari finished runner-up to McLaren last year in a close battle.",
      "While Hamilton said he takes no positives regarding his comeback from last place to a points finish, he enjoys racing in Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cI love coming to Vegas,\u201d he told reporters after the race. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really great city. Always get a great welcome here. This is the biggest crowd I think we\u2019ve seen, even though it\u2019s quite cold.\u201d",
      "And the activities of the weekend have evolved over the three years as F1 seeks a better balance between sport and show.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s certainly better than it was a few years ago. I think that was a bit too much for everyone,\u201d Norris said. \u201cMay as well be in Cirque du Soleil with what we were doing back then.\u201d"

      "The 18-carat Jules Jurgensen watch, engraved and given to Straus for his 43rd birthday in 1888 \u2014 the same year he became a partner in New York\u2019s iconic department store Macy\u2019s \u2014 was recovered from his body after the ship sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912.",

      "Two people were critically injured, two were seriously injured, and seven others were treated at the scene Thursday afternoon in the small community of Bella Coola, BC Emergency Health Services said in a statement.",
      "On Saturday, the BC Conservation Officer Service said the search for the bear expanded to include two additional grizzlies witnesses said were nearby during the incident.",
      "At a news conference Friday, Tamara Davidson, minister of environment and parks in the Canadian province, said that three children and one adult were seriously injured and remained hospitalized. Their relatives did not want to release the patients' latest conditions, she said.",

      "\"The number is expected to rise as the airstrikes continue, and some of the wounded are in critical condition,\" Khalil al-Daqran, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, told NBC News.",
      "The Israeli strikes came as international momentum was building on Gaza, with the U.N. Security Council on Monday approving the U.S. blueprint to secure and govern the territory. It authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security, approves a transitional authority to be overseen by President Donald Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Israel has previously carried out similar waves of strikes after reported attacks on its forces. At least 33 Palestinians were killed over a 12-hour period Wednesday and Thursday, mostly women and children, health officials said.",
      "One of Saturday's strikes targeted a vehicle, killing 11 and wounding over 20 Palestinians in Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood, said Rami Mhanna, managing director of Shifa Hospital, where the casualties were taken. The majority of the wounded were children, director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said. Associated Press video showed children and others inspecting the blackened vehicle, whose top was blown off.",
      "Another strike targeting a house near Al-Awda Hospital in central Gaza killed at least three people and wounded 11 others, according to the hospital. It said a strike on a house in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza killed at least seven people including a child and wounded 16 others.",
      "And a strike targeting a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed three people, including a woman, according to Al-Aqsa Hospital.",

      "Israel's military in a statement said it launched attacks against Hamas after an \"armed terrorist\" crossed into an Israeli-held area and shot at troops in southern Gaza. It said no soldiers were hurt. The military said the person had used a road on which humanitarian aid enters the territory, and called it an \"extreme violation\" of the ceasefire.",
      "In separate statements, the military said soldiers killed five \"terrorists\" in the Rafah area, and two others after firing at four people who crossed into Israeli-held areas in northern Gaza and advanced toward soldiers in two separate incidents.",
      "The war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people and took over 250 hostage. Almost all of the hostages or their remains have been returned in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "Gaza's Health Ministry says 69,733 Palestinians have been killed and 170,863 injured in Israel's retaliatory offensive. The toll has gone up during the ceasefire both from new Israeli strikes and from the recovery and identification of bodies of people killed earlier in the war.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts."

      "\u201cAnd now we will see yet another panicked scramble by European leaders to head off an outcome that would be disastrous for their own security,\u201d he said, adding that the European response toward \u201crepeated disastrous peace plans has been in words, not action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere should be nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said Friday in a post on X, adding European leaders will also meet in Angola next week.",
      "Ukraine must have a \u201cdecisive voice in peace talks,\u201d Polish President Karol Nawrocki said late Friday on X. \u201cThe price of peace cannot in any way be the achievement of strategic goals by the aggressor, and the aggressor was and remains the Russian Federation,\u201d he added.",
      "As European leaders mulled over the plan on the G20 summit\u2019s sidelines, notably absent was Trump, who is boycotting the event over his unfounded claims that South Africa\u2019s white minority is subject to hate crimes and land grabs.",
      "While Trump initially said Vice President JD Vance would attend, he later said there would be no U.S. delegation taking part. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has an International Criminal Court warrant calling for his arrest, is also not attending.",
      "How much Europe will actually be able to influence the plan without U.S. involvement remains an open question, and one with implications for both Ukraine\u2019s borders and peace for the broader continent.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t influence this,\u201d said Bociurkiw. \u201cIt makes NATO and Europe look weak, and Putin will go on and on to cause more disruptions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a speed train and you have Putin and Trump on it, and then you have Zelenskyy on the departure platform and Europe stuck at the check-in counter,\u201d he added.",
      "Giles said the military aspects of the peace plan leave Ukraine effectively defenseless against a future Russian attack.",
      "\u201cAnd since Ukraine forms the front line of the defense of Europe, this is a potentially disastrous outcome for the continent as a whole,\u201d Giles said.",
      "Lawmakers in Ukraine aren\u2019t particularly happy with the plan either, with Victoria Podgorna from Zelenskyy\u2019s political party saying it was giving Russia \u201camnesty for launching a brutal war.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Friday he had spoken with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his counterparts in Germany and France, adding that he would also talk to Washington to ensure Kyiv\u2019s \u201cprincipled stances are taken into account.\u201d",
      "\u201cUkraine may now face a very difficult choice, either losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner, either the difficult 28 points, or a very difficult winter,\u201d Zelenskyy said, warning his country of a \u201cvery difficult, eventful\u201d week ahead.",
      "His warning also came as Ukraine suffers setbacks on the battlefield and Zelenskyy tries to contain the fallout from a $100 million corruption scandal implicating his top officials.",
      "On Saturday, the Russian defense ministry said it had captured two additional villages in eastern Ukraine, one in the Donetsk region and another in Zaporizhzhia.",
      "Russia's gains, both on the battlefield and in the proposed plan, have drawn a positive response from the Kremlin, where Putin has said it could \u201cform the basis of a final peace settlement,\u201d though adding it was not \u201csubstantively\u201d discussed with Russia.",
      "Meanwhile, two people were killed in Russia\u2019s southern city of Syzran in a Ukrainian strike on energy facilities, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Fedorishchev, said Saturday on Russia\u2019s state-backed Max messenger app."
