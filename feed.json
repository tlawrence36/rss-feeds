      "Former teen idol Bobby Sherman has died at 81",
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and \u201970s with bubblegum pop hits like \u201cLittle Woman\u201d and \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d has died. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \u201cBobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace.\u201d Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky-clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunchboxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide\u2019s list of \u201cTV\u2019s 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\u201d",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the \u201960s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d \u201cEasy Come, Easy Go,\u201d and \u201cLa La La (If I Had You).\u201d He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \u201cHere Comes Bobby,\u201d which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump start when he was cast in the ABC rock \u2019n\u2019 roll show \u201cShindig!\u201d in the mid-\u201960s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \u201cHere Come the Brides\u201d (1968-70) and \u201cGetting Together\u201d (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, people say, \u2018Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?\u2019\u201d he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019d change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could\u2019ve relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\u201d",
      "Sherman, with sky blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high-school rock band.",
      "\u201cI was brought up in a fairly strict family,\u201d he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \u201cLaw and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people\u2019s feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn\u2019t do things just to be mischievous.\u201d",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \u201cShindig!\u201d",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \u201cHere Come the Brides,\u201d a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show\u2019s theme song, \u201cSeattle,\u201d and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \u201cGetting Together,\u201d a spinoff of \u201cThe Partridge Family,\u201d about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman\u2019s smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\u201d The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \u201cWild In Streets,\u201d \u201cHe is My Brother\u201d and \u201cGet Crazy.\u201d",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \u201cI\u2019d film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn\u2019t know what home was.\u201d",
      "Sherman\u2019s pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses and he became the family\u2019s first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cIf I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I\u2019m in my own car,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times. \u201cI carry equipment with me. And there\u2019s not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\u201d",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman\u2019s partner what his name was. \u201cWhen he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn\u2019t tell her my name was Sherman,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD\u2019s Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI\u2019s Exceptional Service Award and the \u201cTwice a Citizen\u201d Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon wrote: \u201cBobby is a stellar example of the statement \u2018to protect and serve.\u2019 We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\u201d",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \u201cTeen Idols Tour\u201d with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman\u2019s Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman\u2019s performances: \u201cDressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with \u2018Easy Come, Easy Go.\u2019 As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\u201d",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children\u2019s Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health, and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",
      "\u201cEven in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That\u2019s who Bobby was \u2014 brave, gentle, and full of light,\u201d Poublon wrote.",

      "Mick Ralphs, the singer, songwriter, guitarist and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died",
      "Mick Ralphs, a guitarist, singer, songwriter and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died.",
      "A statement posted to Bad Company's official website Monday announced Ralphs' death at age 81. Ralphs had a stroke days after what would be his final performance with the band at London's O2 Arena in 2016, and had been bedridden ever since, the statement said. No further details on the circumstances of his death were provided.",
      "Ralphs is set to become a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bad Company in November.",
      "\u201cOur Mick has passed, my heart just hit the ground,\" Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers said in a statement. \u201cHe has left us with exceptional songs and memories. He was my friend, my songwriting partner, an amazing and versatile guitarist who had the greatest sense of humour.\u201d",
      "Ralphs wrote the 1970's song \u201cReady for Love\u201d for Mott the Hoople, later revamped for Bad Company's 1974 debut album, which also included the Ralphs-penned hit \u201cCan't Get Enough.\u201d He co-wrote Bad Company's 1975 classic \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d with Rodgers.",
      "Born in Stoke Lacy, Herefordshire, England, Ralphs began playing blues guitar as a teenager, and in his early 20s in 1966, he co-founded the Doc Thomas Group. In 1969, the band would become Mott the Hoople, a name taken from the title and title character of a 1966 novel by Willard Manus.",
      "The group's self-titled first album, recorded in a week, won a cult following, but the two that followed were critical and financial flops. They finally found popular success and became glam-rock giants with the 1972 David Bowie-penned-and-produced song \u201cAll the Young Dudes.\" But Ralphs felt creatively cramped in the band led by singer-songwriter Ian Hunter and left in 1973.",
      "He would soon form Bad Company with Rodgers, a singer who had left his own band, Free.",
      "The two had intended only to write songs together, and possibly to make a one-off album as a project. But when Free drummer Simon Kirke asked to sit in, they realized they were nearly a proper group already and went seeking a bassist. They found him in former King Crimson member Boz Burrell.",
      "\u201cWe didn't actually plan to have a band,\u201d Ralphs said in a 2015 interview with Gibson Guitars. \u201cIt was all kind of accidental I suppose. Lucky, really.\u201d",
      "Kirke said in a statement Monday that Ralphs was \u201ca dear friend, a wonderful songwriter, and an exceptional guitarist. We will miss him deeply.\"",
      "Bad Company found immediate success. its albums were full of radio-ready anthems, and its live sound was perfectly suited to the 1970s height of arena rock.",
      "Their self-titled debut album went to No. 1 on Billboard's album chart. And Ralphs' \u201cCan't Get Enough\u201d \u2014 often mistakenly called \u201cCan\u2019t Get Enough of Your Love\u201d because of its chorus lyrics \u2014 would be their biggest hit single, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.",
      "\u201cWe actually did the whole thing in one take live,\u201d Ralphs said in the Gibson interview. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but we just said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s great, it\u2019s going to capture the moment.\u2019 That\u2019s what I like to do in recording. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect as long as it captures the moment. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",
      "Bad Company's 1975 follow-up, \u201cStraight Shooter,\u201d was also a hit, going to No. 3 on album charts in both the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. and the UK Albums Chart.",
      "Its opening track, \u201cGood Lovin' Gone Bad,\u201d written by Ralphs, was a modest hit, and the song that followed it, \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love,\u201d was a big one that would remain in rotation on classic rock radio for decades.",
      "The band's statement says Ralphs is survived by \u201cthe love of his life,\u201d his wife Susie Chavasse, along with two children, three step-children and \u201cbeloved bandmates\u201d Rodgers and Kirke.",
      "\u201cOur last conversation a few days ago we shared a laugh,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be our last.\u201d",

      "MILAN -- Giorgio Armani\u2019s menswear collection for the next warm weather season encoded the geography of summer in textures, geometrical designs and his signature relaxed silhouettes.",
      "The 90-year-old designer skipped the runway preview show closing Milan Fashion Week on Monday to recover from an undisclosed condition, but his fashion house said he kept a hand in the designs and watched the runway show on livestream.",
      "It was the first time in his career that the designer was absent.",
      "Taking the closing bow in his stead was Armani\u2019s longtime head of menswear, Leo Dell\u2019Orco, who has worked alongside Armani for 45 of the Giorgio Armani fashion house\u2019s 50 years.",
      "\u201cHe liked it,\u2019\u2019 Dell\u2019Orco told reporters after the show, adding that Armani was especially happy to see that he had sent male-female couples down the mostly menswear runway in matching looks, underlining their versatility.",
      "The collection was classic Armani: roomy wide pleated trousers paired with a seemingly endless array of softly constructed jackets, from a double-breasted made casual with shawl collars to shirt-weight leather coats. Vests with a deep-V front substituted for shirts, for looks that transition from work to leisure.",
      "The collection found balance in the melding of textures \u2013 raw linen, woven leather, soft suede and flowing silk. From a distance, ensembles may have appeared monochromatic, but a closer look revealed a harmonious blending of seemingly mismatched geometrical patterns and textures, adding depth to the looks.",
      "There was a touch of the exotic in the shapes, like Nehru collar, tunics or a kimono jacket, reflecting Armani\u2019s love of travel, without overwhelming the mood.",
      "Delicate decorative pins reflected the light, the sole adornment. Beachy touches included rope sandals and belts, which cinched through a loop.",
      "The showroom was awash in Mediterranean blue and featured installations of obsidian black stones, reflecting the sophisticated color palette that included washed-out desert shades, the palest green, deep blues and urban blacks and gray.",
      "Front-row guests included actors Giancarlo Esposito, who most recently appeared in \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u2019\u2019 and Jason Isaacs, who was in the third season of \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Twenty-five years ago, a little girl with a bob haircut appeared on our TVs, speaking a mix of English and Spanish, with a spunky, can-do spirit. She had an adventure planned, a backpack, a monkey friend and upbeat songs.",
      "\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dora. What\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked.",
      "This was, of course, \u201cDora the Explorer,\u201d the first Latina to lead a major cartoon series and the girl who helped spearhead the rise of multicultural children\u2019s programming in the U.S. on her way to becoming a cultural phenomenon.",
      "\u201cThe show allowed Latinos to be depicted on TV as educators, teaching viewers how to speak our language, and yet at the same time, just teaching ordinary things that children need to learn,\u201d said Brenda Victoria Castillo, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition.",
      "Nickelodeon is celebrating Dora\u2019s 25th anniversary with the feature-length live-action movie \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d a third season of the rebooted animated series \u201cDora,\u201d the podcast Dora\u2019s Mermaid Adventures, an album of songs and plenty of toys and apparel.",
      "\u201cThe great thing about Dora is that, yes, she celebrates Latin culture through every aspect \u2014 language, food, dress and music,\u201d says Ramsey Naito president of animation at Paramount and Nickelodeon. \u201cBut she also empowers everybody to be their true self and to be brave. She\u2019s not exclusive. She\u2019s inclusive.\u201d",
      "Kathleen Herles had a special vantage point to see Dora's influence: She was the original voice of the pint-size heroine, cast in the role when she was 7 and staying until she was 18 and off to college.",
      "\u201cIt has been the longest journey and the greatest adventure of my life \u2014 no pun intended,\u201d said Herles, who grew up in New York City to parents of Peruvian descent.",
      "On the convention circuit, Herles would see firsthand the power of Dora. \u201cI remember I would make kids cry, not intentionally,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir mind goes to a memory, to a moment, it's just incredible. It\u2019s so special, it\u2019s magical.\u201d",
      "Herles has lately been the voice actor for Dora's mom on \u201cDora,\u201d the reboot that started in 2024. It's a full-circle moment for the actor and singer: \u201cIt changed my life forever, twice.\u201d",
      "\u201cDora the Explorer\u201d led to what Herles laughingly calls the \u201cDora-verse\u201d \u2014 the spinoff series \u201cGo, Diego, Go!,\u201d a sequel series \u201cDora and Friends: Into the City!\u201d and the 2019 live-action feature film \u201cDora and the Lost City of Gold,\u201d starring Isabela Merced, Eva Longoria and Michael Pe\u00f1a.",
      "\u201cDora\u201d co-creator Chris Gifford has watched his creation age up and down and take human form. \u201cShe has been older and she has been younger and she has a hair clip now,\u201d he says. \u201cHer essence, her positive spirit, her I-can-do-anything-with-your-help attitude has stuck through.\u201d",
      "Dora is firmly part of the culture, as big as her Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon. There's a reference to her in \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d she's been mocked on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and if you look carefully at the PBS show \u201cAlma's Way,\u201d you can see a Dora doll in that heroine's bedroom. TikTok users have embraced the \u201cBackpack Song.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose kids coming of age now \u2014 the ones who 25 years ago were just watching it as little preschoolers \u2014 they\u2019re out there and they\u2019re remembering,\u201d says Valerie Walsh Valdes, co-creator of the original series and an executive producer on the new series and movie.",
      "Valdes and Gifford originally had the idea for a show about a little girl who was a problem solver. Like \u201cBlue's Clues,\u201d it would reward kids for figuring out answers posed by the host.",
      "\u201cPreschoolers are the least powerful people in our world,\u201d says Gifford. \u201cThey're not able to button their sweater and not able to tie their shoes, but if they\u2019re able to help Dora get to the City of Lost Toys and really feel like they helped, that\u2019s something special.\u201d",
      "Nickelodeon suggested the girl be Latina and the creators ran with it, making her pan-Latina so no one would feel excluded. Latin representation on TV \u2014 then and now \u2014 has been a struggle.",
      "The Latino Donor Collaborative\u2019s 2024 Latinos in Media report found that Latino actors made up 9.8% of the main cast in lead, co-lead and ensemble roles in scripted shows. In non-scripted television, Latino hosts made up only 5% of host roles. That\u2019s despite Latin people making up nearly 20% of the country.",
      "\u201cThere were few programs at the time that featured Latina protagonists with Dora\u2019s skin tone or features, so from that perspective, the representation is valuable,\u201d says Erynn Masi de Casanova, head of the Sociology Department at the University of Cincinnati.",
      "Dora was put in an animated world inside a computer, and the creators asked kids to help make the show better. They hired education consultants to tease out the skills Dora teaches, like spatial understanding and interpersonal. They brought in language and culture experts.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d became her signature song.",
      "The series is seen in more than 150 countries and territories and translated in 32 languages on Nickelodeon channels and Paramount+. In English-speaking countries such as the United States and Australia, Dora teaches Spanish; in other markets \u2014 including the Hispanic U.S. markets \u2014 she teaches English.",
      "Samantha Lorraine, 18, who grew up in Miami of Cuban heritage, had the Dora T-shirts and backpack. She laughs that she once even had the Dora bob.",
      "In July, she's starring as Dora in \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d which was filmed in Colombia. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my audition since day one,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be stepping into Dora\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s such a huge legacy,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to be a part of representation where it counts. And Dora is the epitome of that.\u201d",
      "Castillo, of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, puts Dora up there with Mickey Mouse in terms of an instantly recognized cultural character and says she's relevant more than ever.",
      "\u201cWe need more Doras,\u201d she says. \u201cIf people were just open to being educated in other people\u2019s languages and cultures and beliefs and not see it as a threat, we wouldn\u2019t be in the situation that we\u2019re in this country and the world.\u201d",

      "The academy, a workshop taught over five months, tackles some serious topics like to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma.",
      "\u201cWe call it yoga for social skills,\u201d said Leonard, the vice president of Creative Strategy, Innovation and Business Development at The Second City.",
      "The skills might not apply to all policing situations in the field, but being a better listener or learning to take a breath before responding can make for better leaders, according to Tree Branch, a strategic client partner at The Second City Works.",
      "The creation of improv and of The Second City is rooted in social work. Both trace their beginnings to Viola Spolin, who created some of the exercises still used in improv while she was a resettlement worker in the 1920s helping immigrant children and local Chicago children connect. Spolin was also the mother of Second City cofounder, Paul Sills.",
      "The Policing Leadership Academy's creators believe those skills can also help meet their goals to increase community engagement, improve officer morale and ultimately reduce violent crime.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to make the case that you can do all three things,\" without compromising one over the other, said Kim Smith, director of programs at the Crime Lab.",
      "The academy is focused on working with leaders from departments dealing with high levels of community gun violence and pays for them to fly to Chicago one week a month to attend the five-month training.",
      "Crime Lab researchers found that district and precinct captains have the largest potential impact on their colleagues, despite often receiving little leadership training for the job. A precinct could have high marks for morale, community relationships, or be making a dent in crime numbers, but if the captain changes, those gains could plummet, researchers found, even if the community, the officers and everything else stayed the same.",
      "Professors, researchers and police leaders teach courses on topics like developing transparent policing cultures, using and collecting data, managing stress and building community partnerships. So far, about 130 police leaders from about 70 departments including tribal police departments and even a police inspector from Toronto have participated.",
      "Capt. Louis Higginson with the Philadelphia Police Department said the academy provided a much broader training than the two weeks of police job training he got before being promoted to captain a little more than a year ago.",
      "\u201cThe big thing for me was thinking about the things we allow to happen because they\u2019ve been that way before us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ways we can change the culture of our district by changing the thinking around why we do things.\u201d",
      "He said he did some of the improv exercises with his wife and daughters when he returned home and it opened up communication in a way he hadn\u2019t expected.",
      "\u201cI think it opened their eyes, like it did for me,\u201d Higginson said.",
      "Albuquerque Police Department Commander Ray Del Greco said he\u2019s still thinking more about how he communicates weeks after the improv class.",
      "\u201cWhen people talk to you and come to have you help solve their issues, to be able to push your ego out and worry less about your own agenda and listen, that\u2019s an understanding of leadership,\u201d Del Greco said. \u201cTo me that was the most valuable class we had.\u201d",
      "Academy leaders stressed the learning doesn't stop at graduation. They create communication channels so classmates can continue to support each other, they encourage captains to put on trainings with their departments, and participants are required to implement a capstone project that lasts well past the last day of class and addresses a real problem in their district or department.",
      "Many of the projects implement programs to address specific crimes, like involving the community in programs to prevent car thefts or piloting drones as first responders. One previous graduate created a partnership with community groups to increase community pride and reduce gun violence by reducing quality of life issues like littering, overgrown lots and graffiti.",
      "Stephen Donohue, a San Jose Police Department captain and recent academy graduate, is creating an early intervention system focusing on officer wellness. A typical system might flag citizen complaints or driving accidents, but Donohue's program gathers input from supervisors and peers to flag when an officer is taking on too much on-duty trauma, such as multiple murders or shooting investigations within a short time.",
      "\u201cIt's a Venn diagram between training, wellness and internal affairs,\" he said. \"And we can help them, we can lessen use-of-force complaints and allegations, offer better training and improve services put out by the department.\u201d",
      "The trainers hope in a few years more captains and officers will be saying \u201cyes and\u201d during improv classes. They are keeping tabs through a randomized control study on how well the overall training works. And with that evidence they hope funders, police departments or other universities will help expand the trainings to more departments.",
      "\u201cWe want there to be rigorously tested scientific evidence behind this,\u201d said Academy Executive Director Meredith Stricker. \u201cWe work to design a curriculum to ultimately make better leaders and better policing. The participants definitely talk about the improv class as one of their favorites. We hope all of it will work in tandem.\u201d",

      "ROME -- Arnaldo Pomodoro, one of Italy's most prominent contemporary artists whose bronze spheres decorate iconic public spaces from the Vatican to the United Nations, has died at age 98, his foundation said Monday.",
      "Pomodoro died at home in Milan on Sunday, the eve of his 99th birthday, according to a statement from Carlotta Montebello, director general of the Arnaldo Pomodoro Foundation.",
      "Pomodoro\u2019s massive spheres are instantly recognizable: shiny, smooth bronze globes with clawed out interiors that Pomodoro has said referred to the superficial perfection of exteriors and the troubled complexity of interiors.",

      "The Vatican\u2019s sphere, which occupies a central place in the Pigna Courtyard of the Vatican Museums, features an internal mechanism that rotates with the wind. \u201cIn my work I see the cracks, the eroded parts, the destructive potential that emerges from our time of disillusionment,\u201d the Vatican quoted Pomodoro as saying about its sphere.",
      "The United Nations in New York received a 3.3-meter (10 foot, eight inch) diameter \u201cSphere Within Sphere\u201d sculpture as a gift from Italy in 1996. The U.N. sphere has refers to the coming of the new millennium, the U.N. said: \u201ca smooth exterior womb erupted by complex interior forms,\u201d and \u201ca promise for the rebirth of a less troubled and destructive world,\u201d Pomodoro said of it.",
      "Other spheres are located at museums around the world and outside the Italian foreign ministry, which has the original work that Pomodoro created in 1966 for the Montreal Expo that began his monumental sculpture project.",
      "Pomodoro was born in Montefeltro, Italy, on June 23, 1926. In addition to his spheres, he designed theatrical sets, land projects and machines. He had multiple retrospectives and taught at Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and Mills College, according to his biography on the foundation website.",

      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" is maintaining its top ranking in movie theaters",
      "NEW YORK -- Neither Pixar nor zombies were enough to topple \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" from the No. 1 slot at North American box offices over the weekend. The Universal Pictures live-action remake remained the top film, bringing in $37 million in ticket sales in its second weekend, despite the sizeable new releases of \u201cElio\u201d and \u201c28 Years Later.\u201d , according to studio estimates Sunday. \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has rapidly amassed $358.2 million worldwide.",
      "Six years after its last entry, the Dean DeBlois-directed \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has proven a potent revival of the DreamWorks Animation franchise. A sequel is already in the works for the $150 million production, which remakes the 2010 animated tale about a Viking boy and his dragon.",
      "Pixar's \u201cElio\u201d had a particularly tough weekend. The Walt Disney Co. animation studio has often launched some of its biggest titles in June, including \u201cCars,\u201d \u201cWALL-E\u201d and \u201cToy Story 4.\u201d But \u201cElio,\u201d a science fiction adventure about a boy who dreams of meeting aliens, notched a modest $21 million, the lowest opening ever for Pixar.",
      "\u201cThis is a weak opening for a new Pixar movie,\u201d said David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm FranchiseRe. \u201cThese would be solid numbers for another original animation film, but this is Pixar, and by Pixar\u2019s remarkable standard, the opening is well below average.\u201d",
      "\u201cElio,\u201d originally set for release in early 2024, had a bumpy road to the screen. Adrian Molina \u2014 co-director of \u201cCoco\u201d \u2014 was replaced mid-production by Domee Shi (\u201cTurning Red\u201d) and Madeline Sharafian. Back at Disney\u2019s D23 conference in 2022, America Ferrera appeared to announce her role as Elio\u2019s mother, but the character doesn\u2019t even exist in the revamped film.",
      "Disney and Pixar spent at least $150 million making \u201cElio,\u201d which didn\u2019t fare any better internationally than it did in North America, bringing in just $14 million from 43 territories. Pixar stumbled coming out of the pandemic before stabilizing performance with 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d ($496.4 million worldwide) and 2024\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d ($1.7 billion), which was the company's biggest box office hit.",
      "\u201cElemental\u201d was Pixar's previously lowest earning film, launching with $29.6 million. It rallied in later weeks to collect nearly half a billion dollars at the box office. The company's first movie, \u201cToy Story,\u201d opened with $29.1 million in 1995, or $60 when adjusted for inflation. It remains to be seen whether \u201cElio's\u201d decent reviews and \u201cA\u201d from CinemaScore audiences can lead it to repeat \u201cElemental's\u201d trajectory.",
      "With most schools on summer break, the competition for family audiences was stiff. Disney\u2019s own \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d another live-action remake, continued to pull in young moviegoers. It grossed $9.7 million in its fifth weekend, bringing its global tally to $910.3 million. .",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d signaled the return of another, far gorier franchise. Director Danny Boyle reunited with screenwriter Alex Garland to resume their pandemic apocalypse thriller 25 years after \u201c28 Days Later\u201d and 18 years after its sequel, \u201c28 Weeks Later.\u201d",
      "The Sony Pictures release opened with $30 million. That was good enough to give Boyle, the filmmaker of \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201cTrainspotting,\u201d the biggest opening weekend of his career. The film, which cost $60 million to make, jumps ahead nearly three decades from the outbreak of the so-called rage virus for a coming-of-age story about a 12-year-old (Alfie Williams) venturing out of his family\u2019s protected village. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes co-star.",
      "Reviews have been good (90% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) for \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d though audience reaction (a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore) is mixed. Boyle has more plans for the zombie franchise, which will next see the release of \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d next year from director Nia DaCosta.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d added another $30 million in 59 overseas markets.",
      "After its strong start last weekend with $12 million, A24\u2019s \u201cMaterialists\u201d held well with $5.8 million in its second weekend. The romantic drama by writer-director Celine Song and starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans has collected $24 million so far.",
      "Next weekend should also be a competitive one in movie theaters, with both \u201cF1,\u201d from Apple and Warner Bros., and Universal\u2019s \u201cMegan 2.0\u201d launching in cinemas.",
      "With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",

      "Born Robert Sylvester Kelly, the 58-year-old Grammy-winning R&B singer is serving sentences at a prison in Butner, North Carolina, for child sex crimes and racketeering.",
      "Pacold noted that federal courts have only limited power in such cases, and one by one she examined and rejected various ways Kelly's request could be considered.",
      "\u201cJurisdictional limitations must be respected even where, as here, a litigant claims that the circumstances are extraordinary,\u201d Pacold wrote. \"Kelly has not identified (nor is the court aware of) any statute or rule that authorizes the court to exercise jurisdiction.

      "NEW YORK -- A sheer dress silhouetting a black body suit, Usher\u2019s signature crowd interaction and a tweet from her child\u2019s father: that concoction created a nearly two-week social media frenzy starring Keke Palmer back in 2023. Now, the multi-hyphenate creative has channeled that experience into her new album, \u201cJust Keke.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was tough \u2026 I didn\u2019t even realize I was in such grief,\u201d said the 31-year-old about the fallout of her extremely public breakup with her ex, Darius Jackson. \u201cI get to put that same emotion into a song, and I get tell those people that\u2019s been watching me since I was nine \u2026 what\u2019s going on in a way that it can translate.\u201d",
      "Following 2023\u2019s \u201cBig Boss,\u201d her third solo studio project, out now, is an 18-track visual album conceptualized and directed by Palmer and her team. Tayla Parx, who\u2019s written for Alicia Keys, Justin Bieber and Dua Lipa, handled the bulk of the writing and executive produced with Palmer. The storyline follows Palmer musically navigating celebrity, motherhood and self-reflection. But her vulnerability about her well-publicized relationship drama is the album\u2019s throughline.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what artistry is \u2026 mine is about transmutation, it\u2019s about bringing closure,\u201d said Palmer, who\u2019s usually mum about her romantic relationships. \u201cI have to address something that I would never address, especially nothing on an intimate level \u2014 that\u2019s just so not me. But I knew that I had to because now that it\u2019s become public, it\u2019s become a part of my work, and I have to respond to it as such. And that just caused me to have to grow.\u201d",
      "While attending Usher\u2019s popular Las Vegas residency in 2023, the Emmy winner danced closely with the music icon during his routine audience interaction segment. Social videos of the interaction prompted a viral tweet from Jackson, her ex-boyfriend and child\u2019s father, criticizing her attire, writing, \u201cIt\u2019s the outfit tho.. you a mom.\u201d",
      "While he was quickly admonished online, the conversation eventually moved beyond social media to articles and think pieces tackling subjects ranging from patriarchy, women\u2019s attire, and having children before marriage.",
      "Standout tracks on \u201cJust Keke\u201d include \u201cMy Confession\u201d \u2014 a tongue-in-cheek interpolation of Usher\u2019s hit \"Confessions, Pt. II\" \u2014 as well as the previously released \"125 Degrees\u201d and \u201cOff Script.\u201d She passionately belts out her love on the ballad \u201cUnless It\u2019s You,\u201d while \u201cMisunderstood\u201d finds her asking, \u201cDon\u2019t you see me throwing out a lifeline? / You too busy pinning me the bad guy / Maybe we ain\u2019t doing what we should / or maybe we\u2019re just misunderstood.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat the project, I think, speaks to as well is just like reclamation,\u201d said the \u201cNope\u201d star, admitting the album could reignite criticism about her personal life. \u201cI\u2019m just Keke, hate it or love it. This is me, this is my story, this is how I see things, I see my life \u2026 the whole point of it, too, is making peace with just saying what you got to say and letting it be that.\u201d",
      "While Palmer\u2019s mic is still hot, she\u2019s extremely booked and busy on Hollywood lots: a sequel to \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d and she stars with Eddie Murphy and Pete Davidson in \u201cThe Pickup\u201d from Prime Video in August. The \u201cAkeelah and the Bee\u201d actor will lead Peacock\u2019s upcoming TV adaptation of Mel Brook\u2019s \u201cThe \u2019Burbs,\u201d and she\u2019ll join the team on \u201cSpaceballs 2\u201d with original stars Bill Pullman and Rick Moranis, the latter a reclusive \u201880s and \u201990s star who\u2019s since largely stayed out of Hollywood.",
      "Palmer says she\u2019ll judge the success of \u201cJust Keke\u201d not necessarily by sales or Billboard charts, but by potential opportunities that arise, whether it\u2019s creating and directing visual albums for other artists, helming her own musical and comedic variety show, or even embarking on her own world tour.",
      "\u201cIt could look like so many things, and I\u2019m open to all of them,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cAs long as I know that I put my all into this, I know I can\u2019t lose.\u201d",

      "The resulting film, \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\u201d is an intimate look at her life: Growing up in a hearing family; winning the best actress Oscar at 21 for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d which film critic Rex Reed at the time called a \u201cpity vote\u201d; what she's described as an abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; getting sober; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "It\u2019s also an evocative portal into the world of the deaf community that uses groundbreaking techniques and sound design to put American Sign Language (ASL) and visual communication first. The film opens in select theaters Friday.",
      "While Matlin told much of her story in the memoir \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later,\u201d on some level it wasn\u2019t a completely satisfactory experience. Before the #MeToo movement, its revelations were not treated entirely seriously in the media. But a documentary also provided an opportunity.",
      "\u201cWe communicate visually,\u201d she said.",
      "Matlin and Stern spoke though translators to The Associated Press about the \u201cCODA\u201d effect, making the doc on their terms, and why they hope Reed sees this film. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "STERN: I had never seen a deaf person direct an episode of TV or film. Never. I thought, what does that even look like? I didn\u2019t realize until I took the job that really the whole form of documentary as we know it is really rooted in sound, in the assumption that people will be speaking and they can speak. I thought, what are we going to do when we\u2019re using American Sign Language? I have to reframe a whole form of documentary. We have to be able to see what a visually-based documentary is going to look like.",
      "We wouldn\u2019t do justice to Marlee\u2019s life if I had forced this form that really wasn\u2019t rooted in the way that she experienced this life. And that was exciting to do. Scary for some people out there, but I never felt scared in making this documentary because she believed in me.",
      "MATLIN: If I had had a hearing director approach me to do this project, we could have done a very good job, but that person would not have seen me in the same way. They would not have the same lens as a deaf person.",
      "STERN: I did want to film with captions in mind, so I made sure that we did have a wider frame. We figured out visual voiceover with a split screen that we added. We did this little surgery with words and syllables in one of the scenes where we mixed them all around to be able to bring people into how Marlee experiences conversations and the world. We wanted to make this documentary an immersive experience for the audience members, a sensory experience to help them understand.",
      "MATLIN: \u201cCODA\u201d certainly was a milestone and respected by so many people in the industry. It tackled a lot of things that both deaf and hearing people or audiences can identify with. I love the fact that they burnt in the captions. That you can\u2019t just turn it off.",
      "And I hoped that all the love we received and the three Academy Awards that we got would make a difference. It was honored on so many other levels too as well, whether we\u2019re talking about (director) Sian (Heder) or you\u2019re talking about Troy (Kotsur) or the SAG award which was just a dream come true, specifically of mine. I took that opportunity to specifically address that that we \u201cexist,\u201d that we want to be actors just like you, we want to be directors, we want be producers, we want to be hair and wardrobe stylists. We want to work in all levels of production. So \u201cCODA\u201d really elevated that conversation about how much we wanted to be part of the industry. But for some reason it didn\u2019t really break open the door as wide as I would have thought. Yet we just don\u2019t give up. We are persistent. Because it is what it is. We are working on our own levels to make changes.",
      "STERN: Marlee said something really brave when we were at Sundance. She said, \u201cIt won\u2019t last.\u201d The moment, yes, in the moment. But I don\u2019t know if we have movement.",
      "MATLIN: There\u2019s so many stories that we can tell, so many stories that you can put up on screen, so many stories that we can put on stage.",
      "I\u2019d like to see action because I\u2019ve been hearing that, \u201cYes, we have to do this\u201d or \u201cI will do this,\u201d but it\u2019s been 40 years. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m complaining. I just want to make sure that we put our money where our mouth is.",
      "I go back to that comment about Rex Reed. I wonder if he would ever see this film. I\u2019d love to see if he has the balls to make a comment and say, \"Oh look, I realize I might have said something wrong.\"",
      "That\u2019s just one example of the things I\u2019d like to see happen. And maybe the people who interviewed me over the years. I don\u2019t want you to misunderstand me, I have a great deal of respect for them. But specifically, I am calling out Rex Reed. So, you know, sorry but not sorry.",

      "For all the pageantry \u2014 throne, swords, the Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honor \u2014 the auction's true power comes from its intimacy. It includes the handwritten codicil of Napoleon's final will, composed in paranoia and illness on Saint Helena.",
      "There is the heartbreakingly personal: the red portfolio that once contained his divorce decree from Josephine, the religious marriage certificate that formalized their love and a dressing table designed for the empress. Her famed mirror reflects the ambition and tragedy of their alliance.",

      "The auction's timing is cinematic. The 2023 biopic grossed over $220 million worldwide and reanimated Napoleon\u2019s myth for a TikTok generation hungry for stories of ambition, downfall and doomed romance.",

      "\u201cYou can\u2019t escape him, even if you wanted to. He\u2019s part of being French,\" said teacher Laure Mallet, 51.",
      "The exhibition is a spectacle crafted by celebrity designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, famed for dressing Lady Gaga and Pope John Paul II.",
      "\u201cI wanted to electrify history,\u201d Castelbajac said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a mausoleum, it\u2019s a pop culture installation. Today\u2019s collectors buy a Napoleon artifact the way they\u2019d buy a guitar from Jimi Hendrix. They want a cabinet of curiosities.\u201d",

At the same time, families in Iran of five Radio Farda staff members have been pressured by people in the government who want to see the broadcasts stopped, she said.",
      "Through the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the Trump administration has sought to dismantle or sharply curtail the government-funded outlets that provide news reports to countries where there isn't a tradition of free press. The administration says these services operate with a liberal bias.",
      "Both Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are fighting the efforts in court.",
      "Employees at Voice of America's Persian service were notified in an email last Friday from Crystal Thomas, USAGM's human resources director, that they were being recalled and needed to report to work immediately.",
      "Kari Lake, who is running USAGM, told Fox News that \u201cwe are ramping up \u2014 as we've always planned to do \u2014 to meet this historic moment.\u201d",
      "One person who got that email was at the office within three hours and worked until midnight, helping to put out a one-hour broadcast, said the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak to the press. About 50 people have returned to work. Voice of America is banned in Iran, but many of its citizens find ways through the internet to bypass the ban.",
      "Voice of America's broadcasts \u2014 and social media posts \u2014 have become a challenge to produce because the administration has canceled subscriptions to news services like The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse, said a second employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the employees, it's a stressful time, putting out urgent news reports without any sense of how long \u2014 or whether \u2014 they will continue to have a job.",
      "\u201cI'm grateful they've brought back our Persian service to continue their role as a trusted voice covering the region for the Iranian people,\u201d said Patsy Widakuswara, VOA's White House correspondent, who is a plaintiff in the court fight to keep the agency alive.",
      "\u201cBut why smash a working system only to cobble it back together when you realize you need it?\u201d Widakuswara asked. \u201cAnd how many crises would it take for them to realize that all VOA language services are important \u2014 before, after and during breaking news?\u201d",
      "During video reports posted online this week, a Voice of America anchor explained where Iranian counterattacks were landing in Israel, and how Iranians were trying to send out information about what is happening through social media.",
      "The danger for a service like VOA, having been off the air and off social media for more than two months, is that Iranian citizens will become accustomed to looking elsewhere for news, said Tom Kent, a media consultant and former president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "\u201cYou would hope that people would learn from this that international broadcasting cannot be turned on and off like a light bulb,\u201d said Kent, also a former AP editor.",
      "Despite an Israeli airstrike on its headquarters Monday while the Republic of Iran News Network was broadcasting live, the state-run news service is still operating.",
      "Radio Farda has stayed on the air despite cutbacks. It also continues to have access to news services like the AP, but those contracts will expire at the end of the month, Esfandiani said. Three people have been brought back from furlough to help cover the war, she said.",
      "She said she hopes the conflict lets people who question the service's existence know its value.",
      "\u201cIt's an information war, absolutely,\u201d Esfandiani said. \u201cThese countries \u2014 Iran, Russia and China \u2014 would be very happy if we were gone.\u201d",
      "One of the VOA employees called back to work said they have not been told how long it will be for. Despite evidence this week that someone in the administration saw value in what they do, might they still lose their job eventually?",

      "Global efforts to protect children against diseases like measles, polio and tuberculosis have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to deadly infections",
      "LONDON -- Efforts to vaccinate children globally have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to tetanus, polio, tuberculosis and other diseases that can be easily prevented.",
      "Protection from measles in particular dropped in 100 countries between 2010 and 2019, unravelling decades of progress, including in rich countries that had previously eliminated the highly infectious disease, according to a new analysis of global vaccination trends published Tuesday in the journal Lancet.",
      "\u201cAfter clean water, vaccination is the most effective intervention for protecting the health of our children,\u201d said Helen Bedford, a professor of children's health at University College London, who was not connected to the research. She warned there has been a small but worrying rise in the number of parents skipping vaccination for their children in recent years, for reasons including misinformation.",
      "In Britain, Bedford said that has resulted in the largest number of measles recorded since the 1990s and the deaths of nearly a dozen babies from whooping cough. Vaccination rates in the U.S. are also falling, and exemptions from vaccinations are at an all-time high.",
      "After the World Health Organization established its routine immunization program in 1974, countries made significant efforts to protect children against preventable and sometimes fatal diseases; the program is credited with inoculating more than 4 billion children, saving the lives of 154 million worldwide.",
      "Since the program began, the global coverage of children receiving three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine nearly doubled, from 40% to 81%. The percentage of kids getting the measles vaccine also jumped from 37% to 83%, with similar increases for polio and tuberculosis.",
      "But after the COVID-19 pandemic, coverage rates dropped, with an estimated 15.6 million children missing out on the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine and the measles vaccine. Nearly 16 million children failed to get vaccinated against polio and 9 million missed out on the TB vaccine, with the biggest impact in sub-Saharan Africa. The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.",
      "Researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who conducted the analysis, noted that more than half of the world\u2019s 15.7 million unvaccinated children live in just eight countries in 2023: Nigeria, India, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Indonesia and Brazil.",
      "Since President Trump has begun to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO and dismantled the U.S Agency for International Aid, public health experts have warned of new epidemics of infectious diseases. The researchers said it was too early to know what impact recent funding cuts might have on children's immunization rates.",
      "The WHO said there had been an 11-fold spike in measles in the Americas this year compared to 2024. Measles infections doubled in the European region in 2024 versus the previous year and the disease remains common in Africa and Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cIt is in everyone's interest that this situation is rectified,\u201d said Dr. David Elliman, a pediatrician who has advised the British government, in a statement. \u201cWhile vaccine-preventable infectious diseases occur anywhere in the world, we are all at risk.\u201d",

      "A Texas law promoting the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on certain foods like chips and candies",
      "DALLAS -- A new Texas law promoting the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on foods like chips and candies that contain dyes and additives not allowed in other countries.",
      "It could have far-reaching effects on the nation's food supply, but a review of the legislation shows it also misrepresents the status of some ingredients that would trigger the action.",
      "The law signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday requires foods made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives to have labels starting in 2027 saying they contain ingredients \u201cnot recommended for human consumption\u201d in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K. But a review shows that nearly a dozen of the targeted additives are either authorized in the cited regions \u2014 or already restricted in the U.S.",
      "The law, which will send the food industry scrambling to respond, is laudable in its intent, but could lead to incorrect citations and potential legal challenges, a consumer advocacy group said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the list of chemicals was constructed,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cWarnings have to be accurate in order to be legal.\u201d",
      "The law, approved with wide bipartisan support, is part of a flurry of similar legislation this year by GOP-led statehouses as lawmakers align themselves with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda. Texas would be the first in the U.S. to use warning labels to target additives, rather than nutrients like sugar or saturated fat, to change American diets.",
      "It will force food companies to decide whether to reformulate products to avoid the labels, add the newly required language, pull certain products from Texas shelves or oppose the measure in court.",
      "It's unclear how the list of additives was created. Inquiries to the office of the bill's author, Republican state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, were not immediately returned.",
      "Regulators in Australia, Canada, the EU and the U.K. take a cautious approach to food additives: If a product's safety is uncertain, it can be banned or restricted until it is determined to be safe. By contrast, the U.S. generally allows products on the market unless there is clear risk of harm.",
      "Three additives targeted by Texas \u2014 partially hydrogenated oils, Red Dye No. 4 and Red Dye No. 3 \u2014 are not approved or have been banned in food by U.S. regulators.",
      "Several of the other listed ingredients are allowed in all four of those regions, noted Galligan and representatives from the Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group.",
      "Examples of those include: Blue Dye No. 1; Blue Dye No. 2; butylated hydroxyanisole, or BHA; butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT; diacetyl; interesterified soybean oil; lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol; and potassium aluminum sulfate.",
      "In addition, the legislation contains regulatory loopholes that could prevent certain ingredients from being labeled at all, said Melanie Benesh, an analyst with the Environmental Working Group, an activist organization that focuses on toxic chemicals.",
      "For example, the food additive azodicarbonamide, known as ADA and used as a bleaching agent in cereal flours, is included on the Texas list. But under the Federal Code of Regulations, it may safely be used in food under certain conditions. That federal regulation likely exempts ADA from the state labeling law, Benesh said.",
      "\u201cThe law, as passed, may not end up having the impact that legislators intended,\u201d Benesh said.",
      "Nutrition experts have long worried about the potential health effects of food additives, even as it remains unclear how much of a role processed foods have in driving chronic health disease.",
      "Research has shown that requiring food label warnings can help steer consumers toward healthier choices and prompt industry to remove concerning ingredients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has proposed front-of-package labels that would flag levels of saturated fat, sugar and sodium.",
      "\u201cThis represents a big win for Texas consumers and consumers overall,\u201d said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of states not wanting to wait for the federal government to act.\u201d",
      "The law also creates a state nutrition advisory committee, boosts physical education and nutrition curriculum requirements in public and charter schools, and requires nutrition courses for college students and medical professionals doing continuing education.",
      "Several states have been taking action to restrict dyes and additives in foods.",
      "In 2023, California became the first state to ban some chemicals and dyes used in candies, drinks and other foods because of health concerns. The state expanded on that last year by barring several additional dyes from food served in public schools.",
      "Other laws passed this year include one in Arkansas banning two particular additives from food sold or manufactured in the state and a West Virginia law includes a statewide ban on seven dyes.",
      "Lawmakers in several states have passed measures this year banning certain additives from food served or sold at public schools, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural. That includes Texas, where the governor last month signed a bill banning foods with certain ingredients from being served in school lunches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dizzying time to be watching what\u2019s happening, because usually policies that are not very industry friendly are opposed, particularly in red states,\" said Christina Roberto, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, \u201cWith RFK and the MAHA movement, it\u2019s really turned things upside-down in some ways.\u201d",
      "At the federal level, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary have pledged to remove artificial dyes from foods and have pressured industry to take voluntary action. Some large food manufacturers have complied.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",

      "NEW YORK -- An intense and nearly historic weather pattern is cooking much of America under a dangerous heat dome this week with triple-digit temperatures in places that haven't been so hot in more than a decade.",
      "The heat wave is especially threatening because it's hitting cities like Boston, New York and Philadelphia early in the summer when people haven't gotten their bodies adapted to the broiling conditions, several meteorologists said. The dome of high pressure that's parking over the eastern United States is trapping hot air from the Southwest that already made an uncomfortable stop in the Midwest.",
      "A key measurement of the strength of the high pressure broke a record Monday and was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a \u201cnear historic\u201d heat wave, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist. The worst of the heat was likely to peak for Northeastern cities on Tuesday, forecasters said.",
      "\u201cLike an air fryer, it\u2019s going to be hot,\" Maue said. \u201dThis is a three-day stretch of dangerous heat that will test the mettle of city dwellers who are most vulnerable to oppressive heat waves.\u201d",
      "A heat dome occurs when a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a reservoir, trapping heat and humidity. A heat wave is the persistence of heat, usually three days or more, with unusually hot temperatures.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the country's population \u2014 245 million people \u2014 will swelter with 90 degrees Fahrenheit (about 32 Celsius) or higher temperatures on Monday, and 33 million people, almost 10% of the country, will feel blistering 100-degree heat (about 38 Celsius) on Tuesday, Maue said. The government's heat health website showed the highest level of heat risk in swaths from Chicago to Pittsburgh and North Carolina to New York.",
      "Those triple-digit air temperatures \u2014 with the feels-like index even worse because of humidity \u2014 are possible in places where it\u2019s unusual. New York hasn\u2019t seen 100 degrees since 2011 and Philadelphia, which is forecast to have consecutive triple-digit days, hasn\u2019t reached that mark since 2012, said Climate Central chief meteorologist Bernadette Woods Placky.",
      "In downtown Baltimore, temperatures climbed into the high 90s by early Monday afternoon, bringing dozens of people to cool off at St. Vincent de Paul's resource center. A few blocks away, the city's historic Broadway Market food hall closed early when the building's air conditioning broke.",
      "The heat forced the cancellation of events in west Baltimore, said Eric Davis Sr., who spends most of his days working at a baseball field there.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have kids getting heat stroke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too hot today.\u201c",
      "NOAA meteorologist David Roth said it takes time to acclimate to summer heat and this heat dome could be a shock for some.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said.",
      "The heat is part of Earth's long-term warming. Summers in the United States are 2.4 degrees (1.3 degrees Celsius) hotter than 50 years ago, according to NOAA data. Human-caused climate change has made this heat wave three times more likely than without the burning of coal, oil and gas, the climate science nonprofit Climate Central calculated, using computer simulations comparing the current weather to a fictional world without the industrial greenhouse gases.",
      "A key question is how much humidity will add to the discomfort and danger of the heat.",
      "Maue is forecasting dry air which may be a degree or two or three hotter than predicted by NOAA, but more comfortable. Other meteorologists expected worse: Sticky, humid and even more dangerous.",
      "\"The \u2018big deal' will be with the humidity being provided with the wet late spring conditions,\" said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. \u201cThe area of high pressure will allow for a lot of evaporation to occur from the wet grounds locally and regionally, which will increase the heat indices quite a bit.\u201d",
      "Woods Placky said to expect dew points, a key measure of humidity, in the 70s. That's downright tropical, with some places approaching a dew point of 80 \u2014 a level Woods Placky said feels like \u201cyou\u2019re in a swimming pool\u201d and \u201cthe atmosphere is absorbing you.\u201d",
      "If this heat were later in the summer, it might not be as dangerous because the human body can adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, but this one is coming within days of the solstice, Woods Placky and others said.",

The study also found that insurers denied about 6% of all requests.",
      "Dr. Ashley Sumrall of Charlotte, North Carolina, says she has seen an increase in prior authorizations required for routine exams like MRIs. An oncologist who treats brain tumors, Sumrall said these images are critical for doctors to determine whether a treatment is working and to plan next steps.",
      "Doctors say delays from requests that are eventually approved or coverage rejections can harm patients by giving a disease time to progress untreated. They also can spike anxiety in patients who want to know whether their tumor has stopped growing and if insurance will cover the scan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a term that we use called \u2018scanxiety,\u2019 and it\u2019s very real,\u201d said Sumrall, a member of the Association for Clinical Oncology\u2019s volunteer leadership.",
      "Different forms and varied prior authorization policies also complicate the process. Sumrall noted that every insurer \u201chas their own way of doing business.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years, the companies have been unwilling to compromise, so I think any step in the direction of standardization is encouraging,\u201d she said.",

      "A new report finds that the number of abortions in the U.S. grew in 2024 as more women obtained pills through telehealth",
      "The number of abortions in the U.S. rose again in 2024, with women continuing to find ways to get them despite bans and restrictions in many states, according to a report out Monday.",
      "The latest report from the WeCount project of the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access, was released a day before the third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended nearly 50 years of legal abortion nationally for most of pregnancy.",
      "Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they are pregnant.",
      "While the total number of abortions has risen gradually over those three years, the number has dropped to near zero in some states, while abortions using pills obtained through telehealth appointments have become more common in nearly all states.",
      "Pills are used in the majority of abortions and are also prescribed in person.",
      "The latest survey, released Monday, tallied about 1.1 million abortions nationally last year, or about 95,000 a month. That is up from about 88,000 monthly in 2023 and 80,000 a month between April and December of 2022. WeCount began after Roe was overturned, and the 2022 numbers don't include January through March, when abortions are traditionally at their highest.",
      "The number is still well below the historic peak in the U.S. of nearly 1.6 million a year in the late 1990s.",
      "The Society of Family Planning relies primarily on surveys of abortion providers and uses estimates.",
      "WeCount found that in the months before the Dobbs ruling was handed down, about 1 in 20 abortions was accessed by telehealth.",
      "But during the last three months of 2024, it was up to 1 in 4.",
      "The biggest jump over that time came in the middle of 2023, when laws in some Democratic-controlled states took effect with provisions intended to protect medical professionals who use telehealth to prescribe pills to patients in states where abortion is banned or where there are laws restricting telehealth abortion.",
      "WeCount found that about half of the telehealth abortions last year were facilitated by the shield laws. The number of telehealth abortions also grew for those in states without bans.",
      "WeCount is the only nationwide public source of information about the pills prescribed to women in states with bans. One key caveat is that it is not clear how many of the prescriptions result in abortion. Some women may change their minds, access in-person abortion or be seeking pills to save for future use.",
      "The WeCount data could help explain data from a separate survey from the Guttmacher Institute, which found the number of people crossing state lines for abortion declined last year.",
      "Anti-abortion efforts are zeroing in on pills, along with barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood and undoing ballot measures that provided for abortion access.",
      "Three states have sued to try to get courts to limit telehealth prescriptions of mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions. President Donald Trump's administration last month told a judge it does not believe the states have legal standing to make that case.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court last year found that anti-abortion doctors and their organizations didn't have standing, either.",
      "Meanwhile, officials in Louisiana are using criminal laws, and there is an effort in Texas to use civil penalties against a New York doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to women in their states. Louisiana lawmakers have also sent the governor a bill to further restrict access to the pills.",
      "SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said on a call with reporters Monday that it's a priority for her group to keep pushing U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other officials to investigate the safety of abortion pills \u2014 and to require that they be dispensed only in person.",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Gov. Greg Abbott vetoed a bill Sunday to ban all THC consumables, allowing the booming market flush with THC-infused vapes, gummies and other products to continue to be sold across the state.",
      "Abbott, a Republican, waited until the final moment to veto the bill in what would have been one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country and a significant blow to the state's billion-dollar industry.",
      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",
      "Loopholes in existing law have allowed many THC-infused goods to enter the market across the country, including states with strict marijuana laws.",
      "Texas has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country, prohibiting all recreational use and providing a limited medical marijuana program. The consumables market has allowed residents to legally access goods giving a similar high to marijuana.",
      "Republican lawmakers have criticized the products as dangerous due to a lack of federal oversight in how the goods are manufactured. Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",
      "Critics of the Texas bill say it allows people who cannot access marijuana through the state's medical marijuana program to acquire goods that can provide a similar relief. Many retailers across the state also pointed to the thousands of jobs and millions in revenue the industry brings each year.",
      "Last year, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed a bill that would have put age restrictions on THC consumables, claiming it would hurt small businesses.",

    "story": [
      "Everyone needs protein \u2014 it's vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of your muscles, bones and skin",
      "The human body needs protein. Proteins carry out countless functions inside cells and they are vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of muscles, bones and skin. And with food companies rolling out high-protein versions of a huge range of foods, including milkshakes and granola bars \u2014 and even pancakes and popcorn \u2014 you might be tempted to think you need to add more to your diet.",
      "But nutritionists say that if you are getting enough food, you are probably getting enough protein.",
      "\u201cAdding protein to foods is very beneficial \u2014 for the profits of that food,\u201d said Federica Amati, nutrition lead at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at the health science company ZOE. \u201cIt is not based on health, it is not backed by science.\u201d",
      "The amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and personal nutritional needs and it is especially important for children and older adults to make sure they eat protein-rich foods. Here\u2019s what to know about how much protein you need and how to ensure you're getting it from the best sources.",
      "Protein is a macronutrient, or a basic kind of food like fat or carbohydrates that your body needs to function. There are thousands of proteins, assembled from smaller molecules called amino acids \u2014 most of which can be made by the body.",
      "\u201cBecause protein is so important, our body has adapted really well to making sure that it can reassemble and change the building blocks of these amino acids to make sure we have what we need, as long as we\u2019re eating adequate amounts of food,\u201d Amati said.",
      "Still, the body can't make all the amino acids, so some must come from food.",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that healthy adults get about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight (0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight). That's roughly 60 grams for men and 50 grams for women per day, based on body weights of 165 pounds (75 kilograms) for men and 143 pounds (65 kilograms) for women.",
      "In most rich countries, the average adult gets far more, Amati said. Protein deficiencies are mostly seen in malnourished people on subsistence diet in poorer countries, she said.",
      "Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist with the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was important to get protein from different foods, like dairy, fish, beans, nuts, vegetables and meat. She said studies suggest vegetarians and vegans have lower protein intake than meat and fish eaters, but that their average protein levels are still OK.",
      "Having some protein at every meal is also a likely a good idea. \u201cIt appears to be better for preserving muscle function if you have some protein throughout the day, rather than just having it all in one meal,\u201d Benelam said.",
      "Plant-based sources of protein include foods such as beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and meat substitutes. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources of protein. Amati said that proteins from animal-based sources may be easier for the body to break down compared to plant-based proteins, which tend to have more fiber.",
      "\u201cIf you eat a piece of beef, you\u2019re getting protein and things like zinc and iron, but you\u2019re also getting more saturated fat,\u201d she said. In comparison, Amati said eating protein-rich foods like chickpeas or beans also provides the body with fiber, something that's lacking in most of our diets.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a specific health issue that requires you to have more protein, most people in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. do not need more,\u201d said Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation.",
      "Amati, of Imperial College London, said people should scrutinize the ingredient list of protein-enriched products to make sure they aren\u2019t loaded with sugar and fat.",
      "For people trying to build more muscle, she recommended a more direct solution: exercise.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your body composition and muscle strength, you have to lift (heavier) weights and give your body a challenge,\u201d Amati said. \u201cEating a protein bar is not going to help.\u201d",

      "Bicycles have long been ubiquitous, and many families tend to have one. Cultural norms in northern Uganda don\u2019t prohibit women from riding. While the roads in Lira town are paved, dirt paths lead into the heart of the district where farming is the main economic activity.",

      "A Brazilian woman who says she became pregnant after being raped in March should have been granted access to a legal abortion",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- A 27-year-old Brazilian woman, who said she became pregnant after being raped in March during Carnival in Brasilia, should have been granted access to a legal abortion. But when she sought to terminate the pregnancy at a hospital around a month later, she was told she needed a police report to access the service, despite it not being a legal requirement.",
      "She decided to abort at home with medication she bought on the black market, with only a few friends on site to help.",
      "\u201cI fainted several times because of the pain. I was terrified I was going to die,\u201d she said.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted.",
      "In Brazil, abortion is legally restricted to cases of rape, life-threatening risks to the pregnant woman or if the fetus has no functioning brain. Theoretically, when a pregnancy results from sexual violence, the victim\u2019s word should suffice for access to the procedure.",
      "\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t require judicial authorization or anything like that,\u201d explained Ivanilda Figueiredo, a professor of law at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cA woman seeking an abortion recounts the situation to a multi-disciplinary team at the healthcare clinic and, in theory, that should be enough.\u201d",
      "In practice, however, advocates, activists and health experts say women encounter significant barriers to ending a pregnancy even under the limited conditions provided for by the law. This is due to factors including lack of facilities, disparities between clinic protocols and even resistance from medical personnel.",
      "\u201cHealthcare professionals, citing religious or moral convictions, often refuse to provide legal abortions, even when working in clinics authorized to perform them,\u201d said Carla de Castro Gomes, a sociologist who studies abortion and associate researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Women in Brazil also face geographical barriers to legal abortions. Only 290 facilities in a mere 3.6% of municipalities around the country of approximately 213 million people provide the service, according to a 2021 study from scientific journal Reports in Public Health.",
      "In June 2022, four nonprofits filed a legal challenge with the Supreme Court, arguing that restrictions on abortion access violate women\u2019s constitutional rights. The case is currently under review.",
      "A 35-year-old cashier from a small city in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state also said she became pregnant as a result of a rape. But, unlike the woman in Brasilia, she chose to pursue an abortion through legal means, fearing the risks that come with a clandestine procedure.",
      "Although Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry mandates that, in the case of a pregnancy resulting from rape, healthcare professionals must present women with their rights and support them in their decision, the woman said a hospital committee refused to terminate the pregnancy. They claimed she was too far along, despite Brazilian law not stipulating a time limit for such procedures.",
      "She eventually found help through the Sao Paulo-based Women Alive Project, a nonprofit specializing in helping victims of sexual violence access legal abortions. The organization helped her locate a hospital in another state, an 18-hour drive, willing to carry out the procedure.",
      "Thanks to a fundraising campaign, the woman was able to travel and undergo the operation at 30 weeks of pregnancy in late April.",
      "\u201cWe are already victims of violence and are forced to suffer even more,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a right guaranteed by law, but unfortunately still seen as taboo.\u201d",
      "Brazil\u2019s abortion laws are among the most constrictive in Latin America, where several countries \u2014 including Mexico, Argentina and Colombia \u2014 have enacted sweeping reforms to legalize or broadly decriminalize abortion.",
      "This legislative environment is exacerbated by a political landscape in which far-right politicians, supported by Catholic and Evangelical voters who make up a majority in the country, regularly seek to further restrict the limited provisions within the country's penal code.",
      "In 2020, the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro issued an ordinance requiring doctors to report rape victims seeking abortions to the police. Current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva revoked the measure in his first month in office in 2023.",
      "But the measure left lasting effects.",
      "\u201cThese changes end up generating a lot of legal uncertainty among health professionals, who fear prosecution for performing legal abortions,\u201d Castro Gomes said.",
      "Last year, conservative lawmaker S\u00f3stenes Cavalcante proposed a bill to equate the termination of a pregnancy after 22 weeks with homicide, sparking widespread protests by feminist groups across Brazil. The protests ultimately led to the proposal being shelved.",
      "But in November, a committee of the Chamber of Deputies approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would effectively outlaw all abortions by determining the \u201cinviolability of the right to life from conception.\u201d The bill is currently on hold, awaiting the formation of a commission.",
      "Earlier this month, Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, a Lula ally, came under fire after sanctioning a bill mandating anti-abortion messages on posters in municipal hospitals and other health establishments.",
      "Advocates say access to abortion highlights significant disparities: women with financial means dodge legal restrictions by traveling abroad for the procedure, while children, poor women and Black women face greater obstacles.",
      "According to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety, 61.6% of the 83,988 rape victims in 2023 were under the age of 14. A statistical analysis that year by investigative outlet The Intercept estimated less than 4% of girls aged 10 to 14 who became pregnant as a result of rape accessed a legal abortion between 2015 and 2020.",
      "In Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Mare favela, one of the city\u2019s largest low-income communities, the nonprofit Networks of Mare\u2019s House of Women provides women with information regarding their reproductive rights, including legal provisions for abortions.",
      "It was there, during a recent workshop, that Karina Braga de Souza, a 41-year-old mother of five, found out abortion is legal in certain cases in Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have access (to information). Doctors don\u2019t tell you,\u201d she said.",
      "Feminist groups in Brazil are campaigning at a federal level for enhanced access to legal abortion services.",
      "Last year, \u201cA Child Is Not a Mother,\u201d a campaign by feminist groups, successfully advocated for the National Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents to adopt a resolution detailing how to handle cases of pregnant child rape victims. The body, jointly made up of government ministries and civil society organizations, approved the resolution by a slim majority in December.",
      "Brazilian activists also are seeking to improve access to abortion by forging links with organizations abroad.",
      "In May, members of feminist groups in Brazil including Neither in Prison, Nor Dead and Criola met with a delegation of mostly Black U.S. state legislators. The meeting, organized by the Washington, D.C.-based Women\u2019s Equality Center, aimed to foster collaboration on strategies to defend reproductive rights, especially in light of the U.S. Supreme Court 2022 decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion.",
      "In the meantime, the consequences for women who struggle to access their rights run deep.",
      "The woman in Brasilia who underwent an abortion at home said she is coping thanks to therapy and the support of other women, but has been traumatized by recent events.",
      "By being denied access to a legal abortion, \u201cour bodies feel much more pain than they should,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever I remember, I feel very angry.\u201d",

      "The U.K. government says China\u2019s attempts to spy, destabilize and disrupt Britain\u2019s economy and democracy have grown, but Beijing is still a vital economic partner",
      "LONDON -- China\u2019s attempts to spy, destabilize and disrupt Britain\u2019s economy and democracy have grown, but Beijing is still a vital economic partner for the U.K., the government said Tuesday.",
      "Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \u201cChina\u2019s power is an inescapable fact\u201d and freezing relations with the world\u2019s second biggest economy is \u201cnot an option.\u201d He spoke to lawmakers as he outlined findings from the government\u2019s \u201cChina audit.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina is our third biggest trading partner, our universities\u2019 second largest source of international students. China will continue to play a vital role in supporting the U.K.\u2019s secure growth,\u201d Lammy said.",
      "The Labour Party government pledged to conduct an in-depth examination of U.K.-China relations after it was elected almost a year ago, in an effort to balance the country's economic interests and its security. Many details of the review will remain classified for security reasons, Lammy said.",
      "Its conclusions were summarized in a document outlining the U.K. government\u2019s broader national security strategy. It said that \u201cinstances of China\u2019s espionage, interference in our democracy and the undermining of our economic security have increased in recent years.\u201d",
      "Yet the government resisted pressure from China hawks in Parliament to label China a threat on a par with Russia. The security review called it a \u201cgeostrategic challenge\u201d but also an essential player in tackling major issues such as climate change, global health and economic stability.",
      "\u201cWe will seek a trade and investment relationship that supports secure and resilient growth, and boosts the U.K. economy,\u201d the government said. \u201cYet there are several major areas, such as human rights and cybersecurity, where there are stark differences and where continued tension is likely.\u201d",
      "Opposition Conservative Party foreign affairs spokeswoman Priti Patel said the government was showing \u201csigns of naivety\u201d about China. Another Conservative lawmaker, Harriet Cross, branded Beijing \u201cat best unreliable and at worst hostile.\u201d",
      "U.K.-China relations have chilled since the short-lived \u201cgolden era\u201d announced by then-Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015, after a series of spying and cyberespionage allegations, Beijing\u2019s crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, a former British colony, and China\u2019s support for Russia in the Ukraine war.",
      "There was no immediate comment from China on the review.",
      "China was one of many challenges identified in a review that the government said marked \u201ca hardening and a sharpening of our approach to national security\u201d in an increasingly dangerous world.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s government has pledged, along with other NATO members, to increase spending on security to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035. The total includes 3.5% on defense and 1.5% on broader security and resilience.",
      "The U.K. currently spends 2.3% of national income on defense and says that will rise to 2.6% by 2027.",

      "The violence has displaced more than 600,000 people and spilled into neighboring provinces, according to the United Nations.",
      "Human Rights Watch said there had been a resurgence of attacks and child kidnappings in the last two months and called on Mozambique's government to do more to find the children and prevent further abductions.",
      "The problems in Cabo Delgado were largely overshadowed by Mozambique's deadly and long-running post-election protests last year. Cabo Delgado has also been battered by several recent cyclones and hurt by U.S. President Donald Trump's cuts to foreign aid.",
      "The Norwegian Refugee Council's Secretary General, Jan Egeland, visited Cabo Delgado this month and described the situation in northern Mozambique as a neglected crisis.",
      "\u201cClimate shocks, increasing violence and spiralling hunger are having a terrible impact on the population,\u201d Egeland said.",

      "Pope Leo XIV is kicking off a weeklong celebration of Catholic clergy for the Holy Year",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV kicked off a weeklong celebration of Catholic clergy Tuesday by encouraging seminarians to be joyful and honest, offering an uplifting message after Pope Francis frequently castigated priests and decried what he called the sin of \"clericalism.\u201d",
      "History's first American pope presided over a rollicking encounter with thousands of young men who were in Rome for a special Jubilee week celebrating seminarians, priests and bishops.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s encounter turned St. Peter\u2019s Basilica into something resembling a concert venue, with seminarians waving their national flags, interrupting Leo frequently with applause and shouts of \u201cPapa Leone\u201d and straining against barricades to kiss his ring as he passed.",
      "In his remarks, Leo thanked the seminarians for agreeing to devote their lives to the church and said that with their energy \u201cyou fuel the flame of hope in the life of the church.\u201d He urged them to be brave, joyful, truthful and not hide behind masks or live hypocritical lives.",
      "\"You also have to learn to give a name and voice to sadness, fear, anxiety and indignation, bringing everything before God,\u201d the Augustinian pope told them. \u201cCrises, limitations, fragilities aren\u2019t to be hidden, but are rather occasions for grace.\u201d",
      "Francis also frequently met with seminarians, priests and bishops. But he often had a message of tough love, railing against what he called clericalism, or the tendency to put priests and clergy on a pedestal. For Francis, clericalism was the root of many of the church\u2019s problems, especially the clergy sex abuse and cover-up scandal, given how he said it can contribute to abuses of power and authority.",
      "While offering a more positive message, Leo cited many of Francis\u2019 concerns in urging seminarians to accompany the poor and lamenting today's \u201cthrowaway culture.\u201d The seminarians interrupted him with applause when he cited Francis by name.",
      "The message of encouragement may also have been aimed at addressing the Catholic Church\u2019s chronic hemorrhaging of the number of clergy.",
      "According to the latest Vatican statistics, the number of seminarians worldwide continued to drop even as the Catholic population grew. There were 108,481 seminarians at the end of 2022, compared to 109,895 the previous year. Only Africa and Oceania registered increases and the church registered steep declines in the traditionally Catholic Americas and Europe, and a more modest decline in Asia.",
      "Over the coming days, Leo is expected to hold similar encounters with priests and bishops before presiding over a Jubilee Mass this weekend. This week marks something of the halfway mark of the Vatican\u2019s 2025 Holy Year, a celebration of Catholicism held once every quarter-century that has brought millions of pilgrims to Rome.",

It acted ahead of the NATO summit starting Tuesday that aims to raise allies' defense spending target from 2% of GDP to 3.5%, plus another 1.5% for potentially defense-related infrastructure.",

      "Klingbeil, who is also the vice chancellor, said he will \u201cbe very vigilant that the money is spent efficiently,\u201d for example by aiming for greater cooperation at European level on procurement, research and development.",

      "Johannes Hahn, the EU envoy for Cyprus, held his first meeting Tuesday with Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides in his new capacity, which officials hope will build momentum toward reviving stalled negotiations led by the United Nations.",
      "Cyprus was cleaved along ethnic lines in 1974 when Turkey invaded in the wake of a coup that aimed to unify the island with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a 1983 Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence in the island\u2019s northern third where Turkey maintains more than 35,000 troops.",

      "The allies are likely to endorse a goal of spending 5% of their gross domestic product on their security, to be able to fulfil the alliance\u2019s plans for defending against outside attack. Still, Spain has said it cannot, and that the target is \"unreasonable.\" President Donald Trump has said the U.S. should not have to.",
      "Slovakia said that it reserves the right to decide how to reach the target by NATO's new 2035 deadline.",
      "\u201cWe are not living in happy land after the Berlin Wall came down. We are living in much more dangerous times and there are enemies, adversaries who might want to attack us,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said ahead of the summit in The Hague.",

      "Ahead of the two-day meeting, Britain, France and Germany committed to the 5% goal. Host country the Netherlands is also onboard. Nations closer to the borders of Ukraine, Russia and its ally Belarus had previously pledged to do so.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a historic moment. It\u2019s probably one of the most consequential moments in this alliance\u2019s history,\" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said. \"We\u2019re going to see a renaissance of our defense industries.\u201d",

      "Zelenskyy\u2019s first official engagement was with Dutch caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof at his official residence just across the road from the summit venue.",
      "But in a telling sign of Ukraine\u2019s status at the summit, neither leader mentioned NATO. Ukraine\u2019s bid to join the alliance has been put in deep freeze by Trump.",
      "\u201cLet me be very clear, Ukraine is part of the family that we call the Euro-Atlantic family,\u201d Schoof told Zelenskyy, who in turn said he sees his country\u2019s future in peace \u201cand of course, a part of a big family of EU family.\u201d",

      "BRAKPAN, South Africa -- Themba Maseko quickly wipes oil and grease off his hands with a rag as he breaks away from repairing one car to assist another customer who needs parts for a low-riding BMW 325is that he\u2019s pulled up in, exhausts booming.",
      "As soon as Maseko returns beneath the hood of the first vehicle to continue his work, yet another man arrives desperately wanting his car to be looked at.",
      "\u201cIt gets hectic,\u201d said the 39-year-old mechanic, sweat plastering his face.",
      "The father of three runs a small motor repair shop in the township of Tsakane, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of South Africa\u2019s biggest city of Johannesburg. His hopes for his business to succeed when it\u2019s up against established urban car service and repair centers have been boosted by a new initiative started at the end of last year.",
      "Maseko has joined with other mechanics from townships to form a cooperative. Together, they now have combined purchasing power to ensure they can source official car spares and equipment for their shops and don\u2019t get cut out of the market. The Motor Spares Collective means they can place orders to an online spares shop through WhatsApp and authentic parts are usually delivered to them in 24 hours.",
      "That avoids what Maseko says is his biggest challenge: spending hours away from his garage queuing for parts, sometimes to find there aren\u2019t any in stock because they\u2019ve been bought up by larger chains.",
      "As one busy day at his shop showed, the customers are lining up for Maseko\u2019s services, he just needs the parts.",
      "\u201cNow with the collective it\u2019s much easier. I don\u2019t have to go stand in queue and waste time,\u201d said Maseko, who changed career from an electrician to a full-time mechanic in 2008. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s at a cheaper price.\u201d",
      "The Motor Spares Collective is one initiative designed to unlock the potential of small township businesses in South Africa, which the government has identified as key to driving growth and creating jobs in areas where unemployment and poverty are high.",
      "Various studies indicate that more than 21 million people in South Africa live in townships on the edge of major cities or towns \u2014 a third of the population \u2014 and they have a combined spending power of billions of dollars and generally prefer local businesses.",
      "South Africa has over 700,000 registered small businesses. In the townships these include hair salons, taverns, car repair shops, laundromats and others sometimes operating out of people\u2019s homes. According to a report by financial services group Lesaka, South Africa\u2019s informal sector generates an estimated $33 billion in revenue, or more than 6% of GDP.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t respect the trade in the townships,\u201d said Sharief Bartus, another member of the motor spares collective.",
      "For a $10 monthly membership fee for the first year, Maseko and the others get more than just access to car parts and tools for their garages. The collective also offers skills development opportunities, help with business registration and financing.",
      "\u201cThe more members we get, the more discounts we get, the more work we have,\u201d said Dorian Slimmerts, another mechanic in the collective who is operating not far from Maseko.",
      "Township mechanics offering a local option for car owners have long battled on the fringes of the country\u2019s commercial auto manufacturing and repair sector. A regulation change in 2020 also made a big difference. New \u201cright to repair\u201d rules in South Africa mean car owners can now have their vehicles serviced by registered independent mechanics and not lose their warranties.",
      "That\u2019s opened the door a little more for township mechanics.",
      "Car maintenance is especially needed in South Africa, where there are around 12 million automobiles on the road and people are keeping their cars longer. The demand for affordable pre-owned cars has outpaced new cars since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Time is the critical element for township mechanics, though. Their businesses see lots of walk-in clients, prices are often negotiated and customers expect quick service \u2014 or they will look elsewhere.",
      "\u201cAll the mechanic sells is time,\u201d said Amanda Gcabashe, managing director of UBU Investment Holdings, an economic advisory company that helped set up the cooperative. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we came with this to say, how do we make sure that we then solve that pain point by making spares easily accessible?\u201d",
      "She said that as well as the business help, the collective is also looking to offer life insurance packages and other social safety net services for its mechanics.",

      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian lawmakers voted Monday decisively in favor of a new pro-European coalition government led by a center-right prime minister, as the European Union and NATO member nation seeks to end one of its worst political crises in its post-communist history.",
      "Parliament approved the new administration in a 301-9 vote in Romania\u2019s 464-seat legislature, days after Romania's new President Nicusor Dan nominated Ilie Bolojan of the center-right National Liberal Party, or PNL, to lead a new government. Some lawmakers from nationalist opposition parties were absent from the voting.",
      "The coalition is made up of the leftist Social Democratic Party, or PSD, the PNL, the reformist Save Romania Union party, and the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party, with the support of national minorities. The ministerial positions will be shared among the parties, which will hold a comfortable majority. The prime ministerial position will be rotated in 2027 from Bolojan to a PSD premier as part of a power-sharing agreement.",
      "Ahead of the confidence vote on Monday, Bolojan, 56, called it a \u201cdecisive moment\" for Romania's future and said among his top priorities would be reducing the large budget deficit and reforming state institutions.",
      "\u201cDespite the challenges we face \u2026 Romania deserves a realistic and fair country project,\u201d he said. \u201cRomania must be stronger and more secure, with an economy that can and must grow \u2026 with reformed institutions and respect for citizens.\u201d",
      "With one of the highest budget deficits in the 27-nation EU bloc, the new government will face the challenge of introducing fiscal measures that Bolojan acknowledged could prove unpopular, especially ahead of a 2028 general election amid a growing shift toward populist parties.",
      "After parliament\u2019s approval, the Romanian president held a ceremony to swear in the new government at Cotroceni Palace in the capital, Bucharest.",
      "\u201cToday we begin a new chapter,\u201d President Dan said. \u201cWe must rebuild citizens\u2019 trust in the authorities of the Romanian state. It will be a long road, but I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll succeed.\u201d",
      "Bolojan previously served as acting president earlier this year, until Dan decisively beat a hard-right opponent in a heated presidential election rerun. That vote was held months after the previous election was annulled by a top court, which plunged Romania into a deep political crisis and exposed deep societal divisions in the country.",
      "The previous coalition, sworn in last December, collapsed following Marcel Ciolacu\u2019s resignation in May, after the joint candidate failed to make the presidential runoff.",
      "The current broad coalition is viewed as a tactical partnership to shut out right-wing nationalists, whose voices found fertile ground during Romania\u2019s chaotic election cycle, with growing anti-establishment sentiment.",
      "Sorin Grindeanu, the PSD leader, said his party \u201cwill be a responsible and honest partner\u201d in the new coalition, which he said is for \u201cthe good of this country and for the good of Romanians.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wish (the coalition) to be strong for the next three and a half years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are thus leaving the era of unprofitable interims and entering a period of rational and realistic solutions.\u201d",
      "George Simion, the leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, who lost the presidency to Dan in the runoff, said he didn\u2019t think the coalition would make it through the year.",

      "\u201cYou will see important language about Ukraine, including connecting the defense spending up to 2035 to Ukraine, and the need for Ukraine to stay in the fight,\u201d Rutte told reporters on the eve of the two-day summit. \u201cThis is a clear commitment by allies.\u201d",
      "But the Ukrainian leader hasn't yet publicly confirmed he'll attend a dinner laid on for leaders attending the NATO summit, where his country has had a diplomatic downgrade from previous alliance meetings, even as leaders stress that their militaries need to muscle up to counter the threat of Russia.",
      "It's a big change since the summit in Washington last year, when the military alliance\u2019s weighty communique included a vow to supply long-term security assistance to Ukraine, and a commitment to back the country \u201con its irreversible path\u201d to NATO membership.",
      "But with Zelenskyy\u2019s relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump still strained since a testy Oval Office meeting earlier this year, finding a place for the Ukrainian leader at NATO\u2019s top table has proved a bridge too far.",
      "There are other meetings scheduled for Zelenskyy at the summit, but the doors remain shut to the leaders' working meeting Wednesday, even as Rutte acknowledged how heavily the war weighs on the leaders.",
      "\u201cOf course, the most significant and direct threat facing this alliance remains the Russian Federation,\" he said. \"Moscow continues to wage war against Ukraine with the support of North Korea, Iran and China, as well as Belarus.\u201d",
      "Rutte stressed that the alliance is underwriting Ukraine\u2019s defense to the tune of billions of euros.",
      "European allies and Canada, \u201cwill provide over \u20ac35 billion of additional security assistance to Ukraine for the year ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in a couple of months, we went from \u20ac20 billion to \u20ac35 billion. And I think that is great news.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Moscow bombarded Ukraine with 352 drones and decoys, as well as 11 ballistic missiles and five cruise missiles overnight Monday, Ukraine\u2019s air force said, killing at least 14 people and injuring several dozen others.",

      "Louisiana accused pharmaceutical giant CVS of using its dominant market position to abuse customer information, drive up drug costs and unfairly undermine independent pharmacies",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Louisiana filed several lawsuits accusing pharmaceutical giant CVS of abusing customer information and using its dominant market position to drive up drug costs and unfairly undermine independent pharmacies, the state\u2019s attorney general said Tuesday.",
      "Attorney General Liz Murrill began investigating CVS after the company sent out mass text messages to thousands of residents on June 11 to lobby against legislation that took aim at its business structure. The texts warned that medication costs could go up and all CVS pharmacies in the state would close.",
      "The lawsuits, which were filed Monday in central Louisiana\u2019s St. Landry Parish, seek \u201cinjunctive relief, civil penalties and restitution,\" Murrill said.",
      "CVS \u201cabused customers\u2019 sensitive information to push a political message,\u201d Republican Gov. Jeff Landry said Tuesday at a press conference.",
      "He noted CVS had lobbied his wife over text via the same messaging chain normally used to notify her about picking up a prescription drug or other healthcare-related matters.",
      "One lawsuit argues that the text message lobbying constituted \u201cunfair or deceptive acts\" in violation of state trade law.",
      "CVS has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cOur communication with CVS customers, patients and members of the community was consistent with the law,\u201d CVS said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe believe it was important for people to know about a potential disruption to where they get their medicine.\u201d",
      "Two other lawsuits allege that CVS artificially inflates prices for consumers and independent pharmacies.",
      "CVS serves as a pharmacy benefit manager \u2014 essentially an intermediary that buys medication from manufacturers and distributes drugs to pharmacies.",
      "CVS and the mail-order pharmacy Express Scripts dominate the market by processing about eight out of every 10 prescription drug claims, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which warned in a 2024 report that this allows for \u201cinflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies.\"",
      "Because CVS also owns a vast network of retail pharmacies \u2014 including 119 in Louisiana \u2014 it sets the terms for how prescription drugs are sold to customers there.",
      "The proposed law that sparked the text messages from CVS had sought to ban pharmacy benefit managers like CVS from owning drug stores. The law failed to pass, but Landry has stated he will seek to revive it.",
      "In the state's litigation, Murrill alleges that CVS business structure and practices allow the company to \u201cmanipulate prices, restrict competition and channel profits internally.\"",
      "One lawsuit accuses CVS of \u201csystematically under-reimbursing independent Louisiana pharmacies to the point of economic hardship, while routing patients to CVS-owned facilities.\u201d The lawsuit alleges that CVS imposes \u201cunethical, unscrupulous, and exorbitantly high fees on independent pharmacies.\u201d",
      "CVS said that it should not have to pay higher rates for \u201cless efficient pharmacies\u201d and that this would lead to \u201chigher costs for consumers.\u201d",
      "\u201cImportantly, CVS Pharmacy remains the lowest cost pharmacy and a critical partner in lowering prescription drug costs for Louisianans,\u201d the company said.",
      "Another lawsuit argues that CVS uses its market control to exclude lower-cost drugs for \"high-rebate, high-price brand drugs\u201d and other practices that \u201cdistort the drug market\u201d and \u201cdrive up costs for the state's public health programs and its citizens.\u201d",
      "CVS said that its business structure allows for \u201cbetter access, affordability, and advocacy for those we serve.\u201d The company said that removing CVS pharmacies from Louisiana would increase costs to the state by more than $4.6 million.",
      "Landry said he would seek new legislation targeting CVS if existing laws were insufficient to win in court.",

      "Attorneys for 12 of NASCAR\u2019s 15 race teams told a federal judge that disclosing their financial records to the stock car series would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d to competitive balance",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Attorneys for 12 of NASCAR's 15 race teams argued in federal court Tuesday that disclosing their financial records to the stock car series would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d to competitive balance and warned that making such details public would put them all in danger.",
      "The hearing was over a discovery dispute between NASCAR and the teams that are not parties in the ongoing antitrust suit filed by 23XI Racing, which is owned by retired NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Front Row Motorsports, owned by entrepreneur Bob Jenkins.",
      "23XI and Front Row are the only two organizations out of the 15 that refused last September to sign take-it-or-leave offers on a new charter agreement. Charters are NASCAR\u2019s version of a franchise model, with each charter guaranteeing entry to the lucrative Cup Series races and a stable revenue stream. Of the 13 teams that signed, only Kaulig Racing has submitted the financial documents NASCAR subpoenaed as part of discovery.",
      "The other 12 organizations are fighting against releasing the information to NASCAR and even argued that NASCAR asking for them violates the charter agreement, which claims all disputes must go to arbitration.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kenneth Bell of the Western District of North Carolina promised a quick ruling but, just like last week, seemed exasperated at the lengths being taken in this brawl that for now is heading toward a December trial.",
      "\u201cI am amazed at the effort going into burning this house down over everybody's heads,\u201d Bell said at the end of the nearly two-hour hearing. \u201cBut I'm the fire marshal and I will be here in December if need be.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for the teams say their financial records are private and there is no guarantee the information won't be leaked; in a hearing last week, information learned in discovery was disclosed in open court.",
      "\u201cIt would be absolutely devastating to these race teams if their competitors were able to find out sponsorships on the cars, driver salaries and all revenue streams,\u201d attorney Adam Ross said. \u201cIt cannot make its way into the public realm.\u201d",
      "Ross said NASCAR has asked for 11 years of records and communications \u2014 including what Hendrick Motorsports spent on both its Garage 56 project building a car to race at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the cost of Kyle Larson running both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 the last two seasons.",
      "\u201cNASCAR has gone a step too far,\u201d Ross said.",
      "NASCAR argued it needs the financials to understand profit margins and whether teams are actually unable to make ends meet under the charter agreement. NASCAR vowed to redact details to conceal team identities, a suggestion that was met with skepticism from team attorneys who contended it would be easy to connect the dots and, for example, figure out which contracts belong to, say, Team Penske.",
      "Attorneys also argued that money is not often distributed equally across the board with each team. For example, Team Penske might use an engineer for a NASCAR team, an IndyCar team and a sports car team.",
      "Bell asked NASCAR why it would not be satisfied with just \u201ctopline\u201d numbers.",
      "\u201cWhy is not enough to know it costs X to run a car?\u201d Bell asked.",
      "Attorneys for the 12 teams also noted that their clients are extremely uncomfortable to be dragged into the suit.",
      "\u201cThis is the opposite of what they want \u2014 all the teams are torn to pieces that NASCAR wants them to disclose this information and they don't want to upset NASCAR,\u201d Ross said.",
      "Teams have long argued that NASCAR is not financially viable and they needed multiple concessions, including a greater revenue stream and a more permanent length on the charter agreements. Those presently have expiration dates and can be revoked by NASCAR. Two years of negotiations ended last fall with 13 teams signing on but 23IX and FRM instead heading to court.",
      "The hearing came one day after Bell declined to dismiss the teams\u2019 request to toss out NASCAR\u2019s countersuit, which accuses Jordan business manager Curtis Polk of using \u201ccartel\u201d-type tactics in the most recent round of charter negotiations.",

      "You just retired (or are about to)",
      "If there\u2019s a single group of people who are likely to be experiencing the most consternation over recent market events, it\u2019s those who have just retired or who are on the cusp of hanging it up.",
      "But as with most things in life, the key for new- and near-retirees making it through this period with their sanity intact is to focus on what they can control.",
      "People who have just retired or are about to do so are vulnerable to sequence-of-returns risk, which means that a bad market shows up early in retirement. And this imperils your portfolio\u2019s ability to last throughout your retirement years.",
      "Retirees who are pulling cash flows from their portfolios can address that risk by adjusting spending down to ensure that more of their portfolios are in place to recover when the market eventually does.",
      "In our retirement income research, we found that tweaks like forgoing an inflation adjustment following a bear market help ensure that spending lasts over a 30-year period.",
      "If you haven\u2019t yet retired, assess your planned in-retirement spending and identify where you could make cutbacks if needed.",
      "Ideally, you can pull portfolio cash flows from safer assets and leave your stock positions undisturbed.",
      "That\u2019s the general logic behind the Bucket approach to portfolio construction. In good years for the stock market, harvest appreciated equity assets for income. In bad ones, don\u2019t touch stocks but instead source cash flows from high-quality bonds or cash.",
      "Using that logic, you may even want to reinvest income distributions back into securities that have recently lost value rather than spending them.",
      "If pulling too much from a portfolio during down markets is a bad idea, filing for Social Security might look compelling.",
      "But it could be a mistake to let what we hope will be a short-lived downturn steer you away from the lifetime benefits of delayed Social Security. Delayed filing can be particularly impactful if you\u2019re the higher earner in your family and you have a younger spouse who will receive that higher benefit for her lifetime.",
      "In our retirement income research, we found that the benefits of delaying filing until age 70 are greatest if you have other funds to draw from until then. And they\u2019re obviously more valuable for people with above-average life expectancies, in that they stand to receive that inflation-protected income for longer.",
      "If you need funds and have to choose between filing for Social Security and pulling from a depressed equity portfolio, consider filing for Social Security and then doing a \u201c withdrawal of benefits \u201d within a year of when you initially filed.",
      "Inflation is a key risk for retiree portfolios, because the income you receive from your safe investments is going to buy you less as you age.",
      "Many retirees focus exclusively on nominal bonds and underrate the value of inflation-protected bonds, but most of the better target-date series stake about a fourth of the bond positions in short-term Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities for people who have just retired.",
      "Another strategy is to build a laddered portfolio of TIPS that will mature and supply you with living expenses throughout your retirement.",
      "Finally, one small silver lining in market volatility is the opportunity to save on taxes.",
      "The early-retirement years are an excellent time to convert traditional IRA balances to Roth. The reason is that without income from work and because you won\u2019t be subject to required minimum distributions until you\u2019re 73, your income and, in turn, the taxes that you\u2019ll owe on conversions will be lower.",

      "Federal authorities this week unsealed an indictment charging Leo J. Govoni, 67, of Clearwater, and John Witeck, 60, of Tampa, with multiple counts including mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted on all counts, they face decades in prison.",
      "The case involves one of the nation\u2019s largest administrators of special needs trusts, which are designed to manage funds for people with special needs.",
      "The Center for Special Needs Trust Administration in Clearwater, which Govoni co-founded 25 years ago, managed more than 2,000 accounts containing about $200 million for people in Florida and around the nation. Clients were promised that the nonprofit would protect and invest their money, prosecutors say.",
      "But Govoni and Witeck, an accountant who worked with Govoni, used the nonprofit as a \u201cslush fund\u201d to enrich themselves, court papers state.",

      "The case was investigated by numerous federal agencies, including the FBI, the IRS and the Social Security Administration.",
      "\u201cNot only were the organization\u2019s resources drained, but the accused subjects betrayed the trust of the community and ultimately bankrupted a lifeline for vulnerable families,\" said Jose Perez, assistant director of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division.",

      "Relations between the neighbors have deteriorated following an armed confrontation on May 28 in which one Cambodian soldier was killed in a relatively small, contested territory along their border. While the two sides have agreed to de-escalate their dispute, they have continued to implement or threaten measures that have kept tensions high.",
      "The Thai army on Monday imposed heightened restrictions at border checkpoints with Cambodia following an order from Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra to allow only students, medical patients and others with essential needs to enter or leave Thailand. That also makes it impossible for thousands of tourists to cross between the two countries.",
      "Pen Bona, a spokesperson of the Cambodian government, said Tuesday that Cambodia has committed to resolve the conflict through diplomatic channels, but tensions have soared because of Thailand\u2019s actions.",
      "\u201cThe Cambodian government has already stated that we will not initiate any border closure,\u201d and that it will also lift restrictions if Thailand does so first, he said.",
      "Cambodia has boycotted some Thai internet services, banned Thai fruits and vegetables, and blocked electricity and fuel supplies from Thailand in response to the border dispute. Prior to the boycott, Cambodia imported 30% of its gasoline and other fuel from Thailand.",
      "Cambodia\u2019s Prime Minister Hun Manet on Monday visited troops at the border and a temporary shelter for thousands of civilians who were evacuated from the area. He said that while Cambodia doesn\u2019t want war, \u201cwe cannot stand by and let us be abused.\u201d",

      "BRAKPAN, South Africa -- Themba Maseko quickly wipes oil and grease off his hands with a rag as he breaks away from repairing one car to assist another customer who needs parts for a low-riding BMW 325is that he\u2019s pulled up in, exhausts booming.",
      "As soon as Maseko returns beneath the hood of the first vehicle to continue his work, yet another man arrives desperately wanting his car to be looked at.",
      "\u201cIt gets hectic,\u201d said the 39-year-old mechanic, sweat plastering his face.",
      "The father of three runs a small motor repair shop in the township of Tsakane, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of South Africa\u2019s biggest city of Johannesburg. His hopes for his business to succeed when it\u2019s up against established urban car service and repair centers have been boosted by a new initiative started at the end of last year.",
      "Maseko has joined with other mechanics from townships to form a cooperative. Together, they now have combined purchasing power to ensure they can source official car spares and equipment for their shops and don\u2019t get cut out of the market. The Motor Spares Collective means they can place orders to an online spares shop through WhatsApp and authentic parts are usually delivered to them in 24 hours.",
      "That avoids what Maseko says is his biggest challenge: spending hours away from his garage queuing for parts, sometimes to find there aren\u2019t any in stock because they\u2019ve been bought up by larger chains.",
      "As one busy day at his shop showed, the customers are lining up for Maseko\u2019s services, he just needs the parts.",
      "\u201cNow with the collective it\u2019s much easier. I don\u2019t have to go stand in queue and waste time,\u201d said Maseko, who changed career from an electrician to a full-time mechanic in 2008. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s at a cheaper price.\u201d",
      "The Motor Spares Collective is one initiative designed to unlock the potential of small township businesses in South Africa, which the government has identified as key to driving growth and creating jobs in areas where unemployment and poverty are high.",
      "Various studies indicate that more than 21 million people in South Africa live in townships on the edge of major cities or towns \u2014 a third of the population \u2014 and they have a combined spending power of billions of dollars and generally prefer local businesses.",
      "South Africa has over 700,000 registered small businesses. In the townships these include hair salons, taverns, car repair shops, laundromats and others sometimes operating out of people\u2019s homes. According to a report by financial services group Lesaka, South Africa\u2019s informal sector generates an estimated $33 billion in revenue, or more than 6% of GDP.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t respect the trade in the townships,\u201d said Sharief Bartus, another member of the motor spares collective.",
      "For a $10 monthly membership fee for the first year, Maseko and the others get more than just access to car parts and tools for their garages. The collective also offers skills development opportunities, help with business registration and financing.",
      "\u201cThe more members we get, the more discounts we get, the more work we have,\u201d said Dorian Slimmerts, another mechanic in the collective who is operating not far from Maseko.",
      "Township mechanics offering a local option for car owners have long battled on the fringes of the country\u2019s commercial auto manufacturing and repair sector. A regulation change in 2020 also made a big difference. New \u201cright to repair\u201d rules in South Africa mean car owners can now have their vehicles serviced by registered independent mechanics and not lose their warranties.",
      "That\u2019s opened the door a little more for township mechanics.",
      "Car maintenance is especially needed in South Africa, where there are around 12 million automobiles on the road and people are keeping their cars longer. The demand for affordable pre-owned cars has outpaced new cars since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Time is the critical element for township mechanics, though. Their businesses see lots of walk-in clients, prices are often negotiated and customers expect quick service \u2014 or they will look elsewhere.",
      "\u201cAll the mechanic sells is time,\u201d said Amanda Gcabashe, managing director of UBU Investment Holdings, an economic advisory company that helped set up the cooperative. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we came with this to say, how do we make sure that we then solve that pain point by making spares easily accessible?\u201d",

      "The National Transportation Safety Board is set to hold a public meeting about the door plug panel that blew out during a terrifying Alaska Airlines flight in January of 2024",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday will be focused on preventing another terrifying event like the one involving a panel that flew off a Boeing 737 Max midair in January of 2024.",
      "The board will discuss what NTSB investigators have uncovered over the past 17 months, including their revelation that bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair. Board members were also expected to approve recommendations to keep something similar from ever happening again.",
      "The blow out aboard Alaska Airlines flight 1282 occurred minutes after it took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum that sucked objects out of the cabin and scattered them on the ground below along with debris from the fuselage. Seven passengers and one flight attended received minor injuries, but no one was killed. Pilots were able to land the plane safely back at the airport.",
      "The accident occurred as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression and a few cellphones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane as 171 passengers contended with wind and roaring noise.",
      "The first six minutes of the flight to Southern California\u2019s Ontario International Airport were routine. The Boeing 737 Max 9 was about halfway to its cruising altitude and traveling at more than 400 mph (640 kph) when passengers described a loud \u201cboom\u201d and wind so strong it ripped the shirt off someone\u2019s back.",
      "\u201cWe knew something was wrong,\u201d Kelly Bartlett told The Associated Press in the days following the flight. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what. We didn\u2019t know how serious. We didn\u2019t know if it meant we were going to crash.\u201d",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot (61-centimeter-by-122-centimeter) piece of fuselage covering an unoperational emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",
      "The panel that blew off was made and installed by a supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. It was removed at a Boeing factory so workers could repair damaged rivets, but bolts that help secure the door plug weren\u2019t replaced. It\u2019s not clear who removed the panel.",
      "The NTSB said in a preliminary report that four bolts were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented.",
      "Boeing factory workers told NTSB investigators that they felt pressured to work too fast and were asked to perform jobs that they weren\u2019t qualified for, including opening and closing the door plug on the particular plane involved.",
      "A Boeing door installer said he was never told to take any shortcuts, but everyone faced pressure to keep the assembly line moving.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how mistakes are made. People try to work too fast,\u201d he told investigators. The installer and other workers were not named in documents about the probe.",
      "The Max version of Boeing\u2019s bestselling 737 airplane has been the source of persistent troubles for the company since two of the jets crashed, one in Indonesia in 2018 and another in Ethiopia in 2019, killing a combined 346 people.",
      "Investigators determined those crashes were caused by a system that relied on a sensor providing faulty readings to push the nose down, leaving pilots unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned the system.",
      "Last month, the Justice Department reached a deal allowing Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the Max before the two crashes.",
      "But regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration have capped Boeing's 737 Max production at 38 jets per month while investigators ensure the company has strengthened its safety practices.",
      "Boeing hired a new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, last year and created a new position for a senior vice president of quality to help improve its manufacturing.",
      "The company was back in the news earlier this month when a 787 flown by Air India crashed shortly after takeoff and killed at least 270 people. Investigators have not determined what caused that crash, but so far they have not found any flaws with the model, which has a strong safety record.",

      "An instructor glides between speaking Spanish and English as he teaches Manuel Castillo, a native Spanish speaker, how to inspect a school bus. They\u2019re using a printed script of English phrases to practice what Castillo would say during a roadside inspection.",
      "Brushing up on English has taken on new urgency for future and current truck drivers after President Donald Trump issued an executive order saying truckers who don\u2019t read and speak the language proficiently would be considered unfit for service.",
      "\u201cA driver who can\u2019t understand English will not drive a commercial vehicle in this country. Period,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said last month while announcing enforcement guidelines that take effect on Wednesday.",
      "Updated U.S. Department of Transportation procedures call for enhanced inspections to determine if commercial motor vehicle operators can reply to questions and directions in English, as well as understand highway traffic signs and electronic message boards.",
      "Truckers who learned English as a second language are concerned they may lose their jobs if they make a mistake or speak with a heavy accent while under questioning. Some have worked to improve their English fluency by taking classes, reciting scripts and watching instructional videos.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s not the language that you prefer to use daily, you may get a little nervous and you may feel, \u2018What if I say the wrong thing?\u2019\u201d said Jerry Maldonado, chairman of the board of the Laredo Motor Carriers Association, a trade association in Laredo, Texas, that represents approximately 200 trucking companies. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be, at the end of the day, the interpretation of the officer, so that makes people nervous.\u201d",
      "The guidance applies to truck and bus drivers engaged in interstate commerce. It aims to improve road safety following incidents in which truck drivers' inability to read signs or speak English may have contributed to traffic deaths, the Transportation Department said.",
      "Requiring truck drivers to speak and read English isn\u2019t new, but the penalty for not meeting the proficiency standard is becoming more severe.",
      "To get a commercial driver\u2019s license, applicants must pass a written test and be able to name the parts of a bus or truck in English as they check tire inflation, tread depth, lug nuts and coolants.",
      "The revised policy reverses guidance issued nine years ago, near the end of then-President Barack Obama\u2019s final term, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. In 2016, the agency said drivers whose English skills were found lacking could receive a citation but not be prohibited from working. Before that, the penalty was getting placed on \u201cout-of-service status.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have bridges that get hit because drivers don\u2019t understand the signs on the bridges for things like height clearance,\u201d Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association President Todd Spencer said.",
      "In Laredo, a border city where many residents speak a mix of English and Spanish, Maldonado\u2019s association is offering free English classes on weekends to help truckers feel more confident in their ability to communicate.",
      "\u201cEverybody knows what a stop sign looks like,\u201d Maldonado said. \u201cBut if there\u2019s construction or if there is an accident five miles down the road, and they have to put up a sign \u2014 \u2018Caution, must exit now, road closed ahead,\u2019 and you are not able to read that or understand that, that could potentially be a safety issue.\u201d",
      "At Driving Academy in Linden, New Jersey, multilingual instructors teach students how to inspect vehicle parts in their first language and then provide explanations in English, according to founder Jonathan Marques. The school created scripts so students could practice what to say if they're stopped, he said.",
      "Students are advised to watch training videos as homework, while licensed truckers can listen to English language apps instead of music when they're on the road, Marques suggested.",
      "Instructor Paul Cuartas helps students prepare but worries that inspectors will now expect truckers and bus drivers to have perfect English. \u201cI\u2019m concerned because now for all the Spanish people it\u2019s more difficult,\u201d he said.",
      "Castillo, who moved to the U.S. from Ecuador in 1993, said he has no problem understanding English but has been watching videos to study industry terms. \u201cSome words I don\u2019t understand, but I try to learn more English,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked whether he supports the president's executive order, Castillo said he voted for Trump but doesn\u2019t agree with the president's push to deport some immigrants who haven\u2019t committed crimes.",
      "\u201cHe makes a lot of problems, especially for Hispanic people,\u201d Castillo said.",
      "GTR Trucking School in Detroit also has offered students ESL classes. Co-owner Al Myftiu drove a truck after moving to the U.S. from Albania in 1993. He said he wants to create a small book of phrases that truckers need to learn.",
      "For students with a thick accent, \u201cI tell them, \u2018Slow down, speak slowly and people can understand you, and if you don\u2019t understand something, you can ask,\u2019\" Myftiu said.",
      "Roadside inspections can be initiated over issues such as a faulty brake light or on a routine basis, and often take place at weigh stations.",
      "The guidance directs inspectors who suspect a driver doesn\u2019t understand what they're saying to administer an English proficiency test, which includes both an interview and a highway traffic sign recognition component.",
      "In the past, some drivers used translation apps to communicate with federal inspectors. The updated policy bars the use of interpreters, smartphones, cue cards or other aids during interviews.",
      "Several truck drivers taking a break at Flying J Travel Center in New Jersey said they support Trump's order, adding that drivers who heavily rely on translation programs probably wouldn\u2019t be able to read important signs.",
      "\u201cWe try to ask them questions about the business just to strike a conversation, ... and they\u2019re not able to communicate with us at all,\u201d Kassem Elkhatib, one of the drivers at Flying J, said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how safety inspectors will decide whether a driver knows enough English because that portion of the instructions was redacted from the guidance distributed by Transportation Department.",
      "The department advised motor carriers that drivers should be able to answer questions about shipping documents, the origin and destination of trips, and how long they've been on duty.",
      "A trucker placed out of service and the company they work for are responsible for ensuring a language violation is corrected before the driver hits the highway again, the Transportation Department said.",
      "Truck drivers who practice the Sikh religion already face discrimination in hiring and at loading docks, according to Mannirmal Kaur, federal policy manager for Sikh Coalition, an advocacy group. Now they are worried about inspectors making subjective, non-standardized determinations about which of them are proficient in English, she said.",
      "\u201cA truck driver who does speak English sufficiently to comply with federal standards but maybe they speak with an accent, or maybe they use a different vocabulary that the inspector isn\u2019t used to hearing: Is that person then going to be subject to an English language violation?\u201d Kaur asked. \u201cAnd under the new policy, are they then going to be designated out-of-service, which could result in unemployment?\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. entry into Israel\u2019s war with Iran has caused travel disruptions to pile up globally.",
      "Following unprecedented bombings ordered by President Donald Trump on three Iranian nuclear and military sites over the weekend, Iran on Monday launched a missile attack on U.S. forces at Qatar's Al Udeid Air Base. Qatar had closed its airspace just hours earlier, after both the U.S. and U.K. also urged their citizens to shelter in place there.",
      "The region has been on edge following the weekend strikes from the U.S. \u2014 and since Israel began the war with a surprise bombardment on Iran, which has responded with its own missile and drone strikes, earlier this month.",
      "As deadly attacks escalated between Israel and Iran, sections of airspace and airports throughout the region have temporarily closed. And airlines canceled more flights in recent days, with some halting select routes through the middle of the week \u2014 particularly in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, just across the Persian Gulf from Iran.",
      "The Middle East carriers were severely affected with cancellations and delays. Qatar Airways said its flights were suspended because of the closure of air traffic in Qatar.",
      "\u201cThe airline is working closely with government stakeholders and the relevant authorities to support impacted passengers, and will resume operations when the airspace reopens,\u201d it said, while warning that delays were likely even after operations resume.",
      "Additional ground staff was sent to Hamad International Airport and other key airports to assist affected passengers, it said.",
      "Emirates suspended all flights to Iran and Iraq, including those serving Baghdad and Basra, until and including Monday 30 June 2025. An unspecified number of other Emirates flights were rerouted but continuing to operate flights as scheduled, using flight paths well distanced from conflict areas. Some flights may be delayed.",
      "Etihad Airways, the other of the two flag carriers of the United Arab Emirates, suspended all flights between Abu Dhabi and Tel Aviv through 15 July, and also announced several regional flight cancellations for Monday and Tuesday, including those connecting Abu Dhabi to and from Kuwait, Doha, Dammam and Muscat.",
      "Gulf Air, the carrier of the Kingdom of Bahrain, extended the cancellation of scheduled flights to Jordan and until June 27.",
      "\u201cAs the safety of its passengers and crew members remains a top priority, Gulf Air will continue to monitor developments in the region closely, and work with its partners to help accommodate and reroute passengers affected by these flight cancellations,\u201d it said.",
      "Singapore Airlines, for example, canceled some flights to and from Dubai starting Sunday and through Wednesday, citing \u201ca security assessment of the geopolitical situation in the Middle East.\u201d And British Airways has similarly suspended flights to and from Doha through Wednesday.",
      "\u201cSafety is always our highest priority,\u201d British Airways said in a statement confirming its cancellations to The Associated Press, adding that it \u201cwill keep the situation under review.\u201d",
      "Air India on Monday announced it was ceasing \u201call operations to the region as well as to and from the East Coast of North America and Europe\u201d immediately until further notice. The airline, which is still reeling from a plane crash that killed at least 270 people earlier this month, added that India-bound flights from North America were being diverted or rerouted away from closed airspaces.",
      "Air tracking data from FlightAware showed 243 cancellations worldwide as of Tuesday. Dubai International Airport topped the list with 26 cancellations in and out of the airport as of 0600 GMT. And Air India had had the highest amount of cancellations among carriers, totaling 25 at about 0600 GMT.",
      "In other developments, Philippine Airlines canceled several flights to the Middle East, including those to Doha, Dubai and Riyadh for Tuesday and one to Doha Wednesday. Japan Airlines said a flight from Tokyo's Haneda airport to Doha had to return Monday, and subsequently scheduled flights have all been canceled through June 27.",
      "A Qatar Airways flight from Hong Kong to Doha was canceled on Tuesday. Hong Kong\u2019s flagship carrier Cathay Pacific said none of its flights enter the airspace of Israel, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Jordan or Lebanon, and their operations to and from the Middle East remain normal.",
      "Such disruptions have snarled travel, particularly as central hubs in the Middle East often connect flights worldwide \u2014 but experts stress that these kind of airspace closures and flight diversions are critical to ensuring safety, especially if future escalation emerges suddenly.",
      "\u201cIt is the responsibility of states, countries to ensure that their airspace is safe for passage of aircraft,\u201d Hassan Shahidi, president and CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation. He added that on Monday \u201cthe Qataris did the absolutely right thing to close their airspace because of the threat of conflict.\u201d",
      "Beyond Qatari airspace, Flightradar24 reported that UAE airspace was also closed on Monday. After several hours of diversions, flights appeared to be landing and taking off in the country again.",
      "Monday marks the latest \u201cdramatic increase\u201d in this kind of impact, said Ian Petchenik, director of communications at Flightradar24. And while the future is unknown, he added that it's important to remember airspace closures and flight cancellations reflect that \u201cairlines, air traffic controllers and flight crews are doing their best to keep everybody safe.\u201d",
      "Shahidi adds that it's important for travelers to monitor government guidance \u2014 such as safety notices from the U.S. State Department.",
      "How long the war lasts and what, if any, future escalation comes next could carry more widespread implications. Beyond disrupting global flight networks farther down the road, Shahidi stresses that it's very difficult for people who may need or want to evacuate countries impacted by the war to do so without access to commercial flights.",
      "At the same time, he adds, it's critical that state authorities focus on keeping their skies safe \u2014 pointing to past tragedies of passenger flights that were shot down by strikes. That includes Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down by Russian-backed forces while flying over Ukraine in 2014, killing 298 people.",
      "\u201cWe are all praying and urging resolution to this conflict \u2014 and especially as it relates to protection of civilian air travel,\" Shahidi said. \"We do not want to have an MH17, with innocent lives being lost in a missile strike ... We do not want to repeat that history.\u201d",

      "Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman on Monday said the central bank should consider cutting its key interest rate as soon as its next meeting in July, underscoring deep divisions among Fed officials as they endure sharp criticism from the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman on Monday said the central bank should consider cutting its key interest rate as soon as its next meeting in July, underscoring deep divisions among Fed officials as they endure sharp criticism from the White House.",
      "Bowman said that President Donald Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, and any upcoming increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise.",
      "\u201cIt is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed, and have a smaller effect than initially expected,\u201d Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. \u201cShould inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting,\u201d which is scheduled for July 29-30.",
      "Bowman, who was appointed to the Fed's board of governors by Donald Trump in 2018, is the second high-profile official to express support for a potential July cut in as many days. On Friday, Christopher Waller, also a Trump appointee to the Fed's board, said in a television interview that the Fed should consider cutting borrowing costs next month.",
      "The blunt calls for rate cuts by Waller and Bowman differ from Fed Chair Jerome Powell's suggestion in a news conference last week that the central bank would monitor the economy over the summer and see how inflation responded to tariffs before deciding whether to reduce borrowing costs.",
      "The comments arrive as Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting rates, calling the Fed chair a \u201cnumbskull\u201d and a \u201cfool\u201d for not doing so, raising concerns about the Fed's independence from politics. The president claims Fed cuts would reduce the government\u2019s borrowing costs, though the rates the government pays are mostly set by market forces, not the Fed.",
      "Bowman appeared particularly dismissive toward the threat of tariffs, which many economists say could slow growth, particularly if companies absorb the cost of the duties rather than passing them on to consumers. Doing so would cut their profit margins, which would reduce their ability to hire and invest in new business.",
      "\u201cSmall and one-off price increases this year should translate only into a small drag on real activity,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI also expect that less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more friendly business environment will likely boost supply and largely offset any negative effects on economic activity and prices.\u201d",
      "When the Fed lowers the short-term interest rate it controls, it often reduces borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and business loans. Yet sometimes financial markets keep longer-term rates higher: The Fed cut its rate a full percentage point last year, to about 4.3%, but mortgage rates only declined slighty.",
      "On Friday, Waller told CNBC that with inflation remaining tame and the economy potentially slowing, the Fed should consider a rate cut next month. He pointed to rising unemployment among recent college graduates as a sign of possible weakening in the economy, and said it was better to cut before the labor market noticeably worsened.",
      "\u201cI'm all in favor of saying maybe we should start thinking about cutting the policy rate at the next meeting, because we don\u2019t want to wait until the job market tanks before we start cutting,\u201d Waller said.",
      "Still, at last week's Fed meeting, seven of the 19 officials who participate in the central bank's interest-rate decisions supported keeping rates unchanged for the rest of this year, and two penciled in just one cut.",
      "Inflation has steadily cooled this year despite widespread concerns among economists that Trump's tariffs would boost prices. The consumer price index ticked up just 0.1% from April to May, the government said last week, a sign that price pressures are muted. Prices for some goods rose last month, but the cost for many services such as air fares and hotels fell, offsetting any tariff impact.",
      "Compared with a year ago, prices rose 2.4% in May, up from 2.3% in April.",
      "Trump has slapped a 10% duty on all imports, along with an additional 30% levy on goods from China, 50% on steel and aluminum, and 25% on autos.",
      "Still, many economists say it is likely that tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months. Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested at a news conference last week that the central bank wants to closely monitor how inflation evolves over the next few months before deciding whether to cut rates.",
      "Also Friday, Mary Daly, president of the Fed's San Francisco branch, said on CNBC that she looked \u201cmore to the fall\u201d as an appropriate time to cut rates.",

      "\u201cEverybody is raising their hand right now,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to decide.\u201d",
      "Among those likely in the running is the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant in Oswego. Hochul\u2019s administration has been supportive of Maryland power company Constellation\u2019s bid to build a new nuclear reactor at the two-reactor facility.",
      "American utilities have been broadly reluctant to launch new nuclear plants due to high cost overruns and delays on recent high-profile projects.",
      "Georgia Power Company completed the first two new nuclear reactors in the country in a generation last year. But Units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle in Waynesboro, Georgia, cost nearly $35 billion and were powered up some seven years later than initially hoped.",
      "Last month, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation\u2019s largest public power company, applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop what it bills as a next-generation nuclear power plant at its Clinch River site in Oak Ridge. The federally owned utility provides electricity to seven states and operates three traditional, large nuclear power plants, providing about 40% of the Tennessee Valley\u2019s power.",
      "New York currently has three active nuclear plants, all located upstate along Lake Ontario and owned by Constellation. The Nine Mile Point, Robert Emmett Ginna and James A. FitzPatrick plants provide about 3.3 gigawatts of power, or roughly 20% of the state\u2019s electricity, according to Hochul\u2019s office.",
      "The last nuclear power plant built in the state was Unit 2 at Nine Mile Point in 1989. At its peak, nuclear power provided about 5.4 gigawatts, or roughly one-third of the state\u2019s electrical supply, according to the advocacy group Nuclear New York.",
      "The New York Power Authority previously operated two nuclear plants, including the Indian Point Power Plant, which shut down in 2021. That facility was located along the Hudson River some 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of New York City in Buchanan.",
      "The other facility, once operated by the state, was the FitzPatrick plant, which the power authority sold in 2000 and is now run by Constellation.",

      "A federal judge who blocked the Trump administration from dismantling Voice of America is seeking more information from the government about whether it is complying with his order preserving the 83-year-old international news service",
      "WASHINGTON -- The federal judge who blocked the Trump administration from dismantling Voice of America is seeking more information from the government about whether it is complying with his order preserving the 83-year-old international news service.",
      "During a hearing on Monday, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth asked a Justice Department attorney why the government hadn't informed him of layoff notices that were sent Friday to over 600 employees of Voice of America and the federal agency that oversees it.",
      "The government lawyer, Brenda Gonzalez Horowitz, told Lamberth that the agency has been complying with his April 22 order \u201cin good faith.\u201d She said the administration is serious about its responsibility to keep him informed.",
      "\u201cI don't think so,\u201d the judge replied.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorney William Schultz argued that the administration isn't following Lamberth's order and failed to restore VOA programming in line with its mandate from Congress, which appropriated $262 million for VOA in the 2025 fiscal year. Schultz, who represents VOA journalists, said virtually its entire staff has been on paid administrative leave for more than three months.",
      "\u201cHaving people sit at home is not complying with these statutes or congressional appropriations,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge gave the administration until Friday to file a written update on what it is doing at VOA.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorneys asked Lamberth to order the administration to develop a plan that would operate VOA in a manner that complies with the preliminary injunction in the case. The judge didn't immediately rule on that request.",
      "Approximately 1,400 people at Voice of America and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, or 85% of its workforce, have lost their jobs since March, said Kari Lake, Trump\u2019s senior advisor to the agency. She said it was part of a \u201clong-overdue effort to dismantle a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor decades, American taxpayers have been forced to bankroll an agency that\u2019s been riddled with dysfunction, bias and waste,\u201d Lake said in a news release. \u201cThat ends now.\u201d",
      "Recipients of the layoff notices included employees at VOA\u2019s Persian-language service who were brought back from administrative leave last week to broadcast reports to Iran following Israel\u2019s attack.",
      "Most VOA employees have been on administrative leave since March 15, their broadcasts and social media posts mostly silenced.",
      "\u201cWhat would be the purpose of Voice of America if there was no voice?\u201d Lamberth asked.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorney Georgina Yeomans said the administration's plans for VOA have been \u201cremarkably hard to pin down.\u201d",
      "VOA began by broadcasting stories about American democracy to residents of Nazi Germany and grew to deliver news around the world in dozens of languages, often in countries without a tradition of free press.",

      "European nations worked Monday to keep alive diplomatic efforts to curb the Israel-Iran war as the two countries traded strikes following the United States\u2019 weekend attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program",
      "LONDON -- European nations worked Monday to keep diplomatic efforts to curb the Israel-Iran war alive as the two countries traded strikes following the United States\u2019 weekend attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Calls for Tehran to enter talks with Washington appeared to fall on deaf ears as it reached out to ally Russia for support.",
      "The crisis topped the agenda for European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels, where diplomats agonized about the potential for Iranian retaliation to spark a wider war and global economic instability.",
      "\u201cThe concerns of retaliation and this war escalating are huge,\u201d said the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.",
      "Kallas said any attempt by Iran to close the Strait of Hormuz, a key route for global shipping, would be \u201cextremely dangerous and not good for anybody.\u201d",
      "Along with the EU, the \u201cE3\u201d of Britain, France and Germany have led efforts to find a diplomatic solution, holding a tense seven-hour meeting in Geneva on Friday with Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. A day after those talks ended with a vague promise to \"meet again in the future,\u201d U.S. bombers struck three Iranian nuclear and military sites.",
      "No further E3 talks with Iran are currently planned, a European diplomatic official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations.",
      "Still, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy urged Iran to meet the E3 again, and to open negotiations with the United States. Planned U.S.-Iran talks in Oman were scuttled after Israel began attacking Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities on June 13. Iran has since ruled out negotiating while it is under attack.",
      "\u201cTake the off-ramp, dial this thing down and negotiate with the United States immediately and seriously,\" said Lammy, who spoke to both Araghchi and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday.",
      "German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Europe had a role to play, but that \u201ca real precondition for a settlement to the conflict is that Iran be ready to negotiate directly with the U.S.\u201d",
      "Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told reporters in Brussels that he was proposing a meeting between the United States and Iran in Rome.",
      "It was Moscow that Iran reached out to Monday, though, sending Araghchi to meet President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. Putin condemned the United States\u2019 \u201cunprovoked aggression\u201d against Iran and said Russia would help the Iranian people.",
      "Putin said he saw the visit as a chance to explore \u201chow we can get out of today\u2019s situation.\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had offered to mediate.",
      "European diplomatic efforts were complicated by a lack of foreknowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s moves. Some countries had no advance notice of the strikes. Britain was notified, but only shortly before bombs fell.",
      "Another hurdle was Trump\u2019s post on social media late Sunday musing about the potential for \u201cregime change\u201d in Iran, despite U.S. officials\u2019 insistence that Washington is not seeking to change the government in Tehran.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot stressed Monday that \u201cwe reject all attempts to organize a change of regime by force.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be illusory and dangerous to think that such a change can be provoked through force and bombs,\u201d he said.",
      "Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, and U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran is not actively pursuing a bomb. However, Trump and Israeli leaders have argued that Iran could quickly assemble a nuclear weapon, making it an imminent threat.",
      "The U.S. strikes have brought mixed emotions in European capitals. Amid alarm at the potential for a wider war and calls for de-escalation, some American allies expressed relief that Iran\u2019s nuclear program had been set back.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t pretend that the prevention of Iran getting nuclear weapons isn\u2019t a good thing for this country. But we\u2019re prioritizing diplomacy as the way forward,\u201d said Tom Wells, a spokesman for British leader Starmer. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s priority is getting parties back around the table to negotiate a lasting settlement.\u201d",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, whose country is a particularly staunch ally of Israel, said he saw \u201cno reason to criticize what Israel began a week ago, and also no reason to criticize what America did last weekend.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged \u201cit is not without risk, but leaving things the way they were was also not an option.\u201d",
      "Merz said he was \u201csomewhat optimistic\u201d that the conflict would not widen. He said Iran\u2019s response so far has been far short \u201cof what we had to fear,\u201d and that Iran\u2019s regional proxies had shown \u201crelatively little\u201d reaction so far.",

      "The war between Israel and Iran has raised concerns that Iran could retaliate by trying to close the Strait of Hormuz, the world's most important oil chokepoint due to the large volumes of crude that pass through it every day.",
      "The U.S. military\u2019s strike on three sites in Iran over the weekend has raised questions about how its military might respond.",
      "The Strait of Hormuz is between Oman and Iran, which boasts a fleet of fast-attack boats and thousands of naval mines as well as missiles that it could use to make the strait impassable, at least for a time.",
      "Iran\u2019s main naval base at Bandar Abbas is on the north coast of the strait. It could also fire missiles from its long Persian Gulf shore, as its allies, Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, have done in the Red Sea.",
      "About 20 million barrels of oil per day, or around 20% of the world\u2019s oil consumption, passed through the strait in 2024. Most of that oil goes to Asia.",
      "Here is a look at the waterway and its impact on the global economy:",
      "The strait connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. It's only 33 kilometers (21 miles) wide at its narrowest point, but deep enough and wide enough to handle the world's largest crude oil tankers.",
      "Oil that passes through the strait comes from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Bahrain, while major supplies of liquefied natural gas come from Qatar. At its narrowest point, the sea lanes for tankers lie in Omani waters, and before and after that cross into Iranian territory.",
      "While some global oil chokepoints can be circumvented by taking longer routes that simply add costs, that's not an option for most of the oil moving through the strait.",
      "That's because the pipelines that could be used to carry the oil on land, such as Saudi Arabia's East-West pipeline, they don't have nearly enough capacity. \u201cMost volumes that transit the strait have no alternative means of exiting the region,\u201d according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "If Iran blocked the strait, oil prices could shoot as high as $120-$130 per barrel, at least temporarily, said Homayoun Falakshahi, head of crude oil analyst at Kpler, in an online webinar Sunday.",
      "That would deal an inflationary shock to the global economy \u2014 if it lasted. Analysts think it wouldn't.",
      "Asia would be directly impacted because 84% of the oil moving through the strait is headed for Asia; top destinations are China, India, Japan and South Korea. China gets 47% of its seaborne oil from the Gulf. China, however, has an oil inventory of 1.1 billion barrels, or 2 1/2 months of supply.",
      "U.S. oil customers would feel the impact of the higher prices but would not lose much supply. The U.S. imported only about 7% of its oil from Persian Gulf countries through the strait in 2024, according to the USEIA. That was the lowest level in nearly 40 years.",
      "Closing the strait would cut off Iran's own oil exports. While Iran does have a new terminal under construction at Jask, just outside the strait, the new facility has loaded oil only once and isn't in a position to replace the strait, according to Kpler analysts.",
      "Closure would hit China, Iran's largest trading partner and only remaining oil customer, and harm its oil-exporting Arab neighbors, who are at least officially supporting it in its war with Israel.",
      "And it would mean blocking Oman's territorial waters, offending a country that has served as a mediator between the U.S. and Iran.",
      "Any price spike would probably not last. One big reason: Analysts expect that the U.S. Navy would intervene to keep the strait open. In the 1980s, U.S. warships escorted Kuwaiti oil tankers through the strait to protect them against Iranian attacks during the Iran-Iraq war.",
      "A price spike \u201cwouldn't last very long\u201d and the strait would likely be reopened \u201cvery fast,\u201d said Kpler's Falakshahi.",
      "U.S. use of force to reopen the strait would likely be supported by Europe and \u201ceven unofficially by China,\u201d he said. \u201cIran's navy would probably get destroyed in a matter of hours or days.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes edged higher in May, as stubbornly high mortgage rates and rising prices made homebuying less affordable even as the inventory of properties on the market continued to increase.",
      "Existing home sales rose 0.8% last month from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.03 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.",
      "Sales fell 0.7% compared with May last year. The latest home sales fell topped the 3.95 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.",
      "\u201cThe sluggish sales activity one can attribute essentially to affordability,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist.",
      "Home prices increased on an annual basis for the 23rd consecutive month, although the rate of growth continued to slow. The national median sales price rose 1.3% in May from a year earlier to $422,800, an all-time high for the month of May.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a slump since early 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Home sales fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, which it set in mid-January, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. The low point for this year arrived five weeks ago, when the average rate briefly dropped to 6.62%. Last week, it averaged 6.81%.",
      "Homes purchased last month likely went under contract in April and May, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage ranged from 6.62% to 6.89%.",
      "High mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, remain a key affordability hurdle for many would-be homebuyers. Years of soaring home prices have helped put homeownership out of reach. The median U.S. home sales price is up 52% since May 2019, while the U.S. median annual income has risen 30% in the same period, Yun noted.",
      "While price growth has slowed, elevated mortgage rates and rising prices are forcing prospective homebuyers to save more for a down payment. In May, buyers needed an annual income of $91,960 to afford a typical home with a 20% down payment, or nearly 87% more than in May 2019, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current mortgage rates benefited from a wider selection of properties on the market.",
      "There were 1.54 million unsold homes at the end of last month, a 6.2% increase from April, and 20.3% higher than May last year, NAR said. That\u2019s still well below the roughly 2 million homes for sale that was typical before the pandemic, however.",
      "May\u2019s month-end inventory translates to a 4.6-month supply at the current sales pace, up from a 4.4-month pace at the end of April and 3.8 months in May last year. Traditionally, a 5- to 6-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers.",

      "Compass wants an injunction that would prohibit Zillow from implementing and enforcing its \u2018Zillow Ban\u2019 and implementing and enforcing similar policies. The company also wants a trial by jury and an unspecified amount in damages.",
      "A Zillow spokesperson said in a statement on Monday that the company believes the claims in the lawsuit are unfounded and that it will vigorously defend against them.",
      "\"Our focus remains on creating a level playing field that serves the best interests of everyone in the home buying and selling journey,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "The housing market is always competitive, but has become more fierce of late. Last month the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in April, as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices discouraged prospective homebuyers during what\u2019s traditionally the busiest time of the year for the housing market.",
      "Existing home sales dropped 0.5% in April, from March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. The sales decline marked the slowest sales pace for the month of April going back to 2009 in the wake of the U.S. housing crisis. March\u2019s sales pace was also the slowest for that month going back to 2009.",
      "Sales of existing homes barely moved in May, with existing home sales up 0.8% last month from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.03 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Stubbornly high mortgage rates and rising prices made homebuying less affordable even as the inventory of properties on the market continued to increase.",
      "There's also been the issue of more sellers than homebuyers, with potential buyers skittish over high prices and mortgage rates. As of April, the U.S. housing market had nearly 34% more sellers than buyers shopping for a home, according to an analysis by Redfin.",
      "Aside from April 2020, when the pandemic brought the economy and home sales activity to a standstill, there haven\u2019t been this few buyers in the market for a home before, based on records that date back to 2013.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Oman plans to levy personal income tax as part of a broader push to move the sultanate\u2019s economy away from reliance on hydrocarbons.",
      "The tax would be a first among the six-member oil-rich Gulf Cooperation Council. The 5% tax will start in 2028 and will only be required of those who make upward of $109,000 annually \u2014 the top 1% of earners in Oman.",
      "The plan was issued Sunday by royal decree and reported by the official Oman News Agency.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether this will inspire other nations in the area to follow suit, though the International Monetary Fund has predicted that Gulf states may need to impose new taxes in the coming years to diversify government revenues.",
      "The lack of income tax so far has been a boon for development in the Gulf, helping to attract migrant workers to the region.",
      "But for Oman, the introduction of the income tax \u201cwill further prioritize financial stability by diversifying revenue sources\u201d that will help shelter the country from \u201cfluctuations\u201d in the global energy market, Minister of Economy Said bin Mohammed Al-Saqri said",
      "He added that oil and gas revenues can account for up to 85% of the nation\u2019s public income, depending on the market.",
      "\"The tax serves as a new revenue stream to diversify public income sources and mitigate risks associated with reliance on oil as the primary revenue source,\" Al-Saqri said.",
      "Oman has been weighing the personal income tax for several years, and its introduction follows other fiscal reforms. In 2020, it rolled out a program to cut down public debt and boost economic development. The move, Al-Saqri said, is part of Oman\u2019s broader Vision 2040 project, which hopes to turn the country into a technology-based economy.",

      "The nation\u2019s major health insurers are promising to scale back and improve a widely despised practice that leads to care delays and complications.",
      "UnitedHealthcare, CVS Health's Aetna and dozens of other insurers said Monday that they plan to reduce the scope of health care claims subject to prior authorization, standardize the process and expand the number of responses done in real time.",
      "Prior authorization means insurers require approval before they\u2019ll cover medical care, a prescription or a service like an imaging exam. Insurers say they do this to guard against care overuse and to make sure patients get the right treatment.",
      "But doctors say the practice has grown in scope and complication, leading to frequent care delays. The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December prompted many people to vent their frustrations with coverage issues like prior authorization.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz called prior the practice \u201ca pox on the system\u201d that hikes administrative costs during his Senate confirmation hearing in March to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re sort of trapped between care being unaffordable and then these non-financial barriers and administrative burdens growing worse,\u201d said Michael Anne Kyle, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies how patients access care.",
      "Nearly all customers of Medicare Advantage plans, the privately run version of the federal government's Medicare program, need prior authorization for some services, particularly expensive care like hospital stays, the health policy research organization KFF found in a study of 2023 claims. The study also found that insurers denied about 6% of all requests.",
      "Dr. Ashley Sumrall of Charlotte, North Carolina, says she has seen an increase in prior authorizations required for routine exams like MRIs. An oncologist who treats brain tumors, Sumrall said these images are critical for doctors to determine whether a treatment is working and to plan next steps.",
      "Doctors say delays from requests that are eventually approved or coverage rejections can harm patients by giving a disease time to progress untreated. They also can spike anxiety in patients who want to know whether their tumor has stopped growing and if insurance will cover the scan.",

      "Different forms and varied prior authorization policies also complicate the process. Sumrall noted that every insurer \u201chas their own way of doing business.\u201d",

      "Here are some expert recommendations to help you take care of your finances and your mental health if you've lost your job:",
      "Losing your job can cause a lot of stress and financial anxiety, so it\u2019s important that you take time to emotionally process.",
      "\u201cAcknowledge and normalize that they're going to feel a range of emotions, whether it's anger or sadness,\u201d Bryan-Podvin said.",
      "Whether you are feeling sadness, shock, anger or even relief, taking a moment to feel those emotions can help you move forward.",
      "To make plans for the future, it\u2019s essential that you review your current financial situation, said career coach Marlo Lyons.",
      "If you have a budget, take a closer look and review whether you have expenses that you can temporarily cut to save money. Lyons recommends that you know how long your severance package will last if you\u2019re receiving one.",
      "Applying for unemployment benefits as soon as possible can help alleviate some of the financial stress of a layoff. While the amount you get for unemployment might not be as much as your salary, it can help you to stay afloat for some time, Lyons said.",
      "The Labor Department has tips on applying for unemployment.",
      "Getting laid off from a job can affect your self-esteem, so Bryan-Podvin recommends that you create a list of good qualities about yourself that add to your overall value as a person. Bryan-Podvin calls this a \u201cnon-financial asset list.\"",

      "\u201cIn a layoff, it becomes even more imperative that you treat every dollar with more attention than you have in the past,\u201d Mecham said.",
      "Part of YNAB\u2019s budgeting strategy is giving each dollar a job, whether it is to pay rent, buy groceries or add to your savings account.",
      "When adjusting your spending, Bryan-Podvin also recommends that you approach this with some compassion. Since cutting back can bleed into not doing activities that make you happy, she recommends reminding yourself that this is a temporary pause rather than a permanent change in your lifestyle.",
      "While utilizing your credit card to pay for some expenses is almost inevitable, it\u2019s best to not completely lean on credit while you\u2019re searching for a new job.",
      "\u201cIf getting a new job takes them a little longer than they thought, that credit card has just become an anchor for them,\u201d Mecham said.",
      "Even though unemployment is temporary, Mecham recommends cutting expenses rather than keeping them at the same level and leaning on credit.",
      "Look for community resources, whether that means finding a food bank near you or applying for a temporary hardship program.",
      "\u201cLots of communities offer temporary hardship programs when it comes to necessary bills, such as electricity or water,\u201d Bryan-Podvin said.",
      "USA.Gov offers a benefit finder where you can find available programs and how to apply.",
      "As you are applying to new jobs, Lyons recommends that you take some time to assess if your professional goals are still the same.",
      "If you\u2019re continuing in the same field, Lyons recommends that you make your resume \u201cforward-looking,\u201d which means showing your future employer what you can do, not just what you have done.",
      "\u201cYou want to show the employer what you can do, what unique value you can bring to that particular job that no other candidate can bring because of your previous experience,\u201d Lyons said.",
      "Lyons also recommends that you activate your network by reaching out to past colleagues on LinkedIn or attending industry networking events. Online certifications are another great way to make yourself a better candidate, she added.",
      "Having a routine can help you take care of your mental health and keep a cadence of applying to jobs.",

      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",

      "BANGKOK -- Global markets appeared to take the U.S. strike against nuclear targets in Iran in stride as investors watched Monday to see how Iran will react.",
      "The price of oil initially jumped more than 2%, fell and then regained about half that much. U.S. stock futures edged lower and share benchmarks in Europe and Asia also were mostly lower.",
      "The attacks on three Iranian sites raised the stakes in the war between Israel and Iran and left questions about what remains of Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. It also increased the possibility that Iran might retaliate, potentially disrupting shipping through the narrow Strait of Hormuz, a waterway through which much of the world\u2019s crude oil passes.",
      "The big unknown is what Iran will do, analysts said.",
      "The price of Brent crude oil, the international standard, was up 1.2% at $77.91 per barrel. U.S. benchmark crude climbed 1.3% to $74.79.",
      "The future for the S&P 500 was little changed, while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1%. Treasury yields were steady.",

The one big hit by the Americans will be effective and then we\u2019ll get back to sort of business as usual, in which case there is no need for an immediate, panicky type of reaction,\u201d said Neil Newman, managing director of Atris Advisory Japan.",
      "The conflict began with an Israeli attack against Iran on June 13 that sent oil prices yo-yoing and rattled other markets.",
      "Closing off the Strait of Hormuz would be technically difficult but it could severely disrupt transit through it, sending insurance rates spiking and making shippers nervous to move without U.S. Navy escorts. As a major oil producer, Iran may be reluctant to close down the waterway, which is used to transport its own crude, mostly to China. Oil is a major revenue source for the regime.",
      "\u201cThe situation remains highly fluid, and much hinges on whether Tehran opts for a restrained reaction or a more aggressive course of action,\u201d Kristian Kerr, head of macro strategy at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina, said in a commentary.",
      "Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said disrupting traffic through the strait would be \u201ceconomic suicide\" and would elicit a U.S. response.",
      "\"I would encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that because they heavily depend on the Strait of Hormuz for their oil,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "When asked about that at a routine briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing that \u201cChina is willing to strengthen communication with Iran and relevant parties to continue playing a constructive role in promoting de-escalation\" of the conflict.",

      "Tom Kloza, chief market analyst at Turner Mason & Co said he expects Iranian leaders to refrain from drastic measures and oil futures to ease back after the initial fears blow over.",
      "Disrupting shipping would be \" a scorched earth possibility, a Sherman-burning-Atlanta move,\u201d Kloza said.",
      "Writing in a report, Ed Yardeni, a long-time analyst, agreed that Tehran leaders would likely hold back.",
      "\u201cThey aren\u2019t crazy,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors Sunday. \u201cThe price of oil should fall and stock markets around the world should climb higher.\u201d",
      "Other experts weren't so sure.",
      "Countries are not always rational actors and Tehran could lash out for political or emotional reasons, said Andy Lipow, a Houston analyst who has covered oil markets for 45 years.",
      "\u201cIf the Strait of Hormuz was completely shut down, oil prices would rise to $120 to $130 a barrel,\u201d Lipow said. That would translate to about $4.50 a gallon at the pump and hurt consumers in other ways, he said.",
      "Much of East Asia depends on oil imported through the strait. Taiwan's Taiex fell 1.4% while the Kospi in South Korea slipped 0.2%.",
      "In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 edged 0.1% lower, with gains for defense contractors, oil companies and miners helping to make up for broad losses.",

      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Oklahoma City's unwavering fans finally get to celebrate a championship after suffering through several close calls and heartbreaking moments the past two decades.",
      "The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers on Sunday to clinch the NBA title, and the city will hold a parade on Tuesday morning to honor its first major professional championship. Finals MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, All-Star Jalen Williams and their teammates will pass through downtown for an event that is scheduled to last 90 minutes.",
      "Oklahoma City first hosted an NBA team during the 2005-06 season, when the New Orleans Hornets temporarily relocated after Hurricane Katrina. Oklahoma City\u2019s fans fell in love with the team and a young point guard named Chris Paul who would be named rookie of the year.",
      "The Seattle SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City in time for the 2008-09 season, and fans feverishly supported the team, despite its early struggles. The Thunder became contenders with young stars Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden.",
      "Even with all that talent, they couldn\u2019t break through. They lost to the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals in 2012, and Harden left for Houston. A possible run in 2013 was derailed when Westbrook was injured during the playoffs. The 2015-16 team led the Golden State Warriors 3-1 in the Western Conference finals before losing the series in seven games.",
      "Durant left to join the Warriors after that season, ending that version of the Thunder. Westbrook was the league MVP in 2017 and averaged a triple-double for three straight seasons, but the Thunder never got out of the first round those years.",
      "But with its new set of superstars, finally, Oklahoma City has its moment.",

      "ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Alex Cora is 0 for 2 in arguing obstruction calls with umpire Alan Porter after the Boston Red Sox manager was ejected Monday night in the fifth inning of a 9-5 loss to the Los Angeles Angels, the second straight game in which Cora was tossed.",
      "Boston was trailing 5-4 when Jarren Duran doubled to lead off the fifth. Abraham Toro grounded to shortstop, but Duran hesitated before breaking for third and was tagged out in a rundown by Angels second baseman Christian Moore.",
      "Moore then spun and threw to second base, where Angels third baseman Luis Rengifo was covering, to nail Toro trying to advance. Cora argued that Rengifo blocked the bag with his knee and was ejected after a long argument with Porter, who made the out call.",
      "Porter ejected Cora for arguing a similar play in a game against Minnesota last Sept. 22 after Red Sox pitcher Nick Pivetta threw to second baseman Vaughn Grissom in an attempt to pick off Byron Buxton.",
      "Buxton was safe, but the Twins argued that Grissom blocked Buxton\u2019s path to the bag with his knee. The umpires ultimately agreed, and Buxton was awarded third base.",
      "\u201cOur point of view was that he was blocking the bag,\u201d Cora said, referring to Monday night\u2019s play. \u201cI guess the rule is if he\u2019s going to be out easy, they can do that. But we had a similar situation last year with the same (umpiring) crew \u2026 and Alan reversed the call.",
      "\u201cThat was the whole point\u2029I was trying to make \u2014 it happened six months ago, the same situation, and it was reversed. Maybe he\u2019s right, you know, if he was going to be safe, but I wanted to make sure.\u201d",
      "Major League Baseball Rule 6.00(h) awards the base to the runner when the fielder is ruled to have impeded the runner\u2019s progress while not in possession of the ball and not in the act of fielding the ball.",
      "Porter, however, told a pool reporter there was an extenuating circumstance \u2014 mainly, that Moore\u2019s throw arrived well before Toro, who was out by several feet, essentially making an obstruction call moot.",
      "\u201cDid the fielder obstruct, or was the runner just out?\u201d Porter said. \u201cWe felt that the runner, no matter what the fielder had done in that situation, was out. He was out by a lot. And that\u2019s part of also not calling the obstruction.",
      "\u201cAnd the other side of it is that it\u2019s a very quick developing play there. So we\u2019re able to give them a little bit of leeway when they don\u2019t have time to set up because it was the rundown, and (Rengifo) is running back (toward second base).\u201d",
      "Cora wasn\u2019t around to see the Angels score four runs in the eighth to snap a 5-all tie, but he saw enough of Walker Buehler\u2019s shaky start to acknowledge the veteran right-hander might be losing his grip on a rotation spot.",
      "Handed a 3-0 lead before he took the mound, Buehler walked four and hit two batters during a five-run first inning in which he threw 39 pitches. He finished with a career-high seven walks in four innings.",
      "The Red Sox rallied to tie the score in the sixth, taking Buehler off the hook for a loss, but he is 5-5 with a 6.29 ERA in 13 starts. In his previous outing, he gave up eight runs and eight hits over 3 1/3 innings in a loss at Seattle last week.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t walk seven guys in a major league baseball game and expect to be successful,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cI think we keep trying different things and looking at different stuff, this (pitch) mix or that mix, but at the end of the day, if you don\u2019t execute and throw strikes, you really don\u2019t have a chance.",
      "\u201cI feel like a broken record. It\u2019s embarrassing. It\u2019s not who I want to be as a baseball player, obviously. I\u2019d rather get whacked around than do that.\u201d",
      "Buehler struggled in his return from a second Tommy John surgery last season, going 1-6 with a 5.95 ERA in 16 starts for the Los Angeles Dodgers, but he recovered in October to play an integral part in the team\u2019s run to a World Series title. He even came out of the bullpen to get the final three outs of the series-clinching win over the New York Yankees.",
      "Asked if he was sure Buehler is healthy, Cora said: \u201cOne hundred percent.\u201d When Buehler was asked if he's pitching through anything right now, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201d",
      "Buehler recovered from his brutal first inning to blank the Angels on one hit over his final three frames, perhaps earning a longer leash in the team\u2019s rotation.",
      "\u201cThe second, third and fourth innings were really good,\u201d Cora said. \u201cThe velocity was up and the movement on his pitches were great. There\u2019s a few things mechanically that he feels he needs to do better, but he\u2019ll be ready for the next one.\u201d",
      "Buehler was a postseason star for the Dodgers as they won three National League pennants and a World Series crown from 2017-20. But is he worried about his spot in the Boston rotation?",
      "\u201cYeah, I think you have to be,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cAt some point, there\u2019s 26 guys that are going to help this team hopefully make the playoffs and if you\u2019re not one of them, I don\u2019t really think it matters what you\u2019ve done in years past.",
      "\u201cAt some point, I\u2019ve got to put some results out there for myself, but also for this organization. \u2026 It just sucks, man. I want to contribute to this team so badly. I\u2019ve enjoyed playing here so much outside of my own performance, so it\u2019s just really frustrating.\u201d",

      "LAS VEGAS -- With mounds of dirt, construction vehicles and the exact location where home plate will be at the new A's Ballpark serving as the backdrop Monday morning, team owner John Fisher stood in front of a large gathering with one message: \"We are Vegas' team.\u201d",
      "MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, state and local government dignitaries, former Athletics greats such as Rollie Fingers and Dave Stewart, Little Leaguers and many others looked on as the team celebrated the groundbreaking of a $1.75 billion, 33,000-person capacity ballpark that is expected to be finished in time for the 2028 season.",
      "Nevada and Clark County have approved up to $380 million in public funds for the project.",
      "\u201cI have no doubt this is done in 2028,\u201d team president Marc Badain said. \"You know the workforce here; they\u2019re all here and ready to get going.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see the validation a day like today brings and what the next three years will mean for the community and for the construction project and the jobs and everything else that you\u2019re going to see as this building comes out of the ground starting as early as tonight.\u201d",
      "Badain went through a similar process when serving in the same capacity for the NFL's Raiders. He was a central figure in that team\u2019s move from Oakland to Las Vegas in 2020 as well as the approval and construction of $2 billion Allegiant Stadium.",
      "While waiting for Allegiant Stadium to be finished, the Raiders remained in Oakland for three seasons in the stadium they shared with the A's. But while the Raiders maintained a largely strong connection to the Bay Area even while playing as a lameduck franchise, A's fans were incensed about their team's impending departure and the process involved.",
      "That made staying in Oakland untenable for the franchise, which played its final season in the dilapidated stadium last year. The A's are playing the first of at least three years about an hour away at a Triple-A ballpark in West Sacramento, California, while they await their move to Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cWe are a local team,\u201d Fisher said. \"And we want to start from the youngest of fans, because if you can get the kids, you can get their parents. It takes less time than you think; what really takes time is ... to have a winner.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to continue to build upon what we have, and building a team is like building anything else. Sometimes it takes more time than you want it to. It\u2019s like building the stadium. And we think that we have the pieces to make ourselves really successful.\u201d",
      "The stadium will be built on nine acres of the 35-acre site owned by Bally\u2019s on the corner of Tropicana Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard. The Tropicana\u2019s resort towers were destroyed in an overnight demolition in October to clear the way for the ballpark.",
      "The A's are trying to strike a balance of making the most of their temporary home while also preparing for their future. Each A's player wears a patch of Sacramento's Tower Bridge on one sleeve and a Las Vegas logo on the other as part of a three-year sponsorship with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.",
      "The Las Vegas Stadium Authority in December approved lease, non-relocation and development documents, the last major steps for the A's to eventually become Las Vegas' team.",
      "Artist renderings show a stadium with its five overlapping layers that bears a striking resemblance to Australia's famed Sydney Opera House.

    "summary": "Haoxi Simon Wang was 12 when he left his family behind in Beijing to move to Toronto and pursue his passion to play hockey",
    "story": [
      "Haoxi Simon Wang was 12 when he left his family behind in Beijing to move to Toronto and pursue his passion to play hockey",
      "Invited to watch his first hockey practice at an ice rink in Beijing, Haoxi Wang was no different than any impressionable, wide-eyed 4-year-old being fascinated by the equipment the players wore.",
      "They resembled superheroes with sticks, uniforms and bulging pads, their faces hidden behind helmeted cages. This was before the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, when hockey was a niche sport in China and the NHL a mere pipe dream.",
      "\u201cIt was definitely the gear,\u201d the 6-foot-5, 215-pound \u2014 and still growing \u2014 defenseman who goes by Simon recalled at the NHL pre-draft scouting combine in Buffalo earlier this month.",
      "\u201cSomething just clicked inside of me, and I just fell in love with the game,\u201d Wang added. \u201cRight away, I told my mom I need to get out there as soon as possible. And I probably went on the ice the next day or so.\u201d",
      "This marked the start of a journey that saw a 12-year-old Wang move to Toronto and work his way up the junior ranks to play for the OHL Oshawa Generals. At 17, he is considered a candidate to be an early to mid-round pick in the NHL draft in Los Angeles this weekend.",
      "\u201cI think this is a dream come true moment for me,\u201d said Wang, ranked 34th on NHL Central Scouting\u2019s list of North American skaters. \u201cIf I told myself four, five years ago that I\u2019ll be here, the NHL combine, I\u2019d probably tell myself I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s not.",
      "Based on Wang\u2019s size and skating ability, there\u2019s likely to be even more pinch-me moments ahead for someone in position to become just the third Chinese-born player \u2014 and potentially highest \u2014 selected in the NHL draft.",
      "Andong Song, chosen 172nd overall by the New York Islanders in 2015, was the first Chinese-born player drafted. Song never played professionally following two seasons with the USHL's Madison Capitols.",
      "Then there\u2019s Kevin He, also from Beijing, who is on path to playing in the NHL. Drafted 109th by Winnipeg last year, He signed a three-year entry level contract with the Jets in December.",
      "Kevin He had the advantage of playing organized hockey at 6 when his family moved to Montreal. By comparison, Wang\u2019s true introduction to the sport competitively came with his arrival in Toronto at the urging of a friend who made the move earlier to pursue hockey.",
      "It was a culture shock for Wang, who left his family behind and couldn't speak English.",
      "\u201cI think courage would be the word, I would describe it,\u201d Oshawa general manager Roger Hunt said. \u201cThe only language he knew was hockey. And he wanted to play. And he had the vision at that age to say, \u2018Hey, if I want to do this, I better go there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Wang proved to be a quick study. Though raw, his ability almost immediately caught everyone\u2019s attention.",
      "The only question for Hunt in selecting Wang in the fifth round of the 2023 OHL 16-year-old draft was his eligibility in having already committed to Boston University. The NCAA previously barred CHL players from competing at the college ranks before eliminating its rule in November.",
      "Wang made his debut with Oshawa in December. Though he finished with a modest five assists in 53 games on a team that lost to London in the OHL finals, Wang did not look out of place.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would have went into that arena and said, \u2018Hey, this kid\u2019s only played hockey five years,\u2019\u201d Hunt said. \u201cHe\u2019s got such good feet, he skates so well, his edges, everything.\u201d",
      "Next year, Hunt projects Wang to take on a larger role as Oshawa's top defenseman. Wang is ahead of schedule, in part due to the NCAA rule change.",
      "The initial plan last season, his agent John Walters said, was to have Wang stay in the OJHL, where he was already showing signs of dominating with four goals and 22 points in 38 games.",
      "Walters said it was at Wang\u2019s urging to make the jump to OHL to spur his development against better competition.",
      "\u201cI had a couple of NHL teams saying, \u2018You should have left him in junior, because there would have been that wonderment about him.\u2019 And I said, \u2018But that wouldn\u2019t have made him better,'\u201d Walters said. \u201cSimon doesn\u2019t care whether he goes in the first, second or third round. He wants to get better. He needed to go challenge himself.\u201d",
      "It was Walters who took Wang under his wing early after his arrival in Canada, with Walters\u2019 father chauffeuring the player to practices and games. Another benefit was Wang\u2019s mother, Willa, who was so inspired by her son\u2019s passion for hockey, she became an ice-rink developer in China and she eventually purchased the Ontario Junior Hockey League team where her son played.",
      "The plan for Wang now is to compete in the OHL next season before making the jump to Boston University, where his older brother completed his post-graduate studies.",
      "\u201cWhen I was 12, I had a very naive belief in me that I\u2019m going to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here right now and not taking any moment for granted. I\u2019m still learning, and I might be still behind a lot of guys, but my potential and what I can become as a player, that\u2019s what\u2019s really exciting about me.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m excited for the next part of my story,\" Mullin told Wigan's official website on Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve scored a lot of goals over the last few years, but more than anything, I give my absolute all for the club that I\u2019m playing for, and I\u2019m going to do that again with Wigan.\u201d",
      "Wigan said the loan deal was subject to the approval of the English Football League and the Football Association, and international clearance.",

      "\u201cWe are requesting a five-year prison sentence for the proven crime of sexual abuse against a minor,\u201d said prosecutor Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez.",
      "The prosecutors also requested that Wander be sentenced to prison in Puerto Plata and that the minor\u2019s mother be sentenced to 10 years in prison, arguing she sexually trafficked her daughter.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- During its rise as a national power in the 1990s, LSU built its identity on prodigious home run numbers, a style coined \u201cGorilla Ball.\u201d",
      "The game changed over the decades, and so did the Tigers. They still have plenty of offense, but pitching is the name of the game in the bayou nowadays.",
      "LSU's pitching prowess was omnipresent in the College World Series as the Tigers won their second national championship in three years with a two-game sweep of Coastal Carolina in the finals.",
      "The Tigers posted a CWS-best 2.60 ERA over five games, and opponents batted .205 and just .145 with runners in scoring position.",

      "The Tigers have maintained consistency on the mound even though they've had three pitching coaches in four years. The first was Jason Kelly, who left to become head coach at Washington. Wes Johnson was in charge in 2023 and left to become head coach at Georgia. Nate Yeskie just finished his second year after being hired away from Texas A&M.",
      "\u201cHe always says he\u2019s coaching us for the player he thinks we\u2019re going to be rather than the player we are right now,\" Shores said. \u201cSo just holding us to the higher standard just allows us to go out there and just work really hard and do our job.\u201d",

      "The concept has already juiced enthusiasm in NASCAR to levels not seen since the halcyon days when Donnie Allison and Cale Yarborough duked it out in the 1979 Daytona 500.",
      "\u201cTo be really honest with you,\u201d 2020 NASCAR champion Chase Elliott said, \u201cI have not paid any attention to it.\u201d",
      "Maybe a look at the matchup will get NASCAR\u2019s most popular driver pumped!",
      "Elliott is seeded fifth against No. 28 seed Austin Dillon in the first round of the head-to-head showdown in the race-within-the-race set for this weekend at the track better known as Atlanta Motor Speedway.",

      "NASCAR is set to start the engines on a five-race, bracket-style tournament called the In-Season Challenge in the midst of the summer slate, which comes with a $1 million prize to the winner.",
      "The final 32-driver field was set by results of the last three races at Michigan, Mexico City and Pocono. The drivers are paired in head-to-head matchups based on seeding, with the winners advancing to the next round in a bracket format that mirrors the NCAA basketball tournaments.",
      "Buoyed by a win at Michigan and a runner-up finish at Pocono, Denny Hamlin earned the top seed. He\u2019ll square off \u2014 race off? \u2014 against No. 32 seed Ty Dillon. Pocono winner Chase Briscoe is the No. 2 seed and is pitted against No. 31 seed Noah Gragson.",
      "Chris Buescher is third, Christopher Bell fourth and Elliott fifth, among notable names.",
      "The format is single elimination with the field cut to 16 at the street race in Chicago, eight at Sonoma, four on the lone concrete track in the series at Dover and the final two over the yard of bricks at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.",
      "The Challenge is part of NASCAR\u2019s media rights deal that includes TNT, and the Atlanta-based cable network will broadcast all five races in the tournament, starting with the 400-miler in Atlanta.",
      "Aside from a shrug from Elliott and a few others, drivers are intrigued by the idea of increasing the stakes in each race beyond a playoff berth, trophy and the winner\u2019s purse.",
      "\u201cI love it. I think it\u2019s great,\u201d three-time Cup champion Joey Logano said. \u201cI think it\u2019s placed perfectly where it is in the season. This is kind of that moment where the newness is worn off. We\u2019re into the rhythm, we\u2019re racing every week. It\u2019s starting to start a little bit of, who\u2019s going to be in the playoffs, who\u2019s not, the cutoff line all those types of things. But it\u2019s not really the main story quite yet.\u201d",
      "Stories are what sell, of course, and the sizzle in Pocono over the weekend had little to do with which drivers or teams are the ones to beat for the 2025 championship. Rather, it was whether two pedestrian drivers were going to fight, the end of Amazon Prime's run of wildly-popular telecasts and Hall of Fame driver Dale Earnhardt Jr.\u2019s win in his first race as a crew chief.",
      "\u201cThis really spices up the mid-part of the season,\u201d Logano said.",
      "So does placing a few bucks on No. 11 to win.",
      "But as of Monday afternoon, most sports gambling sites did not offer odds on specific matchups headed into Atlanta. NASCAR is offering $1 million to a winning fan with a perfect bracket in its fantasy game.",
      "There are some quirks to the bracket: Shane van Gisbergen won the Cup race in Mexico City and is not in the field while series points leader William Byron is only a No. 9 seed. The tournament boasts matchups in the first-round of past Cup champions (Kyle Busch-Brad Keselowski), former teammates (Briscoe-Gragson), and even best friends (Bubba Wallace-Daniel Suarez).",
      "The idea for the challenge was largely championed by Hamlin, a three-time Daytona 500 champion who floated the idea of a mid-season tournament on his \u201cActions Detrimental\" podcast. When NASCAR bought into the idea and announced the creation of the tournament last year, Hamlin called the tournament on social media \u201csuch a win for our sport and drivers.\u201d He jokingly added, \u201cI will collect my 1M royalty next season.\u201d",
      "Hamlin's on deck and clearly a favorite to win it all, with three wins this year for Joe Gibbs Racing and the top seed.",
      "(And let's not haggle over who gets credit in court.)",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a sports guy, so I\u2019m going to be engaged with it,\" Hamlin said. \"I\u2019ll know who I will have to beat next week. I\u2019ve told the team, we are going to try and do what we can. We are going to be up against it because we are going to tracks that aren\u2019t very favorable to me. But we are going to try to do our best to beat that one car for the next four to five weeks.\u201d",
      "NASCAR will present the tournament winner at Indianapolis with a ring, jackets, trophy and \u2014 oh yeah, a million bucks.",
      "That's enough cash to get anyone's attention \u2014 even Elliott's.",

      "The first female and first African president of the IOC, Kirsty Coventry, was inaugurated in the role on Monday",
      "LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- The first female and first African president of the IOC, Kirsty Coventry, was inaugurated in the role Monday on the organization's 131st birthday with praise that the Olympic movement was \u201cin the best of hands.\u201d",
      "Coventry, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming for Zimbabwe, finally and formally takes office Tuesday aged just 41 after decisively winning a seven-candidate election in March to succeed Thomas Bach.",
      "Coventry cited her family including her two young daughters as \u201cmy rocks, my inspiration\u201d to lead the International Olympic Committee through the next eight years including the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cYou are my constant reminders of why we do what we do every single day,\u201d Coventry said, addressing six-year-old Ella seated near the front of the ceremony",
      "\u201cYou are a constant reminder of why this movement is relevant, why it needs to change, why we need to embrace the new ways,\u201d the new president said. \u201cAnd you will be a constant reminder for many years to come on the decisions that we all take together.\u201d",
      "She thanked her husband, Tyrone Seward, because \"you have always stood by my side and never said \u2018No.\u2019 And I appreciate that because that is something that doesn\u2019t come very often.\u201d",
      "Coventry, a former swim team standout at Auburn University, said Olympic leaders were \"guardians of a platform ... to inspire, to change lives, to bring hope.\u201d",
      "Bach\u2019s voice had cracked with emotion minutes earlier as he handed over a symbolic key to the presidency to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Olympic politics.",

      "\u201cI believe with all my heart that the Olympic movement is ready for the future,\u201d said Bach, adding he had \u201cgiven all I could\u201d to the IOC and the games.",
      "The ceremony took place in a temporary building in the gardens of Olympic House designed in the style of the Grand Palais in Paris that hosted fencing and taekwondo at the Summer Games last year.",
      "A steamy, humid day at the IOC\u2019s lakeside modern headquarters saw a sudden downpour of rain minutes before the scheduled start. It forced Bach and Coventry to shelter under a shared umbrella as they walked from the villa that was the former Olympic home.",
      "The hour-long ceremony included a four-minute montage of tributes to Bach, who now becomes the IOC\u2019s honorary president. He has expressed a wish to counsel his successor.",
      "Coventry\u2019s first day at the office will feature a closed-door session to hear the views of around 100 IOC members. They include current and former heads of state, business leaders and billionaires, past and current Olympic athletes, plus leaders of Olympic sports.",
      "In a team photo taken after the handover ceremony, the IOC member who stayed closest to Coventry was Nita Ambani, a member of the richest family in India who is key to the country's ambitions to host the 2036 Olympics.",
      "Picking the host shapes as one of the biggest decisions during the new president's first term. Asia seems favored and Middle East neighbors Qatar and Saudi Arabia also are preparing bids in the more flexible and unpredictable process that lets the IOC fast-track a preferred option to avoid a contested vote.",
      "A theme of Coventry's election opponents \u2014 including one of her four IOC vice presidents, Juan Antonio Samaranch \u2014 was the members' wish to be more involved in consultation and decision-making after Bach's hands-on presidency. Their first chance to air views comes Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt's an important step to listen and to give people the opportunity to talk,\" William Blick, a member from Uganda, told The Associated Press while welcoming the powerful symbol of electing a first IOC leader from Africa who also was a young woman. \"It\u2019s a very good way for her to start.\u201d",

      "The promise came three years ago from Oklahoma City general manager Sam Presti",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- The promise came three years ago from Oklahoma City general manager Sam Presti. It might have been overlooked for a couple of reasons. One, the Thunder were awful at the time. Two, he was speaking Latin.",
      "\u201cLabor omnia vincit,\u201d Presti said after the 2021-22 season, quoting a motto of Oklahoma. Depending on how Presti was translating it, it could have been \u201chard work conquers all\u201d or \u201cslow work conquers all.\u201d",
      "Either way, it applies to the Thunder. They did hard work. They did slow work.",
      "They conquered all.",
      "The Thunder \u2014 three years removed from winning 24 games \u2014 won 84 games this season and are NBA champions after beating the Indiana Pacers in a seven-game NBA Finals slugfest. For the rest of the NBA, this should be a scary development. They have the MVP in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He and all of Oklahoma City\u2019s key players are under contract for next season, there\u2019s a 2024 lottery pick in Nikola Topic who didn\u2019t even play this season because of a torn ACL and the Thunder currently have two picks in the top 24 in this year\u2019s draft as well.",
      "They are young; their starters, right now, are 27, 26, 26, 24 and 23. They are bold. And they might \u2014 should \u2014 be contending for a while.",
      "\u201cWe definitely still have room to grow,\u201d said Gilgeous-Alexander, the MVP, the NBA Finals MVP, the league\u2019s scoring champion and now, an NBA champion as well. \u201cThat\u2019s the fun part of this. So many of us can still get better. There\u2019s not very many of us on the team that are in our prime or even close to it. We have a lot to grow, individually and as a group. I\u2019m excited for the future of this team. This is a great start, for sure.\u201d",
      "And the timing of them hitting this sort of stride is pretty good, too.",
      "Plenty of teams have questions going into next season. Oklahoma City isn\u2019t one of them. Jayson Tatum in Boston, Damian Lillard in Milwaukee and now Tyrese Haliburton in Indiana all have Achilles injuries and figure to miss most if not all of next season. The Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 LeBron James will be going into his 23rd season. Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry is turning 38 next season. Kevin Durant, now of Houston (in a trade that\u2019s going to be official in the coming weeks), is going into his 18th season. Philadelphia\u2019s hopes hinge on Joel Embiid coming back healthy. New York will be dealing with a coaching change.",
      "Oklahoma City seems to have everything right in place.",
      "\u201cThey have a lot of great players on this team,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said.",
      "Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren all seem to enjoy playing with and off one another, none of them caring who gets credit. Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein fit seamlessly into the roles the Thunder asked them to play. Luguentz Dort is a defensive machine and has come to realize that most people don\u2019t have the ability to appreciate how good he is at that end.",
      "It\u2019s not just the players who don\u2019t care about puffing out their own chests. Same goes for the leadership.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not guaranteed anything in the league,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest thing that happens year to year that people forget about. Any moment your team can change with a trade, with an injury, with something that\u2019s out of your control. To be able to get to the pinnacle of this sport and win it is nothing short of extraordinary. To think that you can just walk in and do it every single year is a little bit na\u00efve. Rest assured, we\u2019ll show up Day 1 next year ready to get better and ready to chase this again.\u201d",
      "Presti, the architect of it all, rarely speaks publicly. Same goes for Clay Bennett, the owner. And coach Mark Daigneault is the calm in the eye of any storm, the perfect driver of the Thunder bus.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee you end it the way that we did,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cI just wanted it so bad for them. I was just so thrilled that we were able to get that done and they get to experience this because they deserve it. The way they approach it, the professionalism, competitiveness, team-first nature, like I said, I wanted it so bad for them.\u201d",
      "The journey isn\u2019t over for the Thunder. It\u2019s just starting. Presti has a war chest filled with draft picks and the team has some financial flexibility to add a piece if it so chooses. And now there\u2019s a title to defend.",
      "Labor omnia vincit. There\u2019s more work to do.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of hard work in front of us,\u201d Presti said that day in 2022. \u201cWe have to grind in and do it. That\u2019s what the state is about. That\u2019s what the history of the community is about. That\u2019s what the basketball team here is about.\u201d",

      "A year ago the Baltimore Orioles looked like a dynasty in the making.",
      "Since then, they've been thoroughly mediocre, and even an improved stretch recently hasn't helped their outlook much for 2025.",
      "After losing two of three to the Yankees in New York, the Orioles are 11 games under .500. They've gone 17-10 over their last 27, so perhaps the worst is over, but over the last 162 regular-season games, Baltimore is 75-87. It's a remarkable decline for a team that won 101 games in 2023, started 49-25 last year and had a core of standouts that was young and cost controlled.",
      "Injuries have been a major factor, with catcher and former No. 1 overall draft pick Adley Rutschman the latest big name to go on the IL. Right-hander Grayson Rodriguez hasn't pitched at all this year. Zach Eflin has made only 11 starts with a 5.46 ERA, and outfielder Colton Cowser and infielder Jordan Westburg have missed significant time as well.",
      "The front office has received little sympathy following an offseason in which ace Corbin Burnes departed and the Orioles replaced him with stopgap solutions on one-year deals.",
      "Although Baltimore is just 6 1/2 games out of a postseason spot, FanGraphs isn't a believer, giving the Orioles just a 3.7% chance of making the playoffs. Baltimore is one of five 2024 postseason participants that would miss out if this season ended today. Here are the others:",
      "SAN DIEGO (42-35 record, 39.3% postseason chance according to FanGraphs): The Padres are a half-game behind resurgent Milwaukee for the last spot in the National League playoffs. San Diego has been treading water since a 23-11 start, and its division just became more interesting after San Francisco acquired Rafael Devers.",
      "CLEVELAND (39-37, 34.1%): The Guardians are tied for the final American League spot but would lose a head-to-head tiebreaker to Seattle if the season ended now. Detroit has opened an 8 1/2-game lead in the AL Central, so unless Cleveland can cut into that significantly, it'll be a wild card or bust for the Guardians down the stretch.",
      "ATLANTA (35-41, 27.3%): The talent is there, but this past week was typical for the 2025 Braves, who followed up a three-game sweep of the Mets by losing two of three to Miami.",
      "KANSAS CITY (38-40, 20.0%): Bobby Witt Jr. can only do so much \u2014 only the Pirates have scored fewer runs than the Royals. But the bar in the AL is low, and Kansas City can probably stay in the mix.",
      "In honor of the NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder, name the five current major league franchises that have won the World Series in multiple cities.",
      "Clarke Schmidt threw seven hitless innings for the New York Yankees on Saturday in their 9-0 win over Baltimore. The Orioles managed only one hit on the day \u2014 against the New York bullpen.",
      "The Orioles led 8-0 in the third inning at Tampa Bay on Wednesday before the Rays stormed back to win 12-8. Tampa Bay had a 2% chance to win at the start of the third according to Baseball Savant.",
      "Yennier Cano allowed four runs in the fifth to tie the game, and he was sent down to the minors later in the week. Andrew Kittredge then allowed four in the seventh.",
      "That's the issue for the Orioles. Will their pitching allow the kind of hot streak they'd need to jump back into the playoff race?",
      "The Athletics (Philadelphia and Oakland), Braves (Boston, Milwaukee and Atlanta), Dodgers (Brooklyn and Los Angeles), Giants (New York and San Francisco) and Twins (Washington and Minnesota).",

      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Matt Freese's gaffe that cost the U.S. the lead in a CONCACAF Gold Cup group play finale drew a reaction from coach Mauricio Pochettino that Americans can apply to the rest of their last competitive test before next year's World Cup.",
      "\u201cMove on,\u201d Pochettino said of the goalkeeper's botched clearing attempt before Patrick Agyemang's tiebreaking 75th-minute goal in a 2-1 victory over Haiti on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cRemember, the most important action is the next one,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIf you think in the last one like that, you\u2019re going to do another mistake. This type of accident happened, and it will happen it the future.\u201d",
      "The immediate future for the U.S. after a 3-0 run through Group D is a quarterfinal against Costa Rica or Mexico next weekend. Either way, the opponent will be ranked higher than any of th group opponents.",
      "The U.S. ended a four-match losing streak by beating No. 100 Trinidad and Tobago 5-0 in its Gold Cup opener, followed by a 1-0 victory over 58th-ranked Saudi Arabia. Haiti is No. 83.",
      "\u201cThe confidence level is super high,\u201d said Brenden Aaronson, who assisted on Malik Tillman's goal that opened the scoring in the 10th minute. \u201cI mean, nine points from three games. We\u2019ve had two shutouts and another win today against a good Haiti team. I think we\u2019re really flying at the moment. Now we have a week to prepare, which we haven\u2019t had for any team.\u201d",
      "Still, the play has been uneven from what amounts to a B team of mostly young and unproven players and A team backups. Several of the usual stars and starters sat out for personal reasons, injuries or playing in the Club World Cup.",
      "Missing the tournament for the U.S. are regulars Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna, Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun and Sergi\u00f1o Dest.",
      "\u201cWe were not a clinic with the chances that we had,\u201d Pochettino said of the Haiti win. \u201cI think we should have scored more.\u201d",
      "Freese blundered when took a back pass from Tim Ream and tried to play the ball to John Tolkin with his left foot. The ball went straight to Louicius Don Deedson, who took a touch and scored inside the far post for a 1-1 tie in the 19th minute.",
      "The unsightly moment did nothing to dissuade Pochettino, who suggested his decision to go with Freese over Matt Turner will continue in this Gold Cup. The coach thought Freese followed orders by moving on.",
      "\u201cContinues to build me up,\u201d Freese said of Pochettino. \u201cThat\u2019s something I really appreciate. Very grateful for the opportunity. I just want to help the team win as much as I can.\u201d",
      "The U.S. won its group for the 17th time in 18 Gold Cups. The Americans have 43 wins, one loss and five draws in group play, going 3-0 for the seventh time. Still, a four-match losing streak punctuated by a Switzerland's 4-0 blowout in the final Gold Cup tune-up is a not-very-distant memory.",
      "\u201cTo be the best, you\u2019ve got to beat the best,\u201d Freese said. \u201cI think always continuing to push ourselves and play against harder teams and show what we can do and learn from it and continue to grow as a group ahead of a big summer next summer is an opportunity we\u2019re all looking forward to. We want to continue to move on.\u201d",

      "CROMWELL, Conn. -- J.J. Spaun knows as well as anyone how one little shot can make such a huge difference, even if it's only 85 yards to a green in the shape of a red umbrella floating in the middle of a lake.",
      "It wasn't a shot that won the U.S. Open. Spaun will be remembered far more for the driver he hit onto the 17th green at Oakmont to take the lead, and for the 65-foot putt on the last hole to cap off his sensational birdie-birdie finish at golf's toughest test.",
      "This shot was five years ago at the Travelers Championship. It was no less important to Spaun, who has Type 1 diabetes but didn't know it at the time.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Andy Bessette, the executive vice president and chief administrative officer at Travelers Insurance, and a familiar face behind the tournament. \u201cNot everything in life is for a reason, but at times you have to step back and think it's too weird it happened that way.\u201d",
      "A 15-year tradition at the Travelers is \u201cThe Umbrella at 15 1/2 Challenge,\u201d where players during the pro-am hit an 85-yard shot at the umbrella that sits in the lake between the 15th and 16th holes at the TPC River Highland. The closest to the pin is given $10,000 to donate to charity.",
      "It was in 2020 when Spaun \u2014 who had been misdiagnosed with Type 2 diabetes some 18 months earlier \u2014 hit his lob wedge to 19 inches to win the challenge.",
      "The charity of his choice: The Junior Diabetes Research Foundation, now known as Breakthrough T1D.",
      "\u201cWhen Travelers got word of where I wanted that donation to go, Andy Bessette kind of broke down apparently and was touched very deeply because he's a very integral part of that charity and donates quite a lot of money, too,\u201d Spaun said. \u201cSo that initiated our connection.\u201d",
      "Bessette's son, Chris, was was diagnosed with Type 1 in 2011 at age 18. They are deeply connected with Breakthrough T1D, and when he heard where Spaun directed his donation, the Bessette family immediately matched it.",
      "So began a relationship that became more valuable than Spaun could have imagined.",
      "Even after the initial diagnosis of Type 2 in the fall of 2018, Spaun kept losing weight and energy. Something wasn't right and he knew it.",
      "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin. Type 2 is more common, mainly affect adults. The body doesn't make enough insulin and is often managed with lifestyle changes, such as diet.",
      "Once doctors got the diagnosis right in 2021, Spaun still struggled to find the right treatment for someone who spends five hours or more on the golf course. On one occasion, his close friend Harold Varner III noticed something off and encouraged to tap into Bessette's resources.",
      "\u201cWe called him together, Harold and I, and I said, \u2018J.J., anything you need, you tell me.\u2019 He told me what was going on. It was about getting the right kind of care,\" Bessette said.",
      "In this case, it was a new product that allowed insulin to be inhaled instead of injections, far easier to manage on the course. Bessette also connected him with a doctor in Los Angeles who worked with athletes on how to handle blood sugar levels.",
      "\u201cHe is very well connected with the diabetes community, so all these doctors were at my disposal,\u201d Spaun said.",
      "A tough road is nothing new to Spaun. He was a walk-on at San Diego State. He spent three years on developmental circuits before reaching the PGA Tour. He had to go back to the Korn Ferry Tour, fell as low as No. 584 in the world ranking in 2021 and won for the first time a year later at the Texas Open.",
      "Spaun has dips in form, as most golfers do. He was worried a year ago about losing his card until he pulled it together late last year. He was getting closer, losing in a playoff at The Players Championship to Rory McIlroy, before his epic breakthrough at Oakmont.",
      "It resonated in some corners more than others.",
      "\u201cIt was awesome to see him have the week he had,\u201d said Eric Cole, who also has Type 1 diabetes and has risen from the mini-tours to play in six of the last seven majors. \u201cIt's cool to see diabetes doesn't slow him down. He has a lot of extra stuff to deal with behind the scenes.\u201d",
      "Imagine the thrill for Bessette when he watched Spaun overcome a misdiagnosis and manage Type 1 diabetes to handle the highest pressure in the game. Bessette can relate. He qualified as a hammer thrower for the 1980 Olympics that the U.S. boycotted.",
      "\u201cI think this is one of the most amazing achievements in sport for somebody who has Type 1, whose sugar levels are up and down, trying to keep them under control and win the U.S. Open,\u201d Bessette said. \u201cAre you kidding me? It's brutal competition for four days. I told him, \u2018I\u2019m amazed by what you did.'\"",
      "Spaun returned to the Travelers Championship this year with an empty tank. He said blood sugar levels crashed hard after he won at Oakmont, from the battle on the back nine but more from the emotion and celebration and all the media obligations that followed.",

    "story": [
      "Indiana Pacers fans arrived at Gainbridge Fieldhouse ready to celebrate their first NBA title",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- The gasp inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse was followed quickly by a hush Sunday night.",
      "Just seven minutes into Game 7 of the NBA Finals, the Indiana Pacers' roaring fans went silent, struggling to fathom what they were watching \u2014 a replay of two-time All-Star Tyrese Haliburton hurting his lower right leg and the anguished look on the face of his father, John.",
      "They didn't wait to hear the diagnosis; they already figured they had it.",
      "\u201cI saw (his Achilles tendon) pop immediately, you could see it kind of explode,\u201d said 37-year-old Nick Poore, a lifelong fan of his hometown team. \u201cTough. I mean it is what it is, life goes on. What else can you do besides take it on the chin, you know?\u201d",
      "Coach Rick Carlisle didn't confirm it was a torn Achilles tendon either during his postgame comments though he noted the team's hearts dropped just like so many inside their home arena.",
      "Of course, Haliburton's teammates tried valiantly to rally without their leader but struggled late in the third quarter and early in the fourth of a 103-91 loss at Oklahoma City, a loss that extended Indiana's title drought to 49 years and left many wondering what's next?",
      "This one may have been the most gut-wrenching of all.",
      "A strained right calf had limited Haliburton to 23 minutes Thursday night, but he scored 14 points and had five assists to help Indiana force Sunday's decisive game. With two more days of rest, Haliburton said he felt better and he was early with three 3-pointers and nine points, his best start in the series.",
      "\u201cTyrese was about to cook, he was going to go off,\u201d Poore said. \u201cThat was tough because you could tell he was bringing it tonight.\u201d",
      "But one wrong step ended Haliburton's night and dashed the hopes of so many Pacers fans who came to celebrate the title they'd longed for.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not what we wanted to see but you know what he\u2019s going to want. He\u2019s going to want this team to continue to fight,\u201d Chris Denari, the Pacers\u2019 television play-by-play announcer told the stunned crowd. \u201cHe is the leader of this team. We know what he\u2019s meant since he arrived from Sacramento and he\u2019s going to need all of our thoughts and prayers, but he's going to want this team to fight and win an NBA title.\u201d",
      "The crowd responded to Denari's plea, cheering raucously for each Pacers basket, defensive stop, Thunder foul or turnover. But the late runs eventually took their toll, quieting fans and sending some home for good after Oklahoma City built a 21-point lead.",
      "Worse, it's yet another potentially cruel chapter in the franchise\u2019s long and painful history.",
      "Since the three-time ABA champion team joined the NBA, it has endured every seemingly imaginable and unimaginable setback: the 1977 telethon that saved the team, the Malice in the Palace that cost Reggie Miller his last title shot, near-misses against LeBron James and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference finals and Boston's sweep in the conference finals last year with the injured Haliburton watching the last two games from the bench.",
      "There\u2019s also the injury history. Since Miller's retirement, Danny Granger, Paul George and Victor Oladipo all appeared poised to be the Pacers next big thing \u2014 only to have their careers derailed by injuries. Now it's Haliburton trying to break the jinx.",
      "\u201cHeartbreaking,\u201d said Vernon Morgan, who has followed the Pacers since George McGinnis played for the ABA team in the early 1970s. \u201cWe're still waiting to see if this (injury) will be a detriment to his career or if he's going to recover from it. I realize he'll be out probably all of next year, but we've been counted out before.\"",
      "How tough has this been on Pacers fans?",
      "Anthony Brehob, age 27, came dressed in a Roy Hibbert jersey and had big expectations and like many who stood in the snaking lines on the city's streets.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m expecting a close game, and I\u2019m really hoping Haliburton pulls it off at the end,\" Brehob said. \"If they lose, it\u2019s going to be a long night.\u201d",
      "The problem now is it's also going to be a long offseason with many questions surrounding Haliburton and what can be expected when he does return.",
      "Carlisle said he expects Haliburton, who was on crutches Sunday night, to make a full recovery. And in a state that loves underdogs so much it's produced both the real-life and Hollywood version of \u201cHoosiers,\" the reality is the future still looks bright.",
      "And that at least is some solace to these fans.",
      "\u201cIt's enough to celebrate,\u201d Morgan said of Indiana's playoff run. \u201cWe pushed them to Game 7 and it's a young team. They'll be back. We've been counted out before, nobody counted on us to make a good story. We'll be back again next year.\u201d",

      "Waymo\u2019s robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service that began earlier this year in Austin",
      "Waymo's robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta on Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber that began earlier this year in Austin.",
      "Waymo's driverless march into Atlanta comes just days after Tesla finally launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, more than five years after CEO Elon Musk brashly promised the electric automaker would quickly overtake Waymo as the leader in autonomous driving technology. Unlike Waymo's robotaxis, Tesla is initially placing a human in the passenger seat of its rival service to take over the vehicle if something goes wrong.",
      "While Tesla is starting with about a dozen supervised robotaxis, Waymo and Uber have dispatched about 100 completely driverless vehicles in Austin less than four months after their partnership began. The expansion into Atlanta keeps the two companies aligned with a road map they laid out last September.",
      "As has been the case in Austin, Waymo's robotaxis in Atlanta will be dispatched through Uber's app. Uber will give customers a choice to request a car operated by a human if they don't want to take a driverless ride. The robotaxis will initially cover a 65-square-mile (168,00-square-kilometers) area within the Atlanta market before expanding to a larger stretch.",
      "Waymo's own ride-hailing app is available in Phoenix, Los Angeles and a steadily expanding swath of the San Francisco Bay Area. Factoring in its partnership with Uber, Waymo is currently providing more than 250,000 paid rides per week \u2014 making it the early frontrunner in the still-nascent robotaxi market.",
      "But competition looms down the road as Musk continues to insist Tesla's robotaxi service will be able to grow quickly and Amazon gears up to bring its Zoox driverless cabs to Las Vegas later this year \u2014 with plans to expand into San Francisco next year. Zoox is also aiming to bring its robotaxi service to Atlanta, although it hasn't set a target date for that yet.",
      "Uber once had ambitions to build robotaxis, but reversed course after a bruising legal battle with Waymo, which alleged the ride-hailing company stole its autonomous technology after poaching one of its engineers. After reaching a $245 million settlement with Waymo, Uber eventually sold its self-driving vehicle division following a 2018 crash that killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona.",
      "Uber then pivoted to robotaxi partnerships to remain competitive as driverless cabs reshape the ride-hailing market. \u201cBy integrating Waymo\u2019s cutting-edge technology into the Uber platform, we\u2019re continuing to make transportation more convenient, sustainable, and reliable,\u201d said Sarfraz Maredia, who oversees Uber's efforts in autonomous driving.",
      "With 18 different robotaxi partnerships in place around the world, Uber says it is on pace to make about 1.5 million annual driverless trips that either transport passengers or deliver food.",

Resilience was descending at a rapid rate of 138 feet (42 meters) per second when contact was lost, and crashed five seconds later, they said.",
      "Bad software caused ispace's first lunar lander to slam into the moon in 2023. Like the latest try, the problem occurred during the final phase of descent.",
      "Of seven moon landing attempts by private outfits in recent years, only one can claim total success: Firefly Aerospace's touchdown of its Blue Ghost lander in March. Blue Ghost launched with Resilience in January, sharing a SpaceX rocket ride from Florida.",
      "Aside from Texas-based Firefly, only five countries have pulled off a successful lunar landing: the Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan. And only the U.S. has put astronauts on the moon, back during NASA's Apollo program more than a half-century ago.",
      "Despite back-to-back losses, ispace is pressing ahead with its third moon landing attempt in 2027, with NASA cooperation, as well as a fourth planned mission. Extra tests and improvements will add as much as 1.5 billion yen (more than $10 million) to the development costs, officials said.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada stressed that his company \u201chas not stepped down in the face of setbacks\" and is looking to regain customers' trust. Outside experts will join the accident review, and ispace will collaborate more closely with the Japanese Space Agency on technical matters.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re firmly taking the next step toward our future missions,\u201d he said in Japanese.",

    "story": [
      "Although women face the threat of more injury risks in vehicle crashes, the crash test dummies used in U.S. safety tests are designed almost entirely around the body of a man",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn had one lingering question about the car crash that forced her to have emergency surgery during a vacation in Ireland: Why did she and her mother sustain serious injuries while her father and brother, who sat in the front, emerge unscathed?",
      "\u201cIt was a head-on crash and they were closest to the point of contact,\" said Kuhn, now 25, who missed a semester of college to recover from the 2019 collision that caused her seat belt to slide off her hips and rupture her intestines by pinning them against her spine. \"That was an early clue that something else was going on.\u201d",
      "When Kuhn returned home to Maine, she found an article her grandma had clipped from Consumer Reports and left on her bed. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a frontal crash, she learned, yet the dummy used in vehicle tests  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dates back to the 1970s and is still modeled almost entirely off the body of a man.",
      "Kuhn, who is starting law school at New York University this fall, took action and founded the nonprofit Drive US Forward. Its aim was to raise public awareness and eventually encourage members of Congress to sign onto a bill that would require NHTSA to incorporate a more advanced female dummy into its testing.",
      "The agency has the final word on whether cars get pulled from the market, and the kind of dummy used in its safety tests could impact which ones receive coveted five-star ratings.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we have an easy solution here where we can have crash test dummies that reflect an average woman as well as a man,\u201d Sen. Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who has introduced the legislation the past two sessions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Senators from both parties have signed onto Fischer's \u201cShe Drives Act,\u201d and the transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for updating the rules.",
      "But for various reasons, the push for new safety requirements has been moving at a sluggish pace. That's particularly true in the U.S., where much of the research is happening and where around 40,000 people are killed each year in car crashes.",
      "The crash test dummy currently used in NHTSA five-star testing is called the Hybrid III, which was developed in 1978 and modeled after a 5-foot-9, 171-pound man (the average size in the 1970s but about 29 pounds lighter than today's average). What's known as the female dummy is essentially a much smaller version of the male model with a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger seat or the back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t do is design a crash test dummy that has all the sensors in the areas where a woman would be injured differently than a man,\u201d said Christopher O'Connor, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Humanetics Group, which has spent more than a decade developing and refining one.",
      "A female dummy from Humanetics equipped with all of the available sensors costs around $1 million, about twice the cost of the Hybrid used now.",
      "But, O'Connor says, the more expensive dummy far more accurately reflects the anatomical differences between the sexes \u2014 including in the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs, which one NHTSA study found account for about 80% more injuries by women in a car crash compared to men.",
      "Such physical dummies will always be needed for vehicle safety tests, and to verify the accuracy of virtual tests, O'Connor said.",
      "Europe incorporated the more advanced male dummy developed by Humanetics' engineers, the THOR 50M (based on a 50th percentile man), into its testing procedures soon after Kuhn's 2019 crash in Ireland. Several other countries, including China and Japan, have adopted it as well.",
      "But that model and the female version the company uses for comparison, the THOR 5F (based on a 5th percentile woman), have been met with skepticism from some American automakers who argue the more sophisticated devices may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Bridget Walchesky, 19, had to be flown to a hospital, where she required eight surgeries over a month, after a 2022 crash near her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, that killed her friend, who was driving. While acknowledging the seat belt likely saved her life, Walchesky said some of the injuries \u2014 including her broken collarbone \u2014 were the result of it pinning her too tightly, which she views as something better safety testing focused on women could improve.",
      "\u201cSeat belts aren\u2019t really built for bodies on females,\u201d Walchesky said. \u201cSome of my injuries, the way the force hit me, they were probably worsened.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group, said in a statement to the AP that the better way to ensure safety \u2014 which it called its top priority \u2014 is through upgrades to the existing Hybrid dummy rather than mandating a new one.",
      "\u201cThis can happen on a faster timeline and lead to quicker safety improvements than requiring NHTSA to adopt unproven crash test dummy technology,\u201d the alliance said.",
      "Humanetics' THOR dummies received high marks in the vehicle safety agency's early tests. Using cadavers from actual crashes to compare the results, NHTSA found they outperformed the existing Hybrid in predicting almost all injuries \u2014 including to the head, neck, shoulders, abdomen and legs.",
      "A separate review by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, was far more critical of the dummy's ability to predict chest injuries in a frontal crash. Despite the vast expansion in the number of sensors, the insurance institute's testing found, the male THOR dummy was less accurate than the current Hybrid dummies, which also had limitations.",
      "\u201cMore isn\u2019t necessarily better,\u201d said Jessica Jermakian, senior vice president for vehicle research at IIHS. \u201cYou also have to be confident that the data is telling you the right things about how a real person would fare in that crash.\"",
      "NHTSA\u2019s budget plan commits to developing the female THOR 5F version with the ultimate goal of incorporating it into the testing. But there could be a long wait considering the THOR's male version adopted by other countries is still awaiting final approval in the U.S.",
      "A 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, which conducts research for Congress, cited numerous \u201cmissed milestones\u201d in NHTSA's development of various crash dummy enhancements \u2014 including in the THOR models.",
      "Kuhn acknowledges being frustrated by the slow process of trying to change the regulations. She says she understands why there's reluctance from auto companies if they fear being forced to make widespread design changes with more consideration for women's safety.",
      "\u201cFortunately, they have very skilled engineers and they\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that takes some explaining, even for New Yorkers who have used it before.",
      "Voters' understanding of how ranked choice works could play a role in which candidate comes out on top in a race that features former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani and several other current and former public officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested last week at an immigration court.",
      "The system is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren't forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote.",
      "Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter's top choice doesn't have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor.",
      "The system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could also take longer to get results.",
      "In New York City's version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on the ballot.",
      "If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters \u2014 more than 50% \u2014 that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election.",
      "If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in.",
      "Vote tabulation is done by computer in rounds. After the first round, the candidate in last place \u2014 the candidate ranked No. 1 by the fewest amount of people \u2014 is eliminated. The computer then looks at the ballots cast by people who ranked that candidate first, to see who they ranked second. Those people's votes are then redistributed to their second choices.",
      "That process then repeats. As more candidates are eliminated, voters' third, fourth and even fifth choices could potentially come into play. Rounds continue until there are only two candidates left. The one with the most votes wins.",
      "Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn't one of them. He's a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.",
      "The computerized process of tabulating votes takes little time, but it doesn't start right away.",
      "Polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday. Within a few hours, preliminary results should give a picture of how the candidates are doing based on voters' first choices.",
      "The ranked choice tabulations, however, won't start until July 1 because the city needs to wait for the arrival of mail-in ballots.",
      "The July 1 tabulation could potentially give a clear picture of who won, but the result won't be official. Further rounds of ranked choice analysis will be done as additional absentee ballots come in until the board certifies the election July 15.",
      "This will be the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary. The first time, in 2021, things went haywire when elections officials neglected to clear test data from the tabulation program. That led to an inaccurate vote tally being reported until officials realized the error.",
      "Officials are hoping things go smoother this time.",
      "One benefit is that nobody \u201cwastes\u201d their vote by picking an unpopular candidate as their first choice.",
      "Voters can rank someone they like No. 1, even if they suspect the candidate doesn't stand a chance. If that person is eliminated, voters still get a say in who wins based on their other rankings.",
      "Another benefit is that it's tough for someone to get elected without broad support. In a traditional election, it's possible for someone with fringe political views to win in a crowded field of candidates, even if they are deeply disliked by a majority of voters.",
      "That's theoretically less likely in a ranked choice system. A candidate could get the largest share of first-choice votes but still lose to someone who is the second or third choice of a large number of people.",
      "The system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do more research. It also makes races less predictable.",
      "Transparency and trust are also potential problems. Ordinarily, candidates, the public and news organizations can see votes coming in, precinct by precinct, and know exactly who is leading and where their support comes from.",
      "Under the ranked choice system, the process of redistributing votes is done by computer. Outside groups will have a harder time evaluating whether the software sorted the ranked votes accurately.",
      "That\u2019s a challenge for news organizations, like The Associated Press, that analyze vote tallies and attempt to report a winner before the count is complete.",
      "There may be instances when candidates who seem to have a comfortable lead in first-place votes on election night lose because relatively few voters rank them as their second or third choice. That could lead to people questioning the results.",

      "Elon Musk has long promised to put a fleet of driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\" on the roads, but fans and shareholders have been kept waiting",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk promised in 2019 that driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\u201d would be on the road \u201cnext year,\u201d but it didn\u2019t happen. A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn\u2019t happen either.",
      "Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, \u201cNext year for sure, we\u2019ll have over a million robotaxis.\u201d",
      "Would you settle for 10 or 12?",
      "Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, starting Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.",
      "The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.",
      "While Musk was making those \u201cnext year\u201d promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.",
      "Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout  when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.",
      "Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he\u2019s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company \u2014 self-driving car promises aside \u2014 and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.",
      "Musk says the Austin test will begin modestly enough, with just 10 or 12 vehicles picking up passengers in a limited area. But then it will quickly ramp up and spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.",
      "Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.",
      "\u201cHow quickly can he expand the fleet?\u201d asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. \u201cWe're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.\"",
      "Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,\" he says. \u201cTesting is going to take a while.\u201d",
      "Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.",
      "In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.",
      "More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.",
      "Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.",
      "Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk \u201cknowingly\u201d made false statements.",
      "Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.",
      "He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.",
      "\u201cInstead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,\u201d Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. \u201cYou will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.\u201d",
      "Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.",
      "\u201cTesla will have, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Musk mused in an conference call with investors, \u201d99% market share or something ridiculous.\u201d Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.",
      "But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.",
      "He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.",
      "\u201cMaybe his timelines aren\u2019t realistic,\" Goldstein says, \u201cbut he can develop futuristic technology products.\u201d",

      "A Connecticut man whose parents were kidnapped after he took part in a $245 million Bitcoin theft has pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges and has agreed to testify against his co-defendants, according to court documents that were unsealed this week.",
      "Veer Chetal, 19, from Danbury, Connecticut, was one of three men charged with stealing 4,100 Bitcoins from a victim in Washington, D.C., in an elaborate online scam last August. The trio lived large after the heist, spending millions of dollars on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties, prosecutors say.",
      "A week after the theft, Chetal's parents were assaulted and kidnapped briefly in Danbury in a failed ransom plot aimed at Chetal, who the attackers believed had a large amount of cryptocurrency, authorities said.",
      "Chetal's criminal case was unsealed on Monday in federal court in Washington, revealing his guilty pleas in November and his agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed new allegations that he was involved in about 50 similar thefts that raked in another $3 million between November 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Another man charged in the Bitcoin theft, Malone Lam, was also among 13 people indicted by a federal grand jury in May in an alleged online racketeering conspiracy involving cryptocurrency thefts across the U.S. and overseas that netted more than $260 million, including the $245 million Bitcoin theft.",
      "Chetal is facing 19 to 24 years in prison, a fine between $50,000 and $500,000 and restitution to the victim that has yet to be determined, according federal sentencing guidelines and his plea agreement.",
      "His lawyer, David Weinstein, declined to comment, saying Chetal's case is still pending.",
      "In September, federal agents with a search warrant raided Chetal's apartment in Brunswick, New Jersey, and his parents' home in Danbury in connection with the $245 million Bitcoin heist. Authorities said they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches and high-end clothing. Federal agents also said Chetal had $39 million worth of cryptocurrency that he turned over to investigators.",
      "Authorities alleged Chetal, Lam and Jeandiel Serrano were involved in online \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks against cryptocurrency holders. Lam would send victims alerts about unauthorized attempts to access their crypto accounts, while the others would call the victims posing as representatives from well-known companies like Google and Yahoo and gain access to their accounts, authorities said.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with lawyers for Lam and Serrano on Friday.",
      "A week after the theft, six Florida men were accused of kidnapping Chetal's parents in broad daylight in Danbury. One of them crashed a car into the parents' Lamborghini, while others pulled up in a van, police said. The attackers forced the couple out of their vehicle, beat them, put them in the van and tied them up, police said.",
      "The plot was foiled, and the attackers were arrested quickly because there were eyewitnesses who immediately called police, and an off-duty FBI agent happened to be driving by at the time of the kidnapping, authorities said. Federal agents said a seventh man who was later arrested in connection with the kidnapping had previously gotten into a dispute with Chetal that turned physical at a Miami nightclub.",
      "The attack on the couple is part of an increasing trend worldwide in robbers using violence to steal cryptocurrency.",
      "Chetal, who was attending Rutgers University in New Jersey at the time of the $245 million theft and later withdrew, was born in India and came to the U.S. with his family when he was 4 years old in 2010, according to court documents. His father was granted a foreign worker's visa, and his wife and children obtained related dependent visas.",
      "Federal authorities said Chetal could face deportation as a result of the criminal case.",
      "Authorities say Chetal's father lost his job at Morgan Stanley because of the kidnapping and his son's connection to it.",
      "Chetal was initially released from federal custody on his own recognizance. But a judge ordered him detained until trial earlier this year after federal prosecutors said they discovered Chetal was involved in another crypto theft worth $2 million in October that he didn't tell them about, after he had begun cooperating with federal authorities.",

      "Researchers at cybersecurity outlet Cybernews say that billions of login credentials have been leaked and compiled into datasets online, giving cybercriminals \u201cunprecedented access\u201d to accounts consumers use each day",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers at cybersecurity outlet Cybernews say that billions of login credentials have been leaked and compiled into datasets online, giving criminals \u201cunprecedented access\u201d to accounts consumers use each day.",
      "According to a report published this week, Cybernews researchers have recently discovered 30 exposed datasets that each contain a vast amount of login information \u2014 amounting to a total of 16 billion compromised credentials. That includes user passwords for a range of popular platforms including Google, Facebook and Apple.",
      "Sixteen billion is roughly double the amount of people on Earth today, signaling that impacted consumers may have had credentials for more than one account leaked. Cybernews notes that there are most certainly duplicates in the data and so \u201cit's impossible to tell how many people or accounts were actually exposed.\u201d",
      "It's also important to note that the leaked login information doesn't span from a single source, such as one breach targeting a company. Instead, it appears that the data was stolen through multiple events over time, and then compiled and briefly exposed publicly, which is when Cybernews reports that its researchers discovered it.",
      "Various infostealers are most likely the culprit, Cybernews noted. Infostealers are a form of malicious software that breaches a victim's device or systems to take sensitive information.",
      "Many questions remain about these leaked credentials, including whose hands the login credentials are in now. But, as data breaches become more and more common in today's world, experts continue to stress the importance of maintaining key \u201ccyber hygiene.\u201d",
      "If you're worried about your account data potentially being exposed in a recent breach, the first thing you can do is change your password \u2014 and avoid using the same or similar login credentials on multiple sites. If you find it too hard to memorize all your different passwords, consider a password manager or passkey. And also add multifactor authentication, which can serve as a second layer of verification through your phone, email or USB authenticator key.",

      "As the war between Israel and Iran hits the one-week mark, Iranians have spent nearly half of the conflict in a near-communication blackout, unable to connect not only with the outside world but also with their neighbors and loved ones across the country",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- As the war between Israel and Iran hits the one-week mark, Iranians have spent nearly half of the conflict in a near-communication blackout, unable to connect not only with the outside world but also with their neighbors and loved ones across the country.",
      "Civilians are left unaware of when and where Israel will strike next, despite Israeli forces issuing warnings through their Persian-language online channels. When the missiles land, disconnected phone and web services mean not knowing for hours or days if their family or friends are among the victims. That\u2019s left many scrambling on various social media apps to see what\u2019s happening \u2014 again, only a glimpse of life able to reach the internet in a nation of over 80 million people.",
      "Activists see it as a form of psychological warfare for a nation all-too familiar with state information controls and targeted internet shutdowns during protests and unrest.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian regime controls the information sphere really, really tightly,\u201d Marwa Fatafta, the Berlin-based policy and advocacy director for digital rights group Access Now, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe know why the Iranian regime shuts down. It wants to control information. So their goal is quite clear.\u201d",
      "But this time, it\u2019s happening during a deadly conflict that erupted on June 13 with Israeli airstrikes targeting nuclear and military sites, top generals and nuclear scientists. At least 657 people, including 263 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 2,000 wounded, according to a Washington-based group called Human Rights Activists.",
      "Iran has retaliated by firing 450 missiles and 1,000 drones at Israel, according to Israeli military estimates. Most have been shot down by Israel\u2019s multitiered air defenses, but at least 24 people in Israel have been killed and hundreds others wounded. Guidance from Israeli authorities, as well as round-the-clock news broadcasts, flows freely and consistently to Israeli citizens, creating in the last seven days an uneven picture of the death and destruction brought by the war.",
      "The Iranian government contended Friday that it was Israel who was \u201cwaging a war on truth and human conscience.\" In a post on X, a social media platform blocked for many of its citizens, Iran's Foreign Ministry asserted Israel banned foreign media from covering missile strikes.",
      "The statement added that Iran would organize \u201cglobal press tours to expose Israel's war crimes\u201d in the country. Iran is one of the world\u2019s top jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and in the best of times, reporters face strict restrictions.",
      "Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org reported on Friday that Iran had been disconnected from the global internet for 36 hours, with its live metrics showing that national connectivity remained at only a few percentage points of normal levels. The group said a handful of users have been able to maintain connectivity through virtual private networks.",
      "Those lucky few have become lifelines for Iranians left in the dark. In recent days, those who have gained access to mobile internet for a limited time describe using that fleeting opportunity to make calls on behalf of others, checking in on elderly parents and grandparents, and locating those who have fled Tehran.",
      "The only access to information Iranians do have is limited to websites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s state-run television and radio stations offer irregular updates on what\u2019s happening inside the country, instead focusing their time on the damage wrought by their strikes on Israel.",
      "The lack of information going in or out of Iran is stunning, considering that the advancement of technology in recent decades has only brought far-flung conflicts in Ukraine, the Gaza Strip and elsewhere directly to a person's phone anywhere in the world.",
      "That direct line has been seen by experts as a powerful tool to shift public opinion about any ongoing conflict and potentially force the international community to take a side. It has also turned into real action from world leaders under public and online pressure to act or use their power to bring an end to the fighting.",
      "But Mehdi Yahyanejad, a key figure in promoting internet freedom in Iran, said that the Islamic Republic is seeking to \u201cpurport an image\u201d of strength, one that depicts only the narrative that Israel is being destroyed by sophisticated Iranian weapons that include ballistic missiles with multiple warheads.",
      "\u201cI think most likely they\u2019re just afraid of the internet getting used to cause mass unrest in the next phase of whatever is happening,\u201d Yahayanejad said. \u201cI mean, some of it could be, of course, planned by the Israelis through their agents on the ground, and some of this could be just a spontaneous unrest by the population once they figure out that the Iranian government is badly weakened.",

      "U.K. lawmakers have backed a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law",
      "LONDON -- U.K. lawmakers on Friday approved a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law.",
      "Members of Parliament voted 314-291 to back the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill following an impassioned and respectful debate. The majority of 23 was less than the 55 when they last voted on the issue in November, meaning that some lawmakers changed their minds in the intervening months.",
      "Since November, the bill has been scrutinized, leading to some changes in the proposed legislation, which has been shepherded through Parliament by Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater rather than the government.",
      "\u201cI appreciate it's a huge moment for the country.\u201d she told Sky News after the vote. \u201cIt was a huge sense of relief because this is the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "It's not quite law yet as the bill now goes to the unelected House of Lords, which can amend or delay policy, though it can\u2019t overrule the lower chamber.",
      "The vote is potentially the biggest change to social policy since abortion was partially legalized in 1967.",
      "The bill would allow terminally ill adults over age 18 in England and Wales, who are deemed to have less than six months to live, to apply for an assisted death. This particular bill doesn\u2019t apply to Northern Ireland and Scotland, the latter of which is holding its own vote on the issue.",
      "Perhaps the most important change to the bill from last November was the dropping of the requirement that a judge sign off on any decision. Many in the legal profession had objected.",
      "Now any request would be subject to approval by two doctors and a panel featuring a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.",
      "Changes were also made to ensure the establishment of independent advocates to support people with learning disabilities, autism or mental health conditions and the creation of a disability advisory board.",
      "Having received the go-ahead from doctors and the panel, the terminally ill person would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves.",
      "Another big change made was that \u201cno person,\u201d including doctors, social care workers and pharmacists, will be obliged to take part.",
      "For months, the bill has divided lawmakers, political parties, as well as the country.",
      "Proponents of the bill argued that those with a terminal diagnosis must be given a choice at the end of their lives to relieve their suffering. They also said that the current situation discriminates against the poor as wealthy individuals can already travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones die.",
      "However, opponents warned that the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled and older people, could be at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, into ending their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members.",
      "Supporters of both sides all agreed of the need to make improvements in palliative care and greater investments in hospices to ease suffering.",
      "Passions were running high outside of Parliament where hundreds of people gathered to make their voices heard.",
      "Supporters were dressed in clothing emblazoned with the phrase \u201cCampaign for Dignity in Dying,\u201d while opponents held up banners urging lawmakers not to make the state-run National Health Service the \u201cNational Suicide Service.\u201d",
      "The legislation now goes to the unelected House of Lords, Any amendments would then go back to the House of Commons.",
      "Backers of the bill say implementation will take four years, rather than the initially suggested two. That means it could become law in 2029, around the time that the next general election must be held.",
      "There is clearly no consensus in the Cabinet about the measure.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer backed the bill on Friday, while his health secretary, Wes Streeting, voted against.",
      "The government has said it will respect the outcome.",
      "However, it's not clear what the cost implications are, or how it would impact the NHS, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.",

      "Summer gets its official start in the Northern Hemisphere with the arrival of the summer solstice",
      "Peak sunshine has arrived in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 the summer solstice.",
      "Friday is the longest day of the year north of the equator, where the solstice marks the start of astronomical summer. It's the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the shortest day of the year and winter will start.",
      "The word \u201csolstice\u201d comes from the Latin words \u201csol\u201d for sun and \u201cstitium\u201d which can mean \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cstop.\u201d The solstice is the end of the sun's annual march higher in the sky, when it makes its longest, highest arc. The bad news for sun lovers: It then starts retreating and days will get a little shorter every day until late December.",
      "People have marked solstices for eons with celebrations and monuments, including Stonehenge, which was designed to align with the sun's paths at the solstices. But what is happening in the heavens? Here\u2019s what to know about the Earth\u2019s orbit.",
      "As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle relative to the sun. For most of the year, the Earth\u2019s axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the sun\u2019s warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet.",
      "The solstices mark the times during the year when this tilt is at its most extreme, and days and nights are at their most unequal.",
      "During the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer solstice, the upper half of the earth is tilted toward the sun, creating the longest day and shortest night of the year. This solstice falls between June 20 and 22.",
      "Meanwhile, at the winter solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is leaning away from the sun \u2014 leading to the shortest day and longest night of the year. The winter solstice falls between December 20 and 23.",
      "During the equinox, the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit line up so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.",
      "The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night. That\u2019s because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time \u2014 though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet.",
      "The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s spring \u2014 or vernal \u2014 equinox can land between March 19 and 21, depending on the year. Its fall \u2013 or autumnal \u2014 equinox can land between Sept. 21 and 24.",
      "On the equator, the sun will be directly overhead at noon. Equinoxes are the only time when both the north and south poles are lit by sunshine at the same time.",
      "These are just two different ways to carve up the year.",
      "While astronomical seasons depend on how the Earth moves around the sun, meteorological seasons are defined by the weather. They break down the year into three-month seasons based on annual temperature cycles. By that calendar, spring starts on March 1, summer on June 1, fall on Sept. 1 and winter on Dec. 1.",

      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don\u2019t return as expected",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cHave you seen the cats?\u201d",
      "That's a common refrain in my household because our two felines, Maple and Juniper, can venture outside through a flap in the backdoor. Like many other London house cats, they're free to come and go, roaming the surrounding backyards and beyond, equipped with microchips to identify them if they get lost.",
      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don't return as expected.",
      "If you're worried about your furry friend's whereabouts, technology can help you keep tabs on them.",
      "Dedicated pet trackers are collar-worn devices that typically use GPS signals to pinpoint the location of the animal wearing them. They use a 4G cellphone signal or your home Wi-Fi connection to relay the position to a smartphone app.",
      "There are many products on the market. Tractive, Jiobit and Pawfit are among brands that offer trackers for both dogs and cats. Devices for the latter are generally smaller and lighter.",
      "Dog trackers with integrated collars are available from Fi and Whistle. PetTracer is a cat collar that uses both GPS and radio signals from a home base station. FitBark, also for dogs, has an Apple Watch app to monitor location and other activity.",
      "Garmin has a range of GPS dog collars that work with handheld devices resembling walkie-talkies, but they're pricey and aimed at outdoors enthusiasts like hunters.",
      "Most trackers let you designate a safe zone on a map, usually your house and surrounding area, and alert you if your pet has left it.",
      "They usually operate on the 4G LTE spectrum commonly used by wireless carriers. It typically has the longest range of any cellular signal, said Andrew Bleiman, Tractive's executive vice president for North America.",
      "That means strong connectivity in most of Europe and North America \u201cunless you\u2019re in a really far flung place like the middle of a national park,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "Exact price depends on brand and model. Most devices sell for less than $100. However, keep in mind you'll also have to pay a subscription fee for the cell service to function.",
      "While that could cost $100 or more a year, for some pet owners it's worth the \u201cpeace of mind,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "The collars usually have a built-in rechargeable battery but battery life varies. Most will be last at least two to three days before they need charging, and a lot longer in ideal conditions.",
      "One big factor is signal strength. The battery will drain faster if the device has to work harder to pick up the GPS or connect to Wi-Fi. Some save power by not sending coordinates in the safe zone.",
      "Like fitness watches for humans, pet tracking apps offer health and activity monitoring features. You can see how long your cat or dog has spent resting or exercising on a daily or hourly basis.",
      "But be aware, a tracker is \u201cnot going to keep your pet in the backyard,\" Bleiman said. It will only \"alert you when they leave the virtual fence area that you set up.\u201d",
      "This One TechTip was inspired by Maple, who once went AWOL for days. It turned out he was hanging out in a backyard 10 doors down the street. We only found out after the residents got hold of a pet microchip scanner to look up our contact details to let us know so we could retrieve him.",
      "Tractive provided a loaner device to try. Using the included breakaway collar, we put it on Maple, who clearly didn\u2019t like it at first. He dashed out the back door and jumped through a hole in the fence.",
      "Over the next day, I used the Tractive app to monitor his movements. It showed his travels back and forth onto various neighboring properties. He came back to rest for a few hours around midnight, went out to prowl again around 3 a.m, then came back after an hour to nap some more.",
      "It was fascinating to see where he was spending his time. According to the app's \u201cheatmap,\" one of Maple's favorite spots was the same backyard where we had to retrieve him previously.",
      "About 24 hours after I attached the Tractive collar on Maple, I noticed he was no longer wearing it. It had somehow come off.",
      "If you can't find your pet's exact location, or the device gets lost, Tractive has a \u201cradar\u201d feature to pinpoint it with your phone's Bluetooth. Other brands have similar features.",
      "On the app's map, I could see it was in a nearby backyard and that I was getting closer because the circle was getting bigger. But I couldn\u2019t figure out where it was and, not wanting to disturb the neighbors, I gave up.",
      "Bleiman recommends using a harness for cats that don't like collars, but I'm not convinced.",
      "It's common for cats and dogs to be implanted with microchips, with the details added to a database. That makes it much easier to reunite owners with lost dogs and cats, even if they've strayed hundreds of miles away or gone missing for years.",
      "Pet microchips, about the size of a grain of rice implanted just below the skin, are legally required in some European countries. There's no federal law in the U.S., though some places like Hawaii now require them, so check with state or local authorities.",
      "But there's some confusion about what microchips can do. Because they don't have a power supply, they can't be tracked in real time. Whoever finds your pet would need to take it to a vet or a shelter to can scan the device for contact details.",
      "Many pet owners use Bluetooth trackers like Apple's Air Tags, Samsung's SmartTags or similar devices from Tile, Cube and Chipolo, which rely on low-power signals relayed by passing smartphones.",
      "Bluetooth trackers have a range of 100 to 500 feet (30 to 150 meters), depending on the model. The batteries last for months if not longer, and there's no need to pay for a subscription.",
      "However, they're not specifically marketed for pets. That hasn't stopped pet owners, judging from many recommendations they've posted in online forums.",
      "Chipolo advises that its round plastic trackers are only for \u201cin-house pets like house-trained cats and smaller dogs\u201d and warns against using them on \"larger dog breeds and outdoor cats.\"",
      "Still, they can be a solution for some pet owners.",
      "\u201cBluetooth is a totally reasonable solution if you\u2019re in a downtown urban core,\u201d Bleiman said. \u201cBut pets move fast. And if you\u2019re in a wooded park, or you\u2019re in a suburban area \u2014 let alone a more rural or wilderness area \u2014 it\u2019s pretty unlikely your pet is going to be close to a Bluetooth device.\"",

    "story": [
      "For European drone manufacturers, being able to say that their equipment has been tried in war by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch",
      "LE BOURGET, France -- About once a month, French drone manufacturer Henri Seydoux makes what has become a necessary pilgrimage for many in his business \u2014 he goes to Ukraine.",
      "Because for drone technology, there is no harder place to survive than the frontlines of the war against Russia\u2019s invasion, where both sides are using unmanned aerial machines of all shapes and sizes to kill and to observe, reshaping modern warfare.",
      "And because the battlefields also bristle with electronic countermeasures and weapons to confuse, jam and shoot down drones, Ukraine has also become an extreme real-life proving ground for advances in drone technology, some of which has started to spill over into non-military sectors.",
      "For manufacturers, being able to say that their drones and related equipment have been battle-tried and tested by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch as they market their wares not just to national defense departments, but also to police forces, border authorities, rescue services and civilian users.",
      "\u201cWhen we say, \u2018This is a good machine, it works,\u2019 people can believe us or not. But when it\u2019s guys in Ukraine and others saying they\u2019re happy, it has greater value,\" says Bastien Mancini, president and co-founder of French drone manufacturer Delair, which has teamed up with European defense contractor KNDS to supply Ukrainian forces with 100 exploding drones. KNDS' sales literature notes that they are \u201ccombat-proven.\"",
      "Mancini says civilian users of Delair's other non-military drones \u201csee things that work in Ukraine and say to themselves, \u2018It resists jamming, it resists the loss of a radio connection and whatnot and so it\u2019s going to be fine for civilian use, like inspecting electric cables or whatever.\"",
      "\u201cIt really has helped us win markets. It gives people confidence,\" he told The Associated Press at the Paris Air Show, a major shop-window for the aviation and defense industries.",
      "Henri Seydoux, the founder and head of French drone maker Parrot, says Ukraine is \u201cfascinating\u201d from a drone-technology perspective because \u201cit changes so quickly, there are new ideas non-stop.\u201d He's been making regular trips since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 to meet Ukrainian drone manufacturers, drone software developers and the military authorities.",
      "\u201cEvery quarter, the situation changes completely,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cEvery company, let\u2019s say, that makes military equipment or every army is very interested by drones. But the ones that really use them and understand how to use them is the Ukrainians.\"",
      "For Ukraine, trying to defend against swarms of Russian drones that target cities and waves of drone-supported Russian troops is a matter of survival. So, too, is finding workarounds to counter electronic warfare systems that Russia deploys to jam and disable Ukrainian drones, igniting what has become a drone-technology arms race between the two sides and for manufacturers outside of Ukraine, too.",
      "Small drones that drop bombs and explode against targets \u2014 mass-produced at a fraction of the cost of other more complex weapons systems that its allies have supplied \u2014 have become increasingly vital for Ukraine's resistance. Its Defense Ministry has said that it plans to buy 4.5 million drones this year, all Ukrainian-made, that allow their operators to see what the machines see, so they can guide the flights in real time \u2014 exploding in a Russian trench, for example, or even against a single enemy soldier. That's three times more drones than the ministry bought last year, it says.",
      "\u201cDrones saved Ukraine,\u201d said Alex Vorobei, the Ukrainian sales representative for Ailand Systems, a Ukrainian start-up developing a drone that detects land mines.",
      "Vorobei and others in the drone business say that manufacturers not involved in Ukraine risk being left behind.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the defense field and still not in Ukraine, it means you are nowhere,\" Vorobei said at the Paris show.",
      "A micro surveillance drone unveiled by Parrot at the Paris show has a nod to Ukraine in its name \u2014 the Anafi UKR \u2014 and also has been field-tested in what Seydoux describes as the \u201cvery harsh environment\u201d on the frontline. It\u2019s equipped with artificial intelligence technology to enable it to find its way when radio and navigational signals are jammed.",
      "Parrot says the drone\u2019s ready-for-war resilience and features also make it a good fit for law enforcement operations, such as monitoring crowds, tracking suspects or keeping watch over borders, and for rescue services in remote areas or during fires and accidents when navigational signals might go down.",
      "Ukraine has been \u201ca real laboratory or test for us, to see if our products worked,\u201d said Delair's Mancini. Its Oskar exploding drone, which has polystyrene wings, carries a half-kilogram (one pound) warhead to detonate against troops and lightly armored vehicles.",
      "Delair developed it in under a year, repurposing one of its civilian drones that was already used in France for mapping and inspecting power cables, and hardening it for Ukraine with technology to resist Russian jamming.",
      "\"Five or 10 years ago, lots of people were asking themselves, \u2019Are drones really useful for something?' No one is asking that question today,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Facing the possibility of life in prison if convicted on all counts, Combs has remained largely silent since the trial began last month.",
    "story": [
      "Deliberations in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' trial could start as early as Friday.",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs may have made his fortune with lyrics, but told a judge Tuesday that he is reserving the right not to share his words by not taking the stand in his sex-trafficking trial, which is expected to conclude this week.",
      "Combs' decision came about an hour after prosecutors rested their lengthy case against Combs, after calling 34 witnesses over 28 days. They spent seven weeks trying to convince a federal jury that the rap mogul used his business empire to coerce women into sex.",
      "Facing the possibility of life in prison if convicted on all counts, Combs has remained largely silent since the trial began last month but confidently told the judge overseeing the case that he will not be testifying.",
      "\"That is my decision with my lawyers,\" said Combs, as his voice boomed through the hushed courtroom.",
      "\"How are you feeling today?\" U.S. District Judge Arun Subramian asked Combs, standing to reply.",
      "\"I'm doing great, how are you, your honor? I want to tell you thank you. You're doing an excellent job,\" Combs said.",
      "The moment marked a rare departure from the formality of the trial and the testimony, which has been marked by deeply emotional and at times disturbing testimony.",
      "Following Combs' announcement, his lawyers presented a brief case, only showing the jury evidence that, they say, casts doubt on the testimony of some witnesses. Combs' attorneys said the evidence suggests the alleged victims in the case actually consented to the sometimes days-long sex parties known as \"freak offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Those orgies are at the core of the case against Combs, as prosecutors have alleged the rapper used his employees, wealth and influence to pressure women to participate and then blackmailed or threatened them into silence. According to the testimony, Combs would choreograph the episodes and then watch and masturbate while his girlfriends would have sex with male prostitutes.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "The defense rested its case on Tuesday after asking the judge to issue an immediate acquittal. Subramian did not rule on that motion, which is standard in criminal cases.",
      "Lawyers for both sides are set to return to court Wednesday to work with the judge on the specific instructions that will be issued to the jury before deliberations begin.",
      "The jury is scheduled to return to court on Thursday to hear closing statements. Deliberations could start as early as Friday.",
      "Judge reserves decision on Combs' request to toss case",
      "As soon as prosecutors rested their case against Combs, defense lawyers asked the judge to find Combs not guilty of all charges.",
      "The move \u2013 known as a motion for a \"directed verdict\" \u2013 is an argument that prosecutors did not present a case that proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Defense attorneys routinely make the motion after the government rests, and judges rarely grant the request.",
      "\"The evidence does not establish that Mr. Combs conspired with any other person to violate the (racketeering) statute,\" defense attorney Alexandra Shapiro said. \"They failed to show that any other individual actually conspired with him to conduct the affairs of this 20-year purported criminal enterprise.\"",
      "Shapiro argued that any employees who might have helped Combs set up hotel rooms for \"freak offs\" did the tasks as \"personal errands\" for Combs and did not know about the sexual activity that took place in the rooms.",
      "Shapiro also took aim at allegations made by federal prosecutors, who have argued Combs firebombed the Porsche owned by rapper Kid Cudi or committed bribery to silence a security guard who witnessed the aftermath of a 2016 assault.",
      "Defense lawyers also went back to one of their key themes from throughout the trial \u2014while Combs may have engaged in domestic violence and led an unconventional sex life, he didn't commit a crime, and that prosecutors failed to prove he engaged in sex trafficking.",
      "\"Domestic violence is not sex trafficking,\" Shapiro said.",
      "Combs' lawyers decline to call any witnesses during brief defense case",
      "Combs' defense lawyers rested their case without calling any witnesses, instead only reading some items into the record.",
      "Defense attorney Anna Estevao read exchanges of text messages from the singer Cassie Ventura, who expressed her love for Combs even after years of what federal prosecutors argued was coerced sex with male escorts. Ventura and Combs were longtime romantic partners.",
      "\"Bottom line, I love you. You are important to me, and I know I will never have a love like this in this lifetime,\" Ventura wrote in a 2012 message. \"Besides making love, talking to you is my favorite thing.\"",
      "In another message, Ventura told Combs, \"I miss you.\"",
      "Combs responded, \"So what you going to do.\" Ventura replied, \"Be your lil freak.\"",
      "Defense attorney Teny Geragos also read notes from law enforcement sessions with witnesses, suggesting some of the testimony differed from original statements.",
      "Daniel Phillip, the second witness to testify during the trial, originally told jurors that he saw Combs throw a bottle toward Ventura and \"grabbed her by her hair and dragged her by her hair into the bedroom. Phillip testified Combs emerged from the bedroom a while later to ask Phillip \"are you guys ready to continue?\"",
      "Geragos read law enforcement notes from a meeting with Phillip that seemed to indicate Combs said something else: \"In approximately 2013, Phillip saw Ventura get physically assaulted. Combs eventually came back out and said 'Yo man I'm going to have to deal with this. You need to get the f\u2014- out,'\" Geragos read.",
      "While Combs' attorneys presented a defense case without any witnesses, they spent days thoroughly questioning the prosecution's witnesses and using cross-examination to present the bulk of their arguments to the jury. They tried to cast doubt on the testimony of the alleged victims, highlighting positive and loving messages exchanged with Combs, and arguing the interactions suggest the women were willing participants in the orgies.",

    "story": [
      "Bove has been nominated by President Trump to fill a U.S. appeals court vacancy.",
      "A top Justice Department official nominated by President Donald Trump to fill a federal appeals court vacancy allegedly suggested the Trump administration should defy judicial orders that sought to restrict their aggressive efforts to deport undocumented immigrants earlier this year, according to a whistleblower complaint from a fired DOJ career official.",
      "The 27-page complaint, provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Justice Department's top watchdog and obtained by ABC News, alleges that Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove and other top DOJ officials strategized how they could mislead courts regarding the administration's immigration enforcement efforts and potentially ignore judges' rulings outright.",
      "The allegations from Erez Reuveni -- who was fired from the department in April after he appeared in federal court in Maryland and admitted to a judge that the government had mistakenly deported accused MS-13 member Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador -- were delivered to the Senate on the eve of a confirmation hearing for Bove to serve on the powerful 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "\"Mr. Reuveni's disclosures detail violations of law, rules or regulations, and the abuse of authority by DOJ and White House personnel, as well as the creation of substantial and specific health and safety threats to noncitizens,\" Reuveni's attorneys said in the letter.",
      "\"These high-level governmental personnel knowingly and willfully defied court orders, directed their subordinate attorneys to make misrepresentations to courts, and engaged in a scheme to withhold relevant information from the court to advance the Administration's priority of deporting noncitizens,\" the letter said.",
      "Reuveni's whistleblower complaint details several internal meetings where he alleges Bove and other officials debated over how they could evade legal scrutiny in implementing President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th century wartime authority used to remove noncitizens with little-to-no due process. At a meeting on March 14, the complaint alleges that Bove said the department should consider saying \"f--- you\" to the courts and \"ignore any such court order.\"",
      "\"Mr. Reuveni was stunned by Bove's statement because, to Mr. Reuveni's knowledge, no one in DOJ leadership -- in any Administration -- had ever suggested the Department of Justice could blatantly ignore court orders,\" the letter says, repeating the expletive. \"Mr. Reuveni was in disbelief, because, on the contrary, the Department of Justice consistently advises its clients of their obligation to follow court orders, not to ignore them.\"",
      "In a statement to The New York Times responding to the letter -- which was first reported by the paper -- Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche described Reuveni as a \"disgruntled former employee\" and said that his accusations about Bove and other DOJ leadership \"are utterly false.\"",
      "\"I was at the meeting described in the [New York Times] article and at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed,\" Blanche said.",
      "The allegations by Reuveni fall at the center of an effort by D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg to potentially hold top administration officials in contempt for violating a March 15 order to turn a plane of undocumented immigrants deported under the Alien Enemies Act around before it arrived in El Salvador. That inquiry was put on a temporary hold by an appeals court panel in the D.C. Circuit in April.",
      "Bove, according to Reuveni's account, made clear to officials the day before Boasberg's order that the planes carrying the deported individuals \"needed to take off no matter what,\" and that is when he made the comment about potentially defying court orders.",
      "Officials in the room \"looked stunned\" following Bove's alleged remarks, and those in the room left the meeting still \"understanding that DOJ would tell DHS to follow all court orders,\" according to Reuveni.",
      "In Reuveni's telling, the meeting was just one in a series of instances that demonstrated efforts by White House and DOJ leadership to defy court orders \"through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation.\"",
      "\"Discouraging clients from engaging in illegal conduct is an important part of the role of a lawyer,\" the letter states. \"Mr. Reuveni tried to do so and was thwarted, threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged for both doing his job and telling the truth to the court.\"",
      "Senate Democrats are expected to highlight Reuveni's account at Bove's judicial confirmation hearing Wednesday to bolster their claims that Bove, who previously served as President Trump's personal defense attorney, has abused his position at DOJ to advance Trump's political agenda.",
      "\"These serious allegations, from a career Justice Department lawyer who defended the first Trump Administration's immigration policies, not only speak to Mr. Bove's failure to fulfill his ethical obligations as a lawyer, but demonstrate that his activities are part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his allies to undermine the Justice Department's commitment to the rule of law,\" Senate Judiciary ranking member Dick Durbin said in a statement reacting to Reuveni's letter.",
      "\"And I implore my Senate Republican colleagues: do not turn a blind eye to the dire consequences of confirming Mr. Bove to a lifetime position as a circuit court judge,\" Durbin said.",

      "Congressional Democrats are angry after briefings on the Hill were canceled.",
      "Some senators on Tuesday night viewed the initial classified assessment by U.S. Central Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency on the U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, multiple aides confirmed.",
      "Members of Senate leadership and the Senate Intelligence Committee viewed the document in a classified setting, the aides said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, viewed the document, as did Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., who is a member of the committee.",
      "Senators did not give details about what they saw in the classified document.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he had \"seen some stuff\" when asked about the assessment but did not specify what he had seen.",
      "Warner declined to comment to CNN Tuesday night what was detailed in the preliminary report.",
      "\"But I've got a lot of questions for the administration,\" Warner said. \"I can tell you there was plenty of debate in the open domain about whether bunker-buster bombs alone could take out Iran's facilities. We also have got questions about where all of Iran's enriched uranium is located at this point and if it's not taken out, what next? Are troops still in harm's way?\"",
      "Warner was asked if he believed the briefing might have been postponed due to the preliminary assessment, but he said he did not know.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, a frustrated Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the Trump administration's postponement of Tuesday's scheduled classified briefing on the Iran-Israel conflict \"outrageous,\" \"evasive\" and \"derelict\" -- and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the postponement of the House's briefing \"a slap in the face to the Congress of the United States.\"",
      "\"There is a legal obligation for the administration to inform Congress of what is happening. What are they afraid of? Why won't they engage Congress in the critical details, the result of the recent strike, the scope and trajectory of the conflict, the administration's long-term strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, the potential risks facing American citizens and our service members who we all have an obligation to protect?\" Schumer said while addressing reporters Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Schumer said senators deserve transparency.",
      "\"This last-minute postponement of our briefing is outrageous, it's evasive, it's derelict. They are bobbing and weaving and ducking. Senators deserve full transparency,\" he said.",
      "The Senate's classified briefing, which was set to include briefers from the Department of State as well as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dan Caine, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, had been postponed to later in the week to allow for other briefers to join.",
      "Schumer suggested, and a GOP leadership aide confirmed, that those other briefers who are expected to join the rescheduled meeting on Thursday are Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who are currently at the NATO conference. It's unclear whether the original slate of briefers will still attend Thursday's briefing.",
      "\"I was given no explanation for this delay,\" Schumer told reporters. \"They said 'well Hegseth and Rubio will be here Thursday.' We are happy to hear them on Thursday in addition to this briefing, which we think will be far more valuable than hearing from Hegseth and Rubio, who are secretaries and top people and are very good at political talking points. We need facts; we need real information.\"",
      "Schumer said if Rubio and Hegseth wish to address members he's happy to hear from them. But he also wants to hear from the original slate of briefers.",
      "\"If they want to come up on Thursday in addition -- not in replacement of this hearing -- that is OK,\" Schumer said. \"But the obstruction of this administration on a crucial issue like this where American lives and particularly the lives of American service members are at stake, is their obligation and it undermines the very principles of accountability and oversight that safeguard our democracy.\"",
      "The delay came as an early intelligence assessment showed the attack did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program and likely set it back only by months, according to two people familiar with the assessment.",
      "While the White House is disputing the assessment, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said that it\u2019s further justification for a congressional briefing.",
      "\u201cIt's one of the reasons why we need both a Gang of Eight briefing immediately and a classified briefing for all members of the House of Representatives,\u201d Jeffries said.",
      "Asked on CNN if he believed the briefing might have been postponed because of the preliminary assessment, Warner said he did not know.",
      "Schumer said he has still not received a more formal briefing from the administration since he received a brief call informing him of Saturday night's strike just before it occurred. That call, he said, lacked any specific details.",
      "'Slap in the face'",
      "The House's classified briefing set for Tuesday afternoon was postponed as well, which prompted a legislative tantrum on the floor Tuesday afternoon, with lawmakers demanding an explanation.",
      "Democratic Rep. Yvette Clarke, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, attempted four times to seek an explanation from the chair as part of a \"parliamentary inquiry.\"",
      "Clarke's inquisition was dismissed repeatedly by the presiding chair, Republican Rep. Scott DesJarlais, who informed Clarke that she had not properly stated a parliamentary inquiry.",
      "After some back and forth, Clarke then informed DesJarlais that without an explanation for the postponed briefing, she'd offer a motion to adjourn. That forced the lawmakers to return to the chamber for an unexpected vote to defeat the Democratic motion.",

      "Massie considers pulling War Powers Resolution",
      "When the meetings occur, it's expected that lawmakers, especially Democrats, will be looking for answers and evidence at the briefings from the administration -- specifically why Trump said there was an imminent threat and carried out U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites over the weekend.",
      "Their meetings come after several lawmakers on Capitol Hill argued the military action was unconstitutional. There are several bipartisan resolutions that could receive a vote in coming days that may put some lawmakers in uncomfortable positions as they consider whether Trump ignored the role of Congress in striking Tehran.",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna introduced a War Powers Resolution last week to rebuke the president's decision to launch strikes. As Massie continued to rail against Trump and his role in the conflict, the president lashed out at the Kentucky Republican, saying he was \"not MAGA\" and threatened to campaign for Massie's Republican primary opponent in the next election.",
      "Massie has now softened his approach, telling reporters at the Capitol on Monday that he's now considering pulling the bipartisan War Powers Resolution.",
      "\"If the ceasefire holds, and we're not engaged in hostilities, then it's a moot point. I wouldn't need to bring it to the floor,\" Massie said.",
      "Massie also added that he is open to patching things up with the president: \"I'd like a ceasefire between me and President Trump. If I can get the same deal, after his bunker busters he dropped on me.\"",
      "Trump on Monday announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, after more than a week of fighting following Israel's strikes -- and subsequent U.S. attacks -- on Iran's nuclear program. Hours after the ceasefire took effect, Israel said Iran violated it -- which Iran denies.",
      "Trump expressed anger at both Israel and Iran, accusing both of violating the ceasefire agreement shortly after it began.",
      "\"I'm not happy with Israel. OK, when I say now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either,\" Trump said to reporters Tuesday morning.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson said late Monday that he expects the House briefing to have a different \"tone\" in the light of the ceasefire.",

      "\"We're in the middle of a war -- you don't see it? Day in and day out, when you turn on the TV news and you see a president named Mr. Trump. Have you seen President Trump on TV?\"",

He's declared war on working families, he's declared war on immigrants, he's declared war on minorities, and he's declared war on New York City and New York State.\" He later told reporters, \"Good news is -- we beat [the administration] once before, and we're going to beat them again.\"",
      "In the final days of campaigning for Tuesday's New York City ranked choice Democratic mayoral primary, which has 11 candidates on the ballot, Cuomo and others fanned out across the city to make their closing arguments, with one shared focus being how they're framing themselves as the best choice to stand up to the White House.",
      "Curtis Sliwa, who lost to Mayor Eric Adams in 2021, is the only Republican running for mayor.",
      "Voters, meanwhile, told ABC News they're looking at both national and local issues -- particularly affordability -- as they decide who to cast votes for.",
      "And scorching high temperatures in New York City could impact turnout on Election Day, as voters brave the heat to trudge to their polling places on Tuesday, with the city's election board preparing for dehydration, and even potential heat-related power outages.",
      "The New York City Board of Elections said last week in a news release that it is making sure polling sites that don't have air conditioning will have fans, a \"steady supply of water.\" The board said it is working with emergency management and utility providers to make sure polling places don't lose power, too.",
      "A spokesperson for the board told City & State NY that potential heat-induced blackouts might impact vote counting, since then ballots would need to be counted similarly to absentee or affidavit ballots that get scanned later.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, meanwhile, signed legislation over the weekend allowing voters to receive refreshments while in line to vote.",
      "In an email sent to supporters on Tuesday to supporters, Cuomo asked voters to \"vote as early as you can to avoid the hottest parts of the day.\"",
      "For Cuomo, the election could mark his political comeback. His governorship was derailed after several women accused him of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct. He resigned as governor in 2021 but has consistently denied the allegations. One voter in downtown Manhattan told ABC News that she is voting for Cuomo despite misgivings over the allegations, mentioning that he had issued an apology in 2021.",
      "Carmen S., a medical assistant who lives in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, told ABC News in an interview that immigration policy is one of the important issues in the race, becoming emotional speaking about the White House's immigration policies. She declined to provide her full last name.",
      "\"I'm a child of immigrants,\" she said. \"Not every immigrant is a criminal.\"",
      "While she didn't share who she ranked on her ballot, she praised Cuomo for his record and how he handled his job as governor.",
      "Cuomo's main opponent in the primary is state assembly member Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist whose progressive economic plans have galvanized many voters.",
      "Mamdani, in an interview with ABC News on Thursday in Astoria, Queens, just hours after he voted early at a polling site in the Museum of the Moving Image, said his closing argument is that he is the one who can take on the \"twin crises\" facing the city: \"Authoritarianism from the outside and an affordability crisis from the inside.\"",
      "\"And what we need is a mayor who's able to stand up to both of those and deliver a city that every New Yorker can afford and that every New Yorker understands that they belong to,\" Mamdani told ABC News.",
      "And as to why should people around the country care about this race, he said, \"This is a referendum on where our party goes; it is a referendum on whether billionaires and corporations can buy yet another election, or if we opt for a new generation of leadership, one that isn't funded by Trump donors, one that is actually able to stand up and fight for working class New Yorkers.\"",
      "That outlook has impressed some voters. Angela Pham, a 38-year-old content designer who lives in Greenwich Village, told ABC News in an interview after voting early that Mamdani \"needs to win.\"",
      "\"We're supposed to be the most progressive city in America,\" she said. \"I feel like he's the only candidate that makes sense for the things that we need to happen.\"",
      "Asked how she felt about Cuomo, Pham said, \"He needs to get out of politics and retire to a farm.\"",
      "Mamdani has faced some pushback over his criticism of Israel, given New York's large Jewish population. In response, he has emphasized policies to combat antisemitism and said that he wants to focus on city issues.",
      "Cuomo has criticized Mamdani's comments about Israel and made combatting antisemitism a key campaign focus. One voter in Greenwich Village told ABC News that concerns about antisemitism were a main driver for his decision to vote for Cuomo.",
      "Fellow candidate New York City comptroller Brad Lander, who has \"cross-endorsed\" Mamdani, has received less momentum in polling but has gotten heightened attention since he was briefly detained last week by federal agents while escorting a defendant out of immigration court.",
      "Lander, speaking with ABC News on Thursday on the Upper East Side near an early voting site at a school, said that the mayoral election in the city has national implications, because the administration has said it hopes to \"\"liberate\" Democratic cities from their elected officials. That's [a] code word for a federal government takeover, an erosion of democracy, a denial of due process,\" Lander said.",
      "\"Democracy is on the line right now,\" he added.",
      "Officials from the White House and administration have said their actions towards cities such as Los Angeles are meant to restore order amidst protests and unrest.",

      "That ruling required migrants scheduled for deportation to a country other than their place of origin to have the opportunity to assert if they face \"grave danger or death because of such a deportation\" and gave them a \"minimum of 15 days\" to seek to reopen immigration proceedings challenging their potential removal.",
      "The eight men in question, who were convicted of violent crimes, were given notices of removal from the U.S. to the East African country of South Sudan -- but after Judge Murphy blocked the administration's attempt to deport the group to South Sudan without giving them a sufficient chance to contest their removal, the group disembarked in Djibouti, where they remain on a military base under perilous conditions.",
      "The Supreme Court's order on Monday allows the Trump administration to restart expedited removals of migrants to countries other than their own.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer, in the motion filed on Tuesday to the Supreme Court, called Judge Murphy's ruling \"a lawless act of defiance\" that \"slams the brakes on the Executive's lawful efforts to effectuate third-country removals.\"",

      "In his motion, Sauer argued that the May 21 order Judge Murphy issued protecting the men in Djibouti from imminent removal is \"not a separate injunction\" and that it \"merely enforced the original April 18 injunction\" that the Supreme Court stayed.",
      "\"The district court's injunction has created an unstable and dangerous situation at the military base in Djibouti -- a situation that has become all the more dangerous given current events in the Middle East,\" Sauer argued.",

      "He posted his efforts to broker a deal in real time on his social media site.",
      "The past 24 hours in the Israel-Iran war have been been highlighted by President Donald Trump's whirlwind diplomatic efforts, aimed at being seen as a peacemaker amid the conflict.",
      "The world seesawed between fears of escalation as Iran retaliated against the United States to Trump's surprise ceasefire announcement to his angry comments about early violations from both countries.",
      "Notably, the president narrated the fast-changing developments in real time on his conservative social media site, showing, in often personal terms, his style of dealmaking diplomacy -- and his mounting frustration with both sides.",
      "Here's how the sometimes dizzying sequence of events unfolded.",
      "Alarms were raised when when Tehran, in response to the U.S. strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities over the weekend, retaliated on Monday by firing missiles at Al Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. military base in the region.",
      "Reports of the attack came in around 1 p.m. ET on Monday. The U.S. shot down the missiles with assistance from Qatar. No injuries or extensive damage were reported.",
      "Although Trump had threatened a massive response if Iran retaliated, raising fears of escalation, he issued a statement on his social media account about 4 p.m. ET calling the attack \"very weak\" and said it was \"very effectively countered,\" not mentioning any military action.",
      "\"I am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed, and hardly any damage was done. Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their 'system,' and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE,\" the president wrote. \"I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured.\"",
      "\"Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" he wrote.",
      "The, at 6:08 p.m. ET, Trump, in a bombshell post, announced a ceasefire agreement he said would end the war within 24 hours.",
      "The agreement described by Trump involved two 12-hour ceasefire periods that would come \"when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Iran would start the ceasefire for the first 12 hours, Trump said, and Israel would then follow with a second 12-hour ceasefire. When that period was over, Trump said, \"an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World.\"",
      "\"It's a great day for America. It's a great day for the Middle East. I'm very happy to have been able to get the job done,\" Trump told NBC News, taking credit. \"I think the ceasefire is unlimited. It's going to go forever.\"",
      "In the immediate aftermath of Trump's announcement, however, neither Israeli nor Iranian officials publicly commented on the proposal.",
      "At 1:08 a.m. ET, Trump posted: \"THE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!\"",
      "In the final hours before the ceasefire was set to go into effect, Israel and Iran launched a barrage of missiles. Israel said four people were killed and 20 injured as Iranian missiles hit Beersheba. Iran said at least 15 people were killed in strikes around the country.",
      "Then, came reports of exchanged fire in the opening hours of the ceasefire.",
      "Israel said Iran violated the ceasefire agreement by launching missiles between midnight and 3:30 a.m. ET, which Israel said were intercepted or fell in open areas. Iran denied firing the missiles.",
      "Israel then acknowledged its Air Force \"destroyed a radar installation near Tehran\" in response to the alleged violations.",
      "In some startlingly blunt comments, Trump showed his frustration with both Iran and Israel as he departed the White House around 6:30 a.m. ET to attend a NATO summit in the Netherlands.",
      "\"Israel as soon as we made the deal, they came out and dropped a boatload of bombs the likes of which I've never seen before,\" Trump said. \"The biggest load that we've seen, I'm not happy with Israel. Ok, when I say now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So, I'm not happy with him. I'm not happy with Iran either.\"",
      "While he accused both nations of violating the ceasefire, much of his ire was aimed toward Israel, in language rarely heard from a president in public.",
      "\"We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard, that they don't know what the f--- they're doing. Do you understand that?\" a visibly angry Trump told ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott when asked if both nations were committed to peace, before turning away to board his Marine One helicopter.",
      "Soon after, he fired off a warning to Israel on social media -- in all capital letters -- to stop attacking Iran.",
      "During the morning, Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sources familiar with the call told ABC News. A White House source, in a readout of the call, said Trump was firm and direct with Netanyahu about what was necessary to sustain the ceasefire.",
      "\"ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly 'Plane Wave' to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!\" Trump wrote.",
      "Once aboard Air Force One, on his way to the Netherlands, he told reporters he wasn't thinking about consequences for Israel when he warned against retaliation, claiming \"they didn't do anything\" because of his post on social media.",
      "The Israeli prime minister's office said in a statement that Israel has \"refrained from additional attacks\" on Iran following the conversation between Trump and Netanyahu.",
      "Iran said it won't violate the ceasefire unless Israel does, according to Iran\u2019s state-run media.",
      "As of Tuesday afternoon, the fragile ceasefire appeared to be holding, 24 hours after Iran retaliated against the U.S.",

      "The demonstration followed other anti-Bezos initiatives last week including a banner draped from the San Giorgio bell tower, one from the lagoon city\u2019s famous Rialto Bridge and posters plastered up around town complaining about the upcoming wedding and the effects of overtourism on Venice.",
      "The \u201cNo Space for Bezos\u201d movement \u2014 a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight \u2014 has united a dozen Venetian organizations including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups.",
      "Activists argue the wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over resident needs.",
      "Greenpeace said it teamed with the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, for Monday\u2019s banner. Greenpeace said it wanted to draw attention to the comparitively low taxes many billionaires pay while allegedly exacerbating the climate crisis with environmentally unsustainable lifestyles.",
      "Italian and Venetian officials have strongly criticized the protests and welcomed the Bezos-Sanchez nuptials, which are scheduled for later this week.",
      "Over the weekend, as the protests continued to make headlines in Italy, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, said Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d",
      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but noted contacts began in April, well before the protests started.",

      "\u201cWhen something like this happens at a school event, it shakes people to the core,\u201d Willis said.",
      "Students from several high schools in the Frisco Independent School District were competing when the stabbing occurred. According to an arrest report, a witness said that when Anthony sat under the tent belonging to Metcalf's team, Metcalf told Anthony to move, and Anthony replied: \u201cTouch me and see what happens.\"",
      "Metcalf then touched Anthony, and Anthony said to punch him and see what happens, the arrest report said. A short time later, Metcalf grabbed Anthony and Anthony stabbed him with a knife, the report said.",

      "North Carolina trial judges have issued a mixed ruling for Democratic Gov. Josh Stein and Republican legislative leaders in litigation over recent law changes that eroded gubernatorial powers",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina trial judges issued a mixed ruling Tuesday for Democratic Gov. Josh Stein and Republican legislative leaders in Stein's litigation over recent law changes that eroded the governor\u2019s powers to appoint members to state boards and to fill appeals court vacancies.",
      "A three-judge panel unanimously sided with Stein and struck down as unconstitutional a portion of a law that placed some limits on whom the governor could choose to fill vacancies on the seven-member state Supreme Court and 15-member intermediate-level Court of Appeals.",
      "But the Superior Court judges let stand a pair of provisions that take away some of Stein\u2019s appointments to the state Utilities Commission and Building Code Council.",
      "In a brief order issued after two hours of arguments earlier in the day, Superior Court Judges James Ammons, Graham Shirley and Imelda Pate wrote that Stein \u201cfailed to demonstrate, beyond reasonable doubt,\u201d that the alterations involving the two state boards were unconstitutional.",
      "The order, which can be appealed, is the latest result from lawsuits that Stein or his fellow Democrat and predecessor Roy Cooper filed in recent years to attempt to counter measures approved by the Republican-controlled legislature that they say weaken gubernatorial control and the separation of powers between government branches. Several lawsuits have focused on the State Board of Elections.",
      "The state constitution says the governor fills appellate court vacancies. Appointees must be licensed to practice law in North Carolina.",
      "But the law approved last December directed the governor to fill such a vacancy from a list of three people offered by the political party with which the departing judge or justice was affiliated when elected. That limitation wouldn\u2019t apply if the court judge was unaffiliated at the time, or if the party didn\u2019t provide the list quickly.",
      "Stein attorney Daniel Smith told the judges that legal scholars \u2014 among them the current chief justice \u2014 have said the governor has an \u201cunfettered power of appointment\u201d for these vacancies, which fill positions until the next statewide election.",
      "Shirley pushed back on arguments by Noah Huffstetler \u2014 an attorney for House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger \u2014 that since the constitution doesn\u2019t specifically forbid conditions on these appointments, the legislature can act to add some.",
      "The panel declined to block the latest changes to the Utilities Commission, which regulates electricity, natural gas and other public utilities. Beginning next month, the commission will decrease to five members.",
      "Without the December law, the retooled commission would be composed of three members appointed by the governor and two by the General Assembly. But the challenged law gave one of the governor\u2019s three appointments to the elected state treasurer, currently Republican Brad Briner. His nominee is set to take his post in July.",
      "Stein\u2019s attorneys argued that the change would dilute the governor\u2019s powers and prevent him from controlling the commission to make sure utilities regulations are enforced. But GOP leaders countered that they can assign duties to other statewide elected executive officials known as the Council of State.",
      "Briner, who joined the case to help defend the law, said Tuesday's decision affirms that \u201cthe governor does not have ultimate authority over other duly elected members of the Council of State to carry out their roles and responsibilities as members of the executive branch.\u201d",
      "The panel also let stand General Assembly changes to the Building Code Council, whose members have been appointed solely by the governor.",
      "Under the new law, the governor still would appoint seven of the 13 members, with legislative leaders choosing six. Stein\u2019s lawyers say he\u2019ll lack sufficient control over the revised board because code changes and other action couldn\u2019t be approved unless nine members agree.",
      "Stein's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Pate is a registered Democrat, while Ammons is unaffiliated. Shirley ran unsuccessfully for another court term in 2024 as a Republican. He became a special Superior Court judge this year.",
      "Just last week another three-judge panel dismissed a lawsuit filed by Stein that challenged another law from December directing that current State Highway Patrol Col. Freddy Johnson remain patrol commander until 2030.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A Washington state man who was charged with aiding the bomber of a fertility clinic in Southern California died Tuesday in federal custody, just weeks after his arrest, prison officials said.",
      "Daniel Park, 32, was accused of supplying chemicals to Guy Edward Bartkus of California, the bomber, who died in the May 17 explosion.",
      "Park, of suburban Seattle, was found unresponsive at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles Tuesday morning and was pronounced dead at a hospital, the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement. No cause of death was provided.",
      "The two men connected in fringe online forums over their shared beliefs against human procreation, investigators said. The blast gutted the clinic in Palm Springs, east of Los Angeles, and shattered the windows of nearby buildings, with officials calling the attack terrorism. The facility was closed, and no embryos were damaged.",
      "Park shipped 180 pounds (about 82 kilograms) of ammonium nitrate to Bartkus in January and bought another 90 pounds (about 41 kilograms) and had it shipped to him days before the explosion, investigators said. Park purchased ammonium nitrate online in several transactions between October 2022 and May 2025, according to a federal complaint.",
      "Authorities said Park traveled to Twentynine Palms, California, near Palm Springs, to experiment with explosives in Bartkus\u2019 garage months before the attack.",
      "Three days before Park visited him in January, Bartkus asked an AI chat application about explosives, detonation velocity, diesel and gasoline mixtures, the complaint said. The discussion centered on how to create the most powerful blast.",
      "Park was taken into custody at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport on June 3, after he was extradited from Poland, where he fled four days after the attack. Park had been charged with providing and attempting to provide material support to terrorists. He had been at Metropolitan Detention Center since June 13, federal prison officials said.",
      "The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California, which is prosecuting the case, referred questions about Park\u2019s death to the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "Park and Bartkus bonded over a \u201cshared belief that people shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d Akil Davis, the FBI\u2019s assistant director in charge, said earlier this month.",
      "They believed in anti-natalism, a fringe theory that opposes childbirth and population growth and contends that people should not continue to procreate. Officials said Bartkus intentionally targeted the American Reproductive Centers, a clinic that provides services to help people get pregnant, including in vitro fertilization and fertility evaluations.",
      "Park appeared to be a frequent poster in an anti-natalist Reddit forum going back nearly a decade, according to court papers. In 2016, he spoke of recruiting others to the movement, which he described as hopeful.",
      "According to court papers, he wrote: \u201cWhen people are lost and distraught, death is always an option.\u201d",
      "Relatives told federal investigators that Park had made \u201cpro-mortalist\u201d statements since high school, according to the complaint.",
      "More recently, in March, he posted in the forum to say he was seeking to find fellow anti-natalists in and around Washington state to \u201cstart some protests or just any in-person events,\u201d according to court papers. The post did not receive any public comments.",
      "The Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles is also used to detain people arrested for immigration violations. It's been the site of many recent protests over President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, and Trump has deployed the National Guard to stand guard outside the facility.",

      "A plan to sell more than 3,200 square miles of federal lands has been ruled out of Republicans\u2019 big tax and spending cut bill after the Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal by Senate Energy Chairman Mike Lee would violate the chamber\u2019s rules",
      "WASHINGTON -- A plan to sell more than 3,200 square miles of federal lands has been ruled out of Republicans\u2019 big tax and spending cut bill after the Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal by Senate Energy Chairman Mike Lee would violate the chamber\u2019s rules.",
      "Lee, a Utah Republican, has proposed selling millions of acres (8.300 square kilometers) of public lands in the West to states or other entities for use as housing or infrastructure. The plan would revive a longtime ambition of Western conservatives to cede lands to local control after a similar proposal failed in the House earlier this year.",
      "Lee's plan has revealed sharp disagreement among Republicans who support wholesale transfers of federal property to spur development and generate revenue, and other lawmakers \u2014 including GOP senators in Montana and Idaho \u2014 who are staunchly opposed.",
      "The proposal comes as the Trump administration said Monday it will move to rescind a 2001 rule that blocked logging on national forest lands. The so-called roadless rule has angered Republicans, especially in the West where forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "Democrats and environmental groups roundly oppose both plans as giveaways to private interests that will threaten clean water and wildlife and block recreation on public lands.",
      "\u201cDemocrats will not stand idly by while Republicans attempt to circumvent the rules of (budget) reconciliation in order to sell off public lands to fund tax breaks for billionaires,'' said Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee.",
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said her constituents want to be able to hike and hunt on public lands, as they have for generations all over the West. \"They don't want these lands to be luxury resorts or golf courses,'' she said at a news conference Tuesday.",
      "Lee, in a post on X Monday night, said he would keep trying.",
      "\u201cHousing prices are crushing families and keeping young Americans from living where they grew up. We need to change that,'' he wrote, adding that a revised plan would remove all U.S. Forest Service land from possible sale. Sales of sites controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management would be significantly reduced, Lee said, so that only land within 5 miles of population centers could be sold.",
      "Environmental advocates celebrated the ruling late Monday by Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough but cautioned that Lee's proposal was far from dead.",
      "\u201cThis is a victory for the American public, who were loud and clear: Public lands belong in public hands, for current and future generations alike,'' said Tracy Stone-Manning, president of The Wilderness Society. \u201cOur public lands are not for sale.\u201d",
      "Carrie Besnette Hauser, president and CEO of the nonprofit Trust for Public Land, called the procedural ruling in the Senate \u201can important victory in the fight to protect America\u2019s public lands from short-sighted proposals that would have undermined decades of bipartisan work to protect, steward and expand access to the places we all share.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut make no mistake: this threat is far from over,\u201d Hauser added. \u201cEfforts to dismantle our public lands continue, and we must remain vigilant as proposals now under consideration,\" including plans to roll back the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act and cut funding for land and water conservation, make their way through Congress, she said.",
      "MacDonough, the Senate parliamentarian, also ruled out a host of other Republican-led provisions Monday night, including construction of a mining road in Alaska and changes to speed permitting of oil and gas leases on federal lands.",
      "While the parliamentarian\u2019s rulings are advisory, they are rarely, if ever, ignored. Lawmakers are using a budget reconciliation process to bypass the Senate filibuster to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s tax-cut package by a self-imposed July 4 deadline.",
      "Under Lee's plan, land in 11 Western states from Alaska to New Mexico would be eligible for sale. Montana was carved out of the proposal after lawmakers there objected. In states such as Utah and Nevada, the government controls the vast majority of lands, protecting them from potential exploitation but hindering growth.",
      "\"Washington has proven time and again it can\u2019t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands,\u201d Lee said in announcing the plan earlier this month.",
      "The proposal received a mixed reception Monday from the governors of Western states. Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham called it problematic in her state because of the close relationship residents have with public lands.",
      "Republican Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon voiced qualified support. \u201cOn a piece-by-piece basis ... we can actually allow for some responsible growth in areas with communities that are landlocked at this point,\u201d he said at a meeting of the Western Governors\u2019 Association in Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Housing advocates have cautioned that federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing. Some of the parcels up for sale in Utah and Nevada under a House proposal were many miles from developed areas.",
      "New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the energy committee, said Lee's plan would exclude Americans from places where they fish, hunt and camp.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s clear that we would even get substantial housing as a result of this,\u201d Heinrich said earlier this month. \u201cWhat I know would happen is people would lose access to places they know and care about and that drive our Western economies.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The temperature in New York City has reached 100 degrees as the eastern U.S. sweltered under an extreme heat wave",
      "NEW YORK -- Extensive triple digit heat, broken temperature records and oppressive humidity piled up into a steaming mess as the heat dome crushing the Eastern half of the nation sizzled to what should be its worst Tuesday.",
      "New York City\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) a little after noon, the first time since 2013. Then Baltimore, Philadelphia and Boston joined the 100 club. More than 150 million people woke up to heat warnings and forecasters at the National Weather Service expected dozens of places to tie or set new daily high temperature records Tuesday. The dangerous heat sent people to the hospital, delayed Amtrak trains and caused utilities to urge customers to conserve power.",
      "\u201cEvery East Coast state today from Maine to Florida has a chance of 100 degree actual temperature,\u201d said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist.",
      "Fryeburg, Maine, also hit 100, for the first time since 2011.",
      "\u201cGetting Maine to 100 degrees is infrequent,\u201d Maue said.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s heat came on top of 39 new or tied heat records Monday. But just as dangerous as triple digit heat is the lack of cooling at night, driven by the humidity.",
      "\u201cYou get the combination of the extreme heat and humidity but no relief,\u201d said Jacob Asherman, a meteorologist at NOAA\u2019s Weather Prediction Center. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of been just everything stacked on top of itself.... It just speaks to how strong this heat wave is. This is a pretty, pretty extreme event.\u201d",
      "Asherman and Maue said Tuesday is the peak of the high pressure system that sits on top of the Mid-Atlantic and keeps the heat and humidity turned up several notches.",
      "\u201cNobody is immune to the heat,\u201d said Kimberly McMahon, the weather service public services program manager who specializes in heat and health.",
      "Dozens attending outdoor high school graduation ceremonies in a northern New Jersey city on Monday were treated for heat exhaustion and related problems, including 16 taken to hospitals. The Paterson school district held ceremonies in the morning and the afternoon as temperatures soared to nearly 100 degrees. Officials halted the second ceremony about an hour after it had started due to the heat.",
      "And in New Hampshire, two 16-year-old hikers were rescued from a mountain in Jaffrey late Monday afternoon, overcome by the heat, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said. They were described as being in and out of consciousness and taken to a hospital.",
      "The heat hit New York City as residents headed to the polls for the city\u2019s primary election. In Queens, Rekha Malhotra was handing out flyers in support of Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani while wearing a pink electric fan around their neck.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 90 bazillian degrees and here I am,\u201d said Malhotra. \u201cI could have been phone banking.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have all the things \u2014 hat, ice and this,\u201d Malhotra added, clutching a commercial-grade spray bottle.",
      "Utilities across the Midwest and East braced for the surge of extra demand in the heat, at times asking people to cut back on air conditioning when it felt like it was needed the most. In Memphis, Tennessee, residents were asked to turn off unnecessary lights and electronics, wait until nighttime to use dishwashers, washing machines dryers, and raise thermostats a few degrees, if health allows.",
      "The heat and humidity during the day was compounded by humid nights where the temperatures don\u2019t drop much and the human body and the electric bill don\u2019t get a break to recover, said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central.",
      "\u201cThe longer the heat lasts, the more it wears on the body, the more it wears on the health,\u201d Woods Placky said.",
      "A good rule of thumb is the temperature has to get at least as low as 75 degrees, if not lower, for people to recover, McMahon said. That\u2019s a lesson from the Pacific Northwest heat wave of 2021, when many of the deaths were older people who lived at home and died at night because it wasn\u2019t getting cool enough, she said.",
      "\u201cUnlike other weather hazards, heat does have that compounding effect on the human body. Your body tolerates less and less heat as the days go on,\u201d McMahon said.",
      "Because warmer air from human-caused climate change holds more moisture, making it more humid, summer nights are actually heating up faster than summer days, Woods Placky said. That\u2019s why the Dust Bowl of the 1930s hit high temperatures similar to now, but it wasn\u2019t as warm overall because the nights cooled, she said.",
      "The United States daytime summer high temperature has increased 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1975, but the nighttime lowest temperature is now on average 2.6 degrees higher, according to NOAA data. In Baltimore, summer nights have warmed 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1975, while summer days only 1.5 degrees, the data showed.",
      "Marc Savenor, who owns Acme Ice and Dry Ice Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, struggled to keep up with phones ringing as the heat wave overwhelmed ice machines and refrigerators, forcing customers to seek emergency supplies.",
      "\u201cDuring the heat waves, my phone will ring at 3 in the morning till 11 at night,\u201d Savenor said as workers shoveled dry ice into pellets. \u201cThere\u2019s no help for the weary here, because you\u2019ve got to get it when it\u2019s coming in and everybody wants some.\u201d",
      "Air conditioners and fans have been flying off the shelves at Khan Electronics in Queens, owner Mudassar Khan said.",
      "\u201cIt started getting hot at night. People buy air conditioners when they feel uncomfortable at night,\u201d Khan said.",
      "\u201cRelief is coming,\u201d Maue said, predicting that on Friday, New York City probably won't even get into the 70s. \u201cIt'll feel incredible.\u201d",

      "IOWA CITY, Iowa -- A powerful U.S. senator on Tuesday called on the Trump administration to fix a growing backlog and longtime management problems at the program that promises benefits when police and firefighters die or become disabled in the line of duty.",
      "Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits program is failing the spouses and children of deceased and disabled first responders and needs new leadership. He said the mismanagement has caused significant hardship for grieving families, who often experience yearslong delays in processing and approving claims.",
      "\u201cThis is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d he wrote in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, in which he suggested she consider replacing longtime program leader Hope Janke.",
      "Grassley's letter comes days after The Associated Press published an investigation detailing the claims backlog at the program, which provides a nearly $450,000 one-time payment to the families of deceased and disabled officers and firefighters in addition to education benefits.",
      "The AP found dozens of families are waiting five years or more to learn whether they qualify for the life-changing payments, and more are being denied. As of late April, nearly 900 claims had been pending for more than one year, more than triple the number from five years ago, with a small number languishing for a decade.",
      "Grassley cited a Government Accountability Office report issued last year that detailed deficiencies in the program's management dating back to 2009. He said the program had failed to make changes recommended by outside reviewers but that \u201cgovernment bureaucrats\u201d such as Janke have never been held accountable.",
      "Janke has not responded to AP emails seeking comment, including one Tuesday. A request for comment to the DOJ wasn't immediately returned.",
      "DOJ officials said earlier this year that they are adopting several recommendations from the GAO, including improvements to make the program's electronic claims management system more user-friendly. They say they are responding to a surge of claims after Congress has made more categories of deaths and injuries eligible for benefits.",
      "Grassley demanded the DOJ provide updates and documents within two weeks related to the status of those changes.",
      "Texas widow Lisa Afolayan, who is still fighting the program for benefits 16 years after her husband died while training for the Border Patrol, welcomed Grassley's oversight of the program.",
      "\u201cWe need movement. We need change and not only for my family,\u201d she said. \u201cThey've lost sight of why the program was started.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- Atlanta police said Tuesday they're charging three men and a juvenile with hate crimes after they pulled down LGBTQ+ pride flags and cut them up at an intersection known as the center of the city's LGBTQ+ community.",
      "Police say they got calls at 1:40 a.m. Tuesday morning that six males were causing a disturbance near the corner of Piedmont Avenue and 10th Street, an intersection in the city's Midtown neighborhood that is painted with rainbow crosswalks to honor its importance in Atlanta's LGBTQ+ community.",
      "The men coordinated their plan and drove to Atlanta from their locations northwest of the city, police said. Officers are still looking for two of the six people who they believe took part.",
      "Investigators said they found the people pulling down flags outside Blake's on the Park, a bar near the intersection, cutting them up with a knife and taking videos of what they were doing. The males fled from police on motorized scooters, investigators said, with officers catching and arresting four of them.",
      "Two 18-year-olds and a 17-year-old from Dallas, Georgia, were taken into custody, in addition to a 16-year-old from Taylorsville. Police said all four were also charged with obstruction, criminal damage to property, conspiracy, and prowling. Georgia is one of three states where 17-year-old suspects are automatically charged as adults.",
      "Police said they have also cited the 16-year-old's father for failing to supervise his son.",
      "The arrests come at the end of what is marked as Pride Month in many places, although Atlanta's main festival is held in October.",
      "In 2022, police arrested a man who they said had twice painted swastikas on the rainbow crosswalks. The crosswalks were first painted in 2015 and were made permanent in 2017 to memorialize the 49 people who were killed in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Supreme Court delivered a victory for environmentalists on Tuesday in the fight over \u201cforever chemicals\u201d known as PFAS, issuing a ruling that advocates said will hold polluters accountable.",
      "The liberal-controlled court ruled that state regulators can force landowners to clean up emerging pollutants such as PFAS before they are officially designated as hazardous substances.",
      "The 5-2 ruling is a defeat for the state's powerful group representing businesses and manufacturers, which had argued the state couldn't enforce regulations on substances before they were officially designated as hazardous.",
      "It is the latest development in a yearslong battle in Wisconsin and nationally involving regulators, environmentalists, politicians and businesses over how to deal with PFAS contamination.",
      "Cities large and small across Wisconsin, from Madison to Marinette and La Crosse to Wausau, are grappling with PFAS contamination.",
      "PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation\u2019s air, water and soil.",
      "They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.",
      "The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment and have a hard time breaking down in the body. There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS, including low birth weight, cancer and liver disease.",
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in a case brought by the state's largest business group, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, which sued the DNR in 2021 on behalf of Leather Rich, a dry cleaning business in Oconomowoc.",
      "Leather Rich became aware of PFAS contamination in 2018 and was working on cleaning it up when the DNR posted a message online in 2019 saying it now considered PFAS chemicals a hazardous substance. The agency ordered the dry cleaner to test its groundwater for PFAS but didn\u2019t tell the business which compounds it needed to test for or what levels would be considered dangerous.",
      "They argued the DNR can't force businesses to test and clean up contamination from emerging pollutants like PFAS without first designating them as hazardous substances. That process can take years and requires approval from the Legislature. All that time, polluters could harm the environment and put people's health and safety at risk with no obligation to begin cleanup, the DNR argued.",
      "But Leather Rich argued that businesses have a right to know which substances are subject to regulation before spending time and money on cleanup.",
      "A Waukesha County judge and the state appeals court sided with Leather Rich.",
      "The DNR appealed, saying the lower court\u2019s ruling would neuter the state's \u201cspills law,\u201d which was designed to confront pollution.",
      "That law, enacted about 50 years ago, requires anyone who causes, possesses or controls a hazardous substance that\u2019s been released into the environment to clean it up.",
      "\u201cWisconsin\u2019s Spills Law safeguards human health and the environment in real time by directly regulating parties responsible for a hazardous substance discharge,\u201d Justice Janet Protasiewicz wrote for the majority.",
      "No state law required the DNR to implement a rule before requiring Leather Rich to begin cleaning up the site, she wrote.",
      "\u201cThe DNR has explicit authority to enforce a threshold for reporting the discharge of hazardous substances,\u201d Protasiewicz wrote.",
      "The court\u2019s four liberal justices were joined by conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn in the majority. Conservative justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley dissented.",
      "They said the ruling allows bureaucrats to \u201cimpose rules and penalties on the governed without advance notice, oversight, or deliberation. In doing so, the majority violates three first principles fundamental to preserving the rule of law \u2014 and liberty.\u201d",
      "Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and environmental advocates hailed the decision.",
      "\u201cThis is a historic victory for the people of Wisconsin and my administration\u2019s fight against PFAS and other harmful contaminants that are affecting families and communities across our state,\" Evers said in a statement.",
      "Rob Lee, attorney for Midwest Environmental Advocates, called the ruling \u201ca victory for the health and wellbeing of the people of Wisconsin\" that reinforces \u201ca bedrock environmental and public health protection that has kept Wisconsinites safe from toxic contamination for almost fifty years.\"",
      "A spokesperson for WMC, which brought the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Since the lawsuit was filed, additional state and federal regulations of PFAS have been put in place.",
      "Federal regulators placed the first-ever national standards on PFAS in drinking water last year, but the Trump administration said in May that it planned to weaken those limits.",
      "The state has imposed less restrictive limits on PFAS in surface and drinking water, defined as piped water delivered through public systems and noncommunity systems that serve places such as factories, schools and hotels.",
      "But it has not implemented PFAS standards for groundwater, the source of drinking water for about two-thirds of Wisconsin residents. The agency stopped efforts to draft them in 2023 after determining that compliance would be too expensive.",

      "The Zizians are a group of followers of Jack LaSota, a computer scientist who has blogged as \u201cZiz\u201d on subjects including veganism, gender identity and artificial intelligence. The group mostly consists of computer scientists who met online, shared anarchist beliefs and became increasingly violent.",

Youngblut has pleaded not guilty to charges of intentionally using a deadly weapon towards law enforcement, and using and discharging a firearm during an assault with a deadly weapon.",

      "A man convicted of raping and killing a woman near a central Florida bar is scheduled to be executed",
      "STARKE, Fla. -- A man convicted of raping and killing a woman near a central Florida bar is scheduled to be executed Tuesday.",
      "Thomas Lee Gudinas, 51, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke, barring a last-day reprieve. He was convicted in the May 1994 killing of Michelle McGrath.",
      "Gudinas would be the seventh person put to death in Florida this year, with an eighth scheduled for next month. The state also executed six people in 2023, but only carried out one execution last year.",
      "A total of 23 men have been executed in the U.S. this year, with scheduled executions set to make 2025 the year with the most executions since 2015.",
      "Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, while Texas and South Carolina are tied for second place with four each. Alabama has executed three people, Oklahoma has killed two, and Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana and Tennessee each have one. Mississippi is set to join the other states on Wednesday with its first execution since 2022.",
      "McGrath was last seen at a bar called Barbarella\u2019s shortly before 3 a.m. on May 24, 1994. Her body was found with evidence of serious trauma and sexual assault in an alley next to a nearby school several hours later.",
      "Gudinas had been at the same bar with friends the night before, but they all later testified that they had left without him. A school employee who found McGrath\u2019s body later identified Gudinas as a man who was fleeing the area shortly beforehand. Another woman also identified Gudinas as the person who chased her to her car the previous night and threatened to assault her.",
      "Gudinas was convicted and sentenced to death in 1995.",
      "Attorneys for Gudinas have filed appeals with the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The lawyers argue in their state filing that evidence related to \u201clifelong mental illnesses\u201d exempts Gudinas from being put to death. The Florida Supreme Court denied the appeals last week, ruling that the case law that shields intellectually disabled people from execution does not apply to individuals with other forms of mental illness or brain damage.",
      "Meanwhile, a federal filing argues that the Florida governor's unfettered discretion to sign death warrants violates death row inmates' constitutional rights to due process and has led to an arbitrary process for determining who lives and who dies. The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet released its decision.",

      "New York City voters will decide whether Andrew Cuomo has done enough to make a political comeback by winning the Democratic mayoral primary",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City Democrats will decide Tuesday whether to reboot Andrew Cuomo's political career, elevate liberal upstart Zohran Mamdani, or turn to a crowded field of lesser-known but maybe less-polarizing candidates in the party's mayoral primary.",
      "Their choice could say something about what kind of leader Democrats are looking for during President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "The vote takes place on a sweltering day about four years after Cuomo resigned as governor following a sexual harassment scandal. Yet the 67-year-old has been the favorite throughout the race, with his deep experience, nearly universal name recognition, strong political connections and juggernaut fundraising apparatus.",
      "The party's progressive wing, meanwhile, has coalesced behind Mamdani, a 33-year-old self-described democratic socialist. A relatively unknown state legislator when the contest began, Mamdani gained momentum by running a sharp campaign laser-focused on the city's high cost of living and secured endorsements from two of the country's foremost progressives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.",
      "While preliminary returns will be released after the polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday, a winner might not emerge for a week because of the city's ranked choice voting system, which allows voters to list up to five candidates in order of preference. If a candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters, they win outright. If no candidate reaches that threshold, the tabulation of the rankings wouldn\u2019t begin until July 1.",
      "The primary winner will go on to face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who decided to run as an independent amid a public uproar over his indictment on corruption charges and the subsequent abandonment of the case by Trump's Justice Department. Republican Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, will be on the ballot in the fall's general election.",
      "The mayoral primary\u2019s two leading candidates \u2014 one a fresh-faced progressive and the other an older moderate \u2014 could be stand-ins for the larger Democratic Party\u2019s ideological divide, though Cuomo\u2019s scandal-scarred past adds a unique tinge to the narrative.",
      "The rest of the pack has struggled to gain recognition in a race where nearly every candidate has cast themselves as the person best positioned to challenge Trump's Republican agenda.",
      "Comptroller Brad Lander, a liberal city government stalwart, made a splash last week when he was arrested after linking arms with a man federal agents were trying to detain at an immigration court in Manhattan. It was unclear if that episode was enough to jumpstart a campaign that had been failing to pick up speed behind Lander\u2019s wonkish vibe.",
      "Among the other candidates are City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, hedge fund executive Whitney Tilson and former city Comptroller Scott Stringer.",
      "Mamdani's energetic run has been hard not to notice.",
      "His army of young hipster canvassers relentlessly knocked on doors throughout the city seeking support. Posters of his grinning mug were up on shop windows. You couldn't get on social media without seeing one of his well-produced videos pitching his vision \u2014 free buses, free childcare, new apartments, a higher minimum wage and more, paid for by new taxes on the rich. He would be the city's first Indian-American and first Muslim mayor.",
      "Cuomo and some other Democrats have cast Mamdani as unqualified. They say he doesn't have the management chops to wrangle the city's sprawling bureaucracy or handle crises. Critics have also taken aim at Mamdani's support for Palestinian human rights.",
      "In response, Mamdani has slammed Cuomo over his sexual harassment scandal and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "In one heated debate exchange, Cuomo rattled off a long list of what he saw as Mamdani's managerial shortcomings, arguing that his opponent, who has been in the state Assembly since 2021, has never dealt with Congress or unions and never overseen an infrastructure project. He added that Mamdani couldn't be relied upon to go toe-to-toe with Trump.",
      "Mamdani had a counter ready.",
      "\u201cTo Mr. Cuomo, I have never had to resign in disgrace,\" he said.",
      "Cuomo r esigned in 2021 after a report commissioned by the state attorney general concluded that he had sexually harassed at least 11 women. He has always maintained that he didn't intentionally harass the women, saying he had simply fallen behind what was considered appropriate workplace conduct.",
      "During the campaign, he has become more aggressive in defending himself, framing the situation as a political hit job orchestrated by his enemies.",
      "The fresh scandal at City Hall involving Mayor Eric Adams, though, gave Cuomo a path to end his exile.",

      "Eleven dogs died while in the care of a California dog trainer and prosecutors say he and his girlfriend tried to destroy the evidence by dropping off the dogs' bodies at different crematoriums.",
      "Kwong (Tony) Chun Sit, of Irvine, pleaded not guilty Monday in Orange County Superior Court to 11 counts of animal cruelty, 11 counts of animal abuse by a caretaker, seven counts of attempting to destroy evidence and one count of destruction of evidence, according to the Orange County District Attorney's Office.",
      "Tingfeng Liu, of Vista, who is dating Sit, pleaded not guilty Monday to accessory to a felony and destruction of evidence, police said.",
      "Sit, 53, and Liu, 23, are both are in custody on $550,000 bail each. Prosecutors said the couple was packed and ready to flee when they were arrested on Thursday. Each has been assigned a public defender, prosecutors said.",
      "A pet owner contacted police last week saying their dog trainer told them their dog had died and had been cremated, police spokesperson Kyle Oldoerp said.",
      "Investigators since have determined that 11 dogs died and that nine of them died on or around Wednesday, police said.",
      "Aimee Gutierrez said in a social media post that her family several weeks earlier had adopted a 9-month-old Belgian Malinois and named her Saint. She said the person they trusted to help train Saint informed her by text that Saint had died in her sleep.",
      "\u201cWe were not given details,\u201d Gutierrez said. We were not given the change to say goodbye. We later learned that she had been cremated without our consent or knowledge.\"",
      "Another dog was also cremated, police said. The Irvine Police Department\u2019s Animal Services Unit recovered the bodies of multiple dogs that prosecutors say had been dropped off by either Sit or Liu at crematoriums.",
      "Necropsies performed on three of the dogs show two of the dogs died from heat stroke and the third dog died from blunt force trauma, prosecutors said. Necropsies are pending on the remaining six animals.",
      "All but one of the dogs was dropped off at crematoriums last Wednesday. The body of the first dog was dropped off on June 13.",
      "Sit worked throughout Southern California under different company names, including Happy K9 Academy, police said. A website with that company name lists Tony Sit as the author of its blog posts. It says their services include boarding and training but doesn't give a boarding facility address or other specific information. An address listed on the website is that of a public park in Tustin, California.",
      "The police investigation is ongoing, Oldoerp said.",

      "McALLEN, Texas -- Immigration arrests seen on video are showing an emerging trend: More Border Patrol agents are doing their jobs far from the borders with Mexico or Canada.",
      "A Border Patrol agent was seen hitting a Southern California landscaper on the head and neck as he was pinned to the ground during an arrest Saturday. The Department of Homeland Security said the man swung his weed trimmer at agents. The man\u2019s son, Alejandro Barranco, a Marine veteran, said his father was scared but did not attack anyone.",
      "With border arrests at the lowest levels in about 60 years, the roughly 20,000 Border Patrol agents are showing up elsewhere.",
      "Here are things to know about the trend:",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s House-approved \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d proposes $8 billion to increase U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement staff by 10,000 people. Until then, the agency primarily responsible for interior enforcement is relying on other federal agencies as it struggles to meet a daily arrest target of at least 3,000 set by Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and chief architect of immigration policy.",
      "ICE, with only about 6,000 deportation officers, has found a ready partner in the Border Patrol, which is also part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It comes at a time when border arrests plunged to an average of 282 a day in May after peaking at more than 8,000 a day in December 2023.",
      "Agents in the Border Patrol\u2019s Yuma, Arizona, sector assisted ICE officers last week in Philadelphia, Justin De La Torre, the sector chief, said in a social media post. His sector averaged only four arrests a day on the Arizona border last month after peaking at more than 1,100 a day in May 2023.",
      "Greg Bovino, chief of the Border Patrol\u2019s El Centro, California, sector, appeared alongside U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at a news conference this month in Los Angeles during which U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcefully removed, pushed to the ground and handcuffed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here and not going away,\u201d Bovino said, introducing himself to reporters as his agency\u2019s top representative during ICE-led operations in Los Angeles.",
      "Few see any reason to doubt the Border Patrol will remain.",
      "\u201cSo long as the border remains relatively quiet, we will continue to see the Border Patrol deployed to act almost as if they are ICE agents,\u201d said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, an advocacy group.",
      "Agents are granted by federal law the ability to stop and question people within 100 miles (161 kilometers) of the border, including the coasts. They have heightened authority to board and search buses, trains and vessels without a warrant within the zone.",
      "That encompasses vast swaths of the country that include about two-thirds of the U.S. population, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Los Angeles is well within 100 miles of the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Beyond that zone, agents are still authorized to work within the United States.",
      "\"The Border Patrol can still operate fully in the interior. It\u2019s just that they have less authority to stop and question people,\u201d said Reichlin-Melnick.",
      "Past the 100-mile enforcement zone, Border Patrol agents, like officers working for ICE or the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Field Operations, are classified as immigration officers who are authorized to carry out arrests and detain people on suspicion of violating immigration law. There are some limits.",
      "\u201cThey could only search somebody's car on probable cause that the person has violated the law,\" Reichlin-Melnick said. \u201cAnd so people have somewhat heightened rights against search and seizure outside of the 100-mile zone than they do inside of the 100-mile zone. But each individual case will vary depending on the specific circumstances.\"",

      "The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.",
      "The roadless rule adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "The rule impeded road construction and \u201cresponsible timber production\u201d that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.",
      "\u201cThis move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation\u2019s forests,\" Rollins said.",
      "Scientists say that worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has allowed fuels to build up.",
      "The roadless rule has affected 30% of national forest lands nationwide, or about 59 million acres (24 million hectares), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency over the Forest Service.",
      "State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.",
      "Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab.",
      "Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands.",
      "Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new \u201cera of abundance\u201d on public lands under President Donald Trump's administration in the development of natural resources including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.",
      "Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting \u201cnot for sale\" and carrying signs that read, \u201cThis land belongs to you and me\u201d and \u201ckeep our public land free for future generations.\u201d",
      "On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas \u201canother example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.\u201d",
      "The roadless area change meanwhile marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which far from opening up more areas to timber harvesting sought to do more to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests.",
      "Environmental groups, who want to keep restrictions on logging and road-building for places such as Alaska's Tongass National Forest, criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections.",
      "\u201cAny attempt to revoke it is an attack on the air and water we breathe and drink, abundant recreational opportunities which millions of people enjoy each year, havens for wildlife and critical buffers for communities threatened by increasingly severe wildfire seasons,\u201d Josh Hicks, conservation campaigns director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement on the USDA\u2019s plans.",
      "Contrary to what Rollins said about reducing wildfire risk, logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense, said Center for Western Priorities political director Rachael Hamby.",
      "\u201cThis is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us,\u201d Hamby said in a statement.",
      "In Alaska, home to the country's largest national forest, the Tongass, the roadless rule has long been a focus of litigation, with state political leaders supporting an exemption to the rule that they argue impedes economic opportunities.",
      "During the latter part of Trump\u2019s first term, the federal government lifted restrictions on logging and road-building in the Tongass, something the Biden administration later reversed.",
      "Trump in January called for reverting to the policy from his first term as part of an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas development, mining and logging in the state.",
      "The Tongass is a temperate rainforest of glaciers and rugged coastal islands. It provides habitat to wildlife such as bears, wolves, salmon and bald eagles.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans have hit a roadblock in an effort that could deter nonprofits, individuals and other potential litigants from filing lawsuits to block President Donald Trump over his executive actions.",
      "As Trump faces lawsuits nationwide, GOP lawmakers had sought to bar federal courts from issuing temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions against the federal government unless the plaintiffs post what in many cases would be a massive financial bond at the beginning of the case.",
      "The proposal was included in the Senate version of Trump's massive tax and immigration bill, but ran into trouble with the Senate parliamentarian, who said it violates the chamber's rules. It is now unlikely to be in the final package.",
      "Federal judges can already require plaintiffs to post security bonds, but such funds are commonly waived in public interest cases. The GOP proposal would make the payment of the financial bond a requirement before a judge could make a ruling, which critics said would have a chilling effect on potential litigants who wouldn't have the resources to comply.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer hailed the parliamentarian's ruling in a press statement and called the GOP effort \u201cnothing short of an assault on the system of checks and balances that has anchored the nation since it's founding.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut Senate Democrats stopped them cold,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Lawmakers are running scores of provisions by the Senate parliamentarian\u2019s office to ensure they fit with the chamber's rules for inclusion in a reconciliation bill. The recommendations from Elizabeth MacDonough will have a major impact on the final version of the legislation.",
      "On Friday, she determined that a proposal to shift some food stamps costs from the federal government to states would violate the chamber\u2019s rules. But some of the most difficult questions are still to come as Republicans hope to get a bill passed and on Trump's desk to be signed into law before July 4th.",
      "Republicans could still seek to include the judiciary provision in the bill, but it would likely be challenged and subject to a separate vote in which the provision would need 60 votes to remain. The parliamentarian's advice, while not binding, is generally followed by the Senate.",
      "Republicans and the White House have been highly critical of some of the court rulings blocking various Trump orders on immigration, education and voting. The courts have agreed to block the president in a number of cases, and the administration is seeking appeals as well.",
      "In April, the House voted to limit the scope of injunctive relief ordered by a district judge to those parties before the court, rather than applying the relief nationally. But that bill is unlikely to advance in the Senate since it would need 60 votes to advance. That's left Republicans looking for other avenues to blunt the court orders.",

      "But the Democratic runoff might struggle to reach 1% turnout statewide. And counties could spend $10 million statewide to hold the election, based on a sampling of some county spending. That could be more than $100 per vote.",
      "People who want to change Georgia's runoff system say this election shows how the state spends money only to have decisions made by a fraction of people who voted the first time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible waste of resources,\" said state Rep. Saira Draper, an Atlanta Democrat.",
      "But key Republicans are opposed to two methods used elsewhere \u2014 letting someone win without a majority or using ranked choice voting to determine a majority. In the meantime, some Republican-dominated counties are using a state law to reduce the number of polling places for the runoff.",
      "In many states, finishing first is enough to win, even if it\u2019s far short of a majority. Georgia is one of only nine states, mostly in the South, that require runoffs. And it\u2019s one of only two states, along with Mississippi, that demand a runoff if no candidate wins a general election majority after a partisan primary.",
      "Historians say runoffs were created in part to make it harder for Black candidates to win office, giving white voters a chance to unify around a candidate.",
      "Georgia legislators in 1995 lowered the threshold to avoid a runoff, requiring a candidate to a earn only a 45% plurality. Republicans changed the threshold back to a majority after a GOP candidate lost a 1996 Senate race.",
      "Draper introduced a bill in 2023 to lower the threshold back to 45%, but it went nowhere. House Governmental Affairs Committee Chair Victor Anderson, a Cornelia Republican, is among many who believes a majority is an important electoral mandate.",
      "\u201cTo actually win an election you should receive, in one form or fashion, at least 50% plus one of the vote. And so I am not in favor of a plurality system,\" said Anderson, whose committee oversees election legislation.",
      "Another option would be letting voters rank their choices and determining the winner using second or third choices. That's the system New York City voters are using to elect a mayor.",
      "Scot Turner, a former Republican state representative who champions that system, said turnout is typically lower for runoffs, silencing voters who don't return. He said ranked choice voting would broaden participation, ensure a majority chooses the winner and save money.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tweak of our existing system that maximizes turnout and lowers cost,\u201d Turner said. \u201cBecause we see these massive drop-offs in turnout for runoffs, those are disenfranchised voters. Their votes are tossed as if they never were cast.\u201d",
      "Georgia issues ranked-choice ballots to military and overseas voters. But many Republicans oppose expansion, with the Georgia Senate passing bills to ban its further use.",
      "What some counties are doing is limiting the number of polling places for the runoff.",
      "State law allows a county to open only one polling place for a primary runoff if fewer than 1% of a county's registered voters cast ballots in the initial primary. That's likely to apply to some Republican-dominated counties. A few rural counties, including Miller County, already operate only one voting location.",
      "Cherokee County, with nearly 208,000 active voters, announced Friday that it would open only one polling place after fewer than 2,000 people cast ballots in the Democratic primary. Elections Director Anne Dover said the decision would cut the cost of the runoff in half, saving about $70,000.",
      "Travis Doss, president of the Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials, said Friday that as many as 20 counties are considering that option.",

      "A federal jury has awarded $500,000 to the widow and estate of a police officer who killed himself nine days after he helped defend the U.S. Capitol from a mob of rioters, including a man who scuffled with the officer during the attack",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal jury on Monday awarded $500,000 to the widow and estate of a police officer who killed himself nine days after he helped defend the U.S. Capitol from a mob of rioters, including a man who scuffled with the officer during the attack.",
      "The eight-member jury ordered that man, 69-year-old chiropractor David Walls-Kaufman, to pay $380,000 in punitive damages and $60,000 in compensatory damages to Erin Smith for assaulting her husband, Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith, inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. They awarded an additional $60,000 to compensate Jeffrey Smith's estate for his pain and suffering.",
      "The judge presiding over the civil trial dismissed Erin Smith\u2019s wrongful-death claim against Walls-Kaufman before jurors began deliberating last week. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said no reasonable juror could conclude that Walls-Kaufman\u2019s actions were capable of causing a traumatic brain injury leading to Smith\u2019s death.",
      "Walls-Kaufman, who lived a few blocks from the Capitol, denied assaulting Smith. He says any injuries that the officer suffered on Jan. 6 occurred later in the day, when another rioter threw a pole that struck Smith around his head.",
      "On Friday, the jury sided with Erin Smith and held Walls-Kaufman liable for assaulting her 35-year-old husband \u2014 an encounter captured on the officer's body camera.",
      "\u201cErin is grateful to receive some measure of justice,\u201d said David P. Weber, one of her attorneys.",
      "Walls-Kaufman said the outcome of the trial is \u201cabsolutely ridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo crime happened. I never struck the officer. I never intended to strike the officer,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm just stunned.\u201d",
      "After the jury left the courtroom, Reyes encouraged the parties to confer and discuss a possible settlement to avoid the time and expense of an appeal and for the sake of \u201cfinality.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou guys settle, you can move on with your lives,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Walls-Kaufman's attorney, Hughie Hunt, described the jury's award as \u201cshocking.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're talking about a three-second event,\u201d he told the judge.",
      "\u201cIt's not shocking, Mr. Hunt. A lot of things can happen in three seconds,\u201d Reyes replied.",
      "Jeffrey Smith was driving to work for the first time after the Capitol riot when he shot and killed himself with his service weapon. His family said he had no history of mental health problems before the Jan. 6 riot. Erin Smith claims Walls-Kaufman struck her husband in the head with his own police baton, giving him a concussion and causing psychological and physical trauma that led to his suicide.",
      "The police department medically evaluated Smith and cleared him to return to full duty before he killed himself. In 2022, the District of Columbia Police and Firefighters\u2019 Retirement and Relief Board determined that Smith was injured in the line of duty and the injury was the \u201csole and direct cause of his death,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "Walls-Kaufman served a 60-day prison sentence after pleading guilty to a Capitol riot-related misdemeanor in January 2023, but he was pardoned in January. On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump pardoned, commuted prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of cases for all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in the attack.",
      "More than 100 law-enforcement officers were injured during the riot. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick collapsed and died a day after engaging with the rioters. A medical examiner later determined he suffered a stroke and died of natural causes. Howard Liebengood, a Capitol police officer who responded to the riot, also died by suicide after the attack.",
      "Erin Smith's quest isn't over. She applied for the National Law Enforcement Memorial to add her husband's name as a line-of-duty death. Weber said they're hoping for a decision soon.",

      "A search continues for two people still missing after six others were killed when a boat capsized on Lake Tahoe in California during a powerful weekend thunderstorm that whipped up high waves",
      "SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. -- Divers searched a section of Lake Tahoe on Monday for two people still missing after six others were killed when a boat capsized during a powerful weekend thunderstorm that whipped up high waves, authorities said.",
      "Ten people were on board the 27-foot (8-meter) gold Chris-Craft vessel when it flipped Saturday afternoon near D.L. Bliss State Park on the lake\u2019s southwest edge, U.S. Coast Guard officials said.",
      "Two people were rescued immediately and taken to a hospital in unknown condition. Six bodies were recovered later Saturday, said Sgt. Kyle Parker with the El Dorado County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Their names won\u2019t be released until family members are notified, he said.",
      "The intensity of the thunderstorm surprised even forecasters, who had predicted some rain but nothing like the sudden squall that lashed the southern part of the lake around 3 p.m., said meteorologist Matthew Chyba with the National Weather Service office in Reno, Nevada. Winds topped 35 mph (56 kph) and waves swelled more than 8 feet (2.5 meters).",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting it to be so strong,\u201d Chyba said Monday. He said temperatures in the area were 15 to 25 degrees below normal for this time of year, which could have contributed to the unstable air mass.",
      "Eight-foot waves on Tahoe is \u201cpretty significant,\u201d Chyba said. \u201cThey were really rocking the lake.\u201d",
      "Lake Tahoe is a popular summer recreation destination for boaters, kayakers and paddleboarders. The pristine lake with very cold water straddles California and Nevada and is one of the deepest in the country, second only to Oregon's Crater Lake.",
      "Rescue crews and divers scoured the area Saturday evening for the remaining two victims and resumed efforts Sunday morning before the Coast Guard eventually called off its search. El Dorado County sheriff's deputies continued searching Monday with help from other agencies from California and neighboring Nevada, Parker said.",
      "The storm Saturday cleared out within about two hours.",
      "Chris Williams, a party boat operator with Tahoe Sports, was one of four company captains on the lake Saturday when the weather turned. He was stunned by the force of the storm and the size of the swells.",
      "\u201cWe braved the weather and came back during some severe wave heights that have never been seen on Lake Tahoe,\u201d Williams told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cWe were pushing the vessels to their maximum capabilities while making sure to keep all clients safely aboard.\u201d",
      "While all guests from Tahoe Sports charters returned safely, Williams said two boats from the company\u2019s Tahoe Keys location broke from the pier and washed ashore.",
      "Video obtained by KCRA-TV showed moored boats at a nearby marina crashing into one another amid strong gusts.",

      "Florida condominium residents grappling with the steep cost of building improvements will get some financial relief under a new bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday.",
      "The new measure gives condo homeowner associations more flexibility in how to build up their reserve funds and eases some requirements for safety assessments.",
      "Approval came the day before the fourth anniversary of the partial collapse of Champlain Towers South, which killed 98 people in Surfside in 2021. The new law goes into effect July 1 and is aimed at reforming a condo safety law passed in 2022 in the wake of that disaster.",
      "Speaking at Monday\u2019s bill signing in Clearwater, Republican state Sen. Ed Hooper said the 2022 law was meant to ensure there was never another collapse like Surfside. In retrospect, he said some of the requirements enacted were probably an overreaction, which lawmakers are now hoping to correct.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s time to make the change,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cElderly people are losing their condos because they could not afford to make the increase in their monthly HOA fees. That\u2019s just wrong.\u201d",
      "Condo owners in Florida faced rising costs under the 2022 law, which requires condo associations to have sufficient reserves to cover major repairs. In the aftermath of the Surfside disaster, some residents were caught off guard by hefty fees levied to cover years of deferred maintenance expenses required to bring their buildings into compliance with the 2022 legislation.",
      "The mounting costs to cover renovations and build up reserve funds have strained residents in the condo haven of South Florida, especially retirees and those living on fixed incomes.",
      "Condo owners along the state\u2019s southwest coast have taken the extra hit of last year\u2019s back-to-back hurricanes, which clobbered waterfront communities in the Tampa Bay area and forced additional renovations and repairs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a full-time job for me keeping track of this,\u201d condo owner Earle Cooper said of the repairs to his building in Belleair. \u201cHurricanes just multiply the problems.\u201d",
      "The new measure allows certain condo associations to fund their reserves through a loan or line of credit. It also gives residents greater flexibility to pause payments into their reserve funds while they prioritize needed repairs and extends the deadline for associations to complete structural integrity studies. Some smaller buildings will be exempt from having to do those analyses.",
      "\u201cI think that this will provide relief,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cBut to the extent that there needs to be some cleanup next year when the legislature reconvenes, we got to be willing to do that.\u201d ___ Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",

    "summary": "His mother is a member of the Kennedy clan; his father was the Terminator. Now, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger, a standout in the HBO Max series \"The White Lotus,\" talks about how he chose to pursue a career while carrying the weight of a famous Hollywood name.",
    "story": [
      "\"Every time I'm out in, like, nature, that's kind of where I like to do my prayers or gratitude list,\" said Patrick Schwarzenegger. These days he is counting his blessings, even though the role he was recently blessed with is anything but reverent. He plays the much-talked-about (and much-hated) Saxon Ratliff, the eldest son of a wealthy family visiting Thailand, in the latest incarnation of HBO's \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "Saxon is a chiseled car crash \u2013 a sex-obsessed, protein shake-chugging bro who is so irredeemably into his own masculinity, he offends even his own sister. How do you even audition for a part like that?",
      "Schwarzenegger says he was only given a short sentence describing Saxon's excitable personality: \"The wording was that ''He flirted with anything.' So, I just took the first few seconds and just kind of, you know, stared at the camera in a loving way.\"",
      "Did he have any reservations? \"Yes, I was worried,\" he said. \"I didn't want him to come off as just this one-note character.\"",
      "And early on he didn't even know yet just how sexually awkward things were going to get. \"When I was auditioning, they had said, 'Are you okay with, know, performing things sexually? Are you okay being nude at times?'\" Schwarzenegger recalled. \"So, I knew an idea of where it could go. I didn't know to what extent the show would go.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 3 of \"The White Lotus,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The series' creator, Mike White, has spent three seasons pushing the envelope, writing exotic whodunits that, along the way, skewer the rich and privileged vacationing at White Lotus resorts all around the world \u2013 a world he knew Patrick probably understood. Schwarzenegger said, \"There was a joke because he was always like, 'You don't look like you're rich. You're not walking rich. Aren't you a Schwarzenegger? Aren't you a Kennedy? Aren't you rich in real life? You don't look like you're rich at all!'\"",
      "The show's first season, set in Hawaii, debuted during the pandemic in 2021, and it hit Schwarzenegger and his family head-on. \"It was me, Abby, my fianc\u00e9e, and my mom,\" he said. \"We lived together, us three, during the pandemic. So, you can imagine how fun that was! And then they were always like, 'You need to be in the show, you need to audition, this is perfect.'\"",
      "His fianc\u00e9e is fashion model Abby Champion; his mom is journalist and member of the Kennedy clan Maria Shriver; and his dad, well, that goes without saying.",
      "Arnold Schwarzenegger has said that he didn't recognize his son in the role. \"It would be a little bit alarming if he did recognize a lot of those characteristics!\" Patrick laughed.",
      "His best friends are his family.  They're also his greatest fans.  When he got the part, they were tears all around. Patrick Schwarzenegger has emerged from \"The White Lotus,\" as a standout among standouts \u2013 the kind of breakout he hopes will put to rest any suspicions about nepotism.",
      "In a recent father-and-son chat on Variety's \"Actors on Actors,\"\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger said, \"To me, the name Schwarzenegger always meant a big plus.\"",
      "Patrick revealed that he worried his name might get in the way: \"There were times earlier in my career where I was wondering, Does it makes sense to go under some sort of alias? Does it make sense to go under a different name?\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad that you kept the name, 'cause now I can take credit,\" Arnold said. \"My son! The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\"",
      "Patrick idolized his dad growing up, spending time on movie sets that became his playground. By the time he was 13, he was on his own sets, but he says he rarely brought up his dad. \"I mean, I always know that there's, you know, my last name, there's connections, there's, you know, things that are gonna help me, but I wanted to try to take a different path than that.\"",
      "He did, however, follow his dad's path on matters of money \u2013 how to run a business, how to create a brand. \"My dad put me in charge of his memorabilia when I was 10,\" said Patrick. \"And so, I would take these different photos of him, you know, at Muscle Beach, and we would frame them. I took a replica of the Conan swords and get him to sign them, and I would sell them for $10,000 a pop. It was all for nonprofit. I didn't make any money, but it was to understand how to sell.\"",
      "He actually majored in business as USC, starting college just about a year after his parents had left the California Governor's office. Politics has been in his genes, after all \u2013 and so has the idea of public service. His grandfather, Sargent Shriver, was the founding director of the Peace Corps. His grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics.",
      "Asked if he's thought about going into politics himself, Patrick replied, \"I think it was instilled in us to find ways to give back at an early age. It doesn't have to be through public office, to find ways to give back.\"",
      "Through it all, his focus on acting remained pretty singular. He spent a decade in acting class, building a resume one part at a time, recently acting opposite Colin Firth in the HBO mini-series, \"The Staircase.\" That, he said, \"was the first time that the people in the industry were able to see me in a dramatic role. ... Before, people maybe didn't take me serious. They didn't know if I was really, you know, in it for the long haul, was I really working on my craft?\"",
      "WATCH: \"The White Lotus\" clip: Saxon and TimothyIn this scene, Saxon Ratliff (Patrick Schwarzenegger) demands to know from his dad, Timothy (Jason Isaacs)\u00a0 whether everything is OK at the office. [Spoiler alert: Everything is NOT OK at the office.]",
      "He hopes his next role will be a character with a few less character flaws than Saxon Ratliff. That said, Patrick Schwarzenegger would happily check back into the White Lotus anytime Mike White asks. \"I said, if you don't hire me again, I'll come and be the head of craft services,\" he said. \"I'll come and hire me as your scouting location guy because I just want to come in and be part of the journey.\"",

      "The barber shop's owner, Chad Oringer, an avid Doors fan, asked for a photo with Densmore and Krieger, the band's last surviving members.",
      "The Doors were fired by London Fog, but quickly got another gig just a few doors down Sunset, at the Whisky a Go Go. Playing there, said Krieger, was \"the biggest deal in town.\"",
      "\"It was Mecca,\" Densmore added.",
      "The room isn't much different from what it was back then. \"The stage is lower,\" Densmore said. People would dance in front of the stage. \"And they would just all be down there writhing around. Very inspirational!\" he laughed.",
      "He described the improvisational attitude of the band: \"Ray handed me a crumpled piece of paper and it said, 'Day destroys the night. Night divides the day. Try to run. Try to hide \u2026 Break on through.'\"",
      "Morrison had never sung lead before, and Densmore wasn't sure about him at first: \"He was so shy, it was ridiculous. And I thought, 'This is not the next Mick Jagger! But I love playing music, so I'll fool around here.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Why did you have confidence the band would work if he was so inexperienced as a singer?\"",
      "\"It was the words,\" Krieger said. \"They were so different than anything that was out there.\"",
      "\"Gifted,\" said Densmore. \"'Let's swim to the moon. Let's climb through the tide\u2026 ' A psychedelic love song. Wow!\"",
      "In 1967, Los Angeles DJ Dave Diamond began playing their records on his show, \"The Diamond Mine.\" Krieger said, \"And he would call us all the time and say, 'Hey, man. Every time I play 'Light My Fire,' people go nuts!'\"",
      "\"Light My Fire,\" written by Krieger, went to #1.",
      "But Morrison's troubles with alcohol and drugs were already apparent. Densmore said, \"At first I remember we talked about, 'Oh, he's an Irish drunk. He'll live forever. But deep down, maybe he's just a shooting star that'll be a quick impact.'\"",
      "\"You knew that right away?\" I asked.",
      "\"Kinda sensed it.\"",
      "\"Was that hard to accept?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" Densmore said. \"I mean, we miss his artistry like crazy. We don't miss his self-destruction.\"",
      "After Morrison's sudden death in Paris in 1971 at age 27, Densmore and Krieger didn't always agree with Manzarek about the band's legacy. \"At times, I felt he was selling The Doors too much. It's for the critics to do that,\" Densmore said.",

      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023.

      "Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background.",
      "Where and when is the wedding?",
      "Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location.",
      "The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019. Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019.",
      "The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore,\u00a0according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s.",
      "A protest group called \"No Space for Bezos\" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century\u00a0Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported.",
      "How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost?",
      "The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail.",
      "About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking.",
      "Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion)",
      "Who is attending?",
      "Bezos and Sanchez invited about 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests said to include\u00a0Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump.",
      "According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport.",
      "Who is Lauren Sanchez?",
      "Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023.",
      "Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight, which included \"CBS Mornings\" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the\u00a0idea for a female-led flight to Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021.",
      "Sanchez's bachelorette party in Paris last month included Perry, Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Eva Longoria, according to AFP.",
      "What are the wedding protests about?",
      "Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs.",
      "This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice\u00a0and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates.",
      "Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups.",
      "Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: \"IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX.\" Local police folded up the banner and took it away.",
      "Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated. In March, the city issued a statement denying reports that there would be any major disruption to daily Venetian life, even with hundreds expected to descend on the city this week for the wedding.",
      "Venice and the surrounding metropolitan area has a population of roughly 250,000, according to Statista. But fewer than 50,000 people live in the city's historic district, which is composed over 100 islands connected by Venice's famous canals and footbridges.",

    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his view that the central bank should keep interest rates steady for now, citing inflation risks from U.S. tariffs.",
      "Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony\u00a0Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump\u00a0to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December.",
      "In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation \"could be short lived\" or \"could instead be more persistent.\" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates.\u00a0But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said in the testimony.",
      "He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become \"an ongoing inflation problem.\"",
      "Powell is \"unbending under pressure,\" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. \"Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations.\"",
      "Fed officials push for cut",
      "Two Fed officials \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller \u2014 have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30.",
      "On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise.",
      "\"It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,\" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. \"Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting.\"",
      "Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize.",
      "\"The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,\" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, \"We will get to a place where we cut rates.\"",
      "At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows.",
      "\"Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note. \"The most likely next date for a cut is 9/17 or 10/29.\"",

To feel rich, over half said they would need annual income of at least $200,000, while 25% put the figure at $1 million, according to the personal finance firm.",
      "Bankrate researchers polled 2,260 adults across the U.S. for the survey which measures Americans' attitudes toward financial security. The upshot: Many people are increasingly unsure of whether they'll be able to get a leg up in today's economy. The share of Americans who describe themselves as not financially secure reached 77% this year, up from 75% in 2024 and 72% in 2023, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"Times have shifted,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster said in the analysis. \"Getting rich may have once been what many Americans fantasized about, but now simply living comfortably feels like the new aspiration, as economic challenges make financial stability a rare luxury.\"",
      "As of 2023 (the most recent data available), median U.S. income in the U.S. was just over $60,000 for a full-time worker, according to Census figures. If there's a silver lining, it's that average wage growth continues to surpass inflation, which has been on a downward trend since a pandemic-induced peak in 2022. The Consumer Price Index in May rose 2.4%, up just slightly from April's 2.3% rate.",
      "According to Bankrate's findings, Gen Xers (ages 45 to 60) were the most likely generation, at 84%, to say they're not where they want to be financially. Gen X also reported needing the highest income to feel financially comfortable, with 35% saying they need to make $150,000 or more.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration plans to rescind the \"roadless rule\" that impedes logging on 59 million acres of national forests, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.",
      "The \"roadless rule\" adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "The rule impeded road construction and \"responsible timber production\" that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.",
      "\"This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation's forests,\" Rollins said.",
      "Scientists say worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has enabled fuels to build up.",
      "The roadless rule has affected 30% of national forest lands nationwide, or about 59 million acres, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency over the Forest Service.",
      "State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.",
      "Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab.",
      "Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands.",
      "Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new \"era of abundance\" on public lands under President Trump's administration in the development of natural resources, including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.",
      "Immediate opposition appears",
      "Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting \"not for sale\" and carrying signs that read, \"This land belongs to you and me\" and \"keep our public land free for future generations.\"",
      "On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas \"another example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.\"",
      "The roadless area change meanwhile marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which far from opening up more areas to timber harvesting sought to do more to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests.",
      "Environmental groups, who want to keep restrictions on logging and road-building for places such as Alaska's Tongass National Forest, criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections.",
      "\"Any attempt to revoke it is an attack on the air and water we breathe and drink, abundant recreational opportunities which millions of people enjoy each year, havens for wildlife and critical buffers for communities threatened by increasingly severe wildfire seasons,\" Josh Hicks, conservation campaigns director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement on the USDA's plans.",
      "Contrary to what Rollins said about reducing wildfire risk, logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense, said Center for Western Priorities political director Rachael Hamby.",
      "\"This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us,\" Hamby said in a statement.",
      "In Alaska, home of the country's largest national forest, the Tongass, the roadless rule has long been a focus of litigation, with state political leaders supporting an exemption to the rule that they argue impedes economic opportunities.",
      "During the latter part of Mr. Trump's first term, the federal government lifted restrictions on logging and road-building in the Tongass, something the Biden administration later reversed.",
      "Mr. Trump in January called for reverting to the policy from his first term as part of an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas development, mining and logging in the state.",
      "The Tongass is a temperate rainforest of glaciers and rugged coastal islands. It provides habitat to wildlife such as bears, wolves, salmon and bald eagles.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oil-price-prices-iran-military-strike-crude-gasoline-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 06:46:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Global crude prices jumped on Sunday but have since retreated. Here's what experts say about the outlook for oil and gas.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on supplies of oil and gas, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices for Americans.",
      "The price of the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, jumped 4% on Sunday night shortly after the start of trading, but fell more than 7% on Monday afternoon. The decline came as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial waterway that the country partly controls and that is strategically vital for the flow of crude into global markets.",
      "Iran's parliament on Sunday approved cutting off the Strait, leaving the final decision to the country's national security council. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran announced by President Trump early Tuesday appeared to falter within a couple hours.",
      "The geopolitical crisis is sparking concerns that worsening hostilities could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would likely drive up gas and other energy costs, as well for other products refined from crude. Iran said Monday that it launched an attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.",
      "Iran, a major producer of crude, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by ships carrying roughly 20% of the world's daily supply of oil.",
      "\"In practice, Iranian efforts to 'close' the Strait could encompass a number of actions including attacking and detaining ships using the waterway, impeding navigability through the strait and, at the most extreme, laying mines in the sea,\" noted David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a report.",
      "But, he added, \"[S]o long as the conflict does not become a long-lasting war with no 'off ramp,' and disruption in the Strait remains limited to the lower-level actions seen up to now, we suspect that any initial spikes in global energy prices would dissipate before long.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Iran conflict's potential impact on oil and gas prices.",
      "What's the impact so far on oil prices?",
      "After surging in early trading on Monday, prices of Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 0.1% to $76.98 by midday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the U.S. benchmark, fell 3.8% to $71.06.",
      "Still, oil prices remain above their level before the hostilities between Israel and Iran began over a week ago, when a barrel of WTI crude was close to $68.",
      "Although Wall Street experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, they note that ongoing tensions in the region could disrupt the energy market and send prices soaring.",
      "\"Perhaps a bigger risk to the region's oil supply would be Israeli air strikes on Iran's oil production and export facilities, and/or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on oil production and export facilities in Iraq,\" Eurasia Group analysts said in a June 23 report.",
      "Israel so far has avoided targeting Iran's oil export industry. But if it were to do so, such strikes could disrupt the flow of several million barrels per day, sending Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel, according to the political risk consultancy.",
      "What would happen if the Strait of Hormuz is closed?",
      "Because the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, it's vulnerable to disruption. The channel connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.",
      "Although energy experts believe a closure of the Strait is unlikely, noting the adverse economic and geopolitical impact on Iran, they underline that a disruption to the flow of oil through the passage would send energy prices soaring.",
      "Interruptions to oil passing through the channel would severely impact markets in China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "The U.S. imports only about 7% of its oil through the Strait of Hormuz. But any interference with shipments passing through the area could impact the global oil market by stifling supplies, according to experts.",
      "\"[W]hile Iran has not yet targeted the route, even a limited disruption would severely impact global supply,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a June 20 client note. \"In a worst-case scenario, prices could spike to $130 per barrel and shave 0.8 percentage points off global GDP.\"",
      "The last time Brent crude topped $130 was in 2008, the result of a spike in energy demand and uncertainty in world energy supplies, according to the EIA. At the time, gasoline prices peaked at about $4.11 per gallon, or about $6.26 per gallon today after adjusting for inflation.",
      "What's the forecast for U.S. gas prices?",
      "American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon, GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan said.",
      "\"Most/all of the recent and expected rise is due to the Middle East tensions/situation,\" he said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even with that increase, U.S. drivers would still likely be paying less at the pump than they were a year ago. The average U.S. gas price now stands at $3.22 per gallon, down from $3.45 per gallon a year earlier, according to AAA.",

      "JetBlue Airways is ceasing service at Miami International Airport as the discount carrier moves to cut costs by eliminating less profitable routes.",
      "Miami International officials told CBS News Miami this weekend that the last JetBlue flight is scheduled for September 3.",
      "The airport is not a key hub for JetBlue. The airline operates only a single route into Miami International, offering one to two daily flights between the city and Boston's Logan International Airport, according to JetBlue spokesperson Derek Dombrowski. JetBlue serves over three dozen cities in the U.S., according to its route\u00a0map.",
      "For passengers heading to South Florida, JetBlue will continue to operate out of nearby Palm Beach International Airport and Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport. The latter, roughly 25 miles north of Miami, offered 70 daily flights to over 30 destinations as of April of this year.",
      "JetBlue will also suspend its year-round service between Boston and Seattle starting October 25, offering flights between the two cities solely during the summer season, according to Dombrowski.",
      "The shift in services align with changes outlined by JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty in an internal memo shared with CBS News last week. In it, Geraghty said the company would \"wind down underperforming routes\" as part of a larger effort to reduce costs amid softening demand for travel.",
      "\"We're hopeful demand and bookings will rebound, but even a recovery won't fully offset the ground we've lost this year, and our path back to profitability will take longer than we'd hoped,\" she said in the memo. \"That means we're still relying on borrowed cash to keep the airline running.\"",
      "The decision to terminate service at Miami International comes four years after JetBlue added the airport to its network. At its peak, the airline was operating as many as 14 daily flights to and from Miami International, according to the Miami Herald.",
      "JetBlue customers with flights booked to or from Miami after September 3 will be contacted and offered alternative travel options via Fort Lauderdale or a full refund, according to Dombrowski.",

      "Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies\u00a0said\u00a0they were entering a \"long-term collaboration\" to make obesity treatment more accessible.",
      "Shares of Hims & Hers plunged more than $20, or roughly 31%, to $44.10 following Novo Nordisk's announcement.",
      "Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales.",
      "Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using \"knock-off, compounded versions\" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug.",
      "This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices.",
      "\"After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,\" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration.\"",
      "The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF.",

    "story": [
      "Real estate giant Compass is suing Zillow, alleging that the online property website is violating antitrust laws with a new rule that bans home listings from its platform if they appear on any other service for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow.",
      "Zillow's rule, announced by the company in April, took effect on May 28, with the company saying that the new standard is necessary to ensure that listings are \"marketed to every buyer\" to give house-hunters \"fair access to listings without having to get access behind a velvet rope controlled by any one company.\"",
      "But Compass, which seeks to give some clients a competitive advantage by posting homes before they appear on Zillow and other sites, is alleging that what it calls the \"Zillow ban\" violates federal antitrust laws. The real estate company claims that ZIllow is leveraging its market dominance to impose the block on listings outside of its website, and that it is aimed at hobbling competition, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"This lawsuit is about protecting consumer choice,\" Compass CEO Robert Reffkin said in a statement. \"No one company should have the power to ban agents or listings simply because they don't follow that company's business model.\"",
      "He added, \"That's not competition. It's coercion. Imagine if Amazon banned a seller for offering a product on their own website first. That's what Zillow is doing in real estate. Consumers should have the right to choose how they sell their homes.\"",
      "Compass said it has hired Ken Dintzer, a partner in the antitrust division of law firm Crowell & Moring who led the U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Google, to represent it in the lawsuit.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a Zillow spokesperson said Compass' claims \"are unfounded\" and that it will fight the lawsuit.",
      "The spokesperson added, \"At the heart of this issue is a simple principle: When a listing is publicly marketed, it should be accessible to all buyers \u2014 across all platforms, including Zillow. Hiding listings creates a fragmented market, limits consumer choice and creates barriers to homeownership, which is bad for buyers, sellers and the industry at large, especially in this inventory and affordability-constrained environment.\"",
      "Private exclusives",
      "With the lawsuit, Compass is defending its three-pronged marketing strategy for home listings that it says can better serve sellers. The first step in the strategy is a \"private exclusive\" listing that is available on Compass' internal platform, which allows its agents to share information about the home with possible buyers.",
      "The second step involves a \"coming soon\" listing on Compass's website, available to anyone who searches online for properties. The third element involves moving the listing to multiple listing services, or MLS, and onto aggregation sites like Zillow.",
      "\"For Zillow, every home buyer search conducted on Compass instead of Zillow is a lost opportunity for Zillow to lock that prospective home buyer into Zillow's ecosystem and make money selling her information to real estate agents for a lead fee \u2014 Zillow's central business model,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The complaint alleges that \"Zillow doesn't like the 3-phased marketing strategy because Zillow can't make money selling leads off listings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 where they don't have the listings.\"",
      "Compass, which has more than 33,000 real estate agents, said that almost half of all sellers who signed with them relied on its three-step listing strategy in the first quarter.",

    "title": "Tesla to debut robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, today",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-robotaxi-launch-austin-texas-elon-musk-june-22/",
    "published": "Sun, 22 Jun 2025 12:49:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Tesla is giving a select group of people the chance to try out its robotaxis this weekend in Austin, Texas.",
    "story": [
      "After years of teasing a new line of self-driving vehicles, billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk is finally making good on his promise with the rollout of Tesla's robotaxi service.",
      "When is the robotaxi event?",
      "On June 22, Tesla will give a select group of people the chance to ride in its Model Y Robotaxis \u00a0in Austin, Texas, where the EV maker moved its headquarters from California in 2021.",
      "Tesla did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's email seeking information about the launch. However, details shared on social media and past comments from Musk offer some clues as to what it will look like.",
      "Where will the robotaxi event take place?",
      "The pilot will likely involve a small number of cars and rides will take place in a \"geofenced area\" in Austin. In a CNBC interview in\u00a0May, Musk suggested there could be around 10 robotaxis in circulation during the pilot in Austin, and said Tesla would scale up the number from there.",
      "According to a note from Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives, there could be up to 20 Model Y cars circling around Austin on Sunday.",
      "It's unclear how many people were invited to participate in the pilot, although it appears \"Early Access\" invites went primarily to Tesla investors and enthusiasts. In a copy of the\u00a0invitation\u00a0shared on social media, it says these riders will be \"among the first to use our new Robotaxi App\" and that they will be able to provide \"valuable feedback.\"",
      "Those invited to Austin's pilot can hail the self-driving cars via the Robotaxi App and go anywhere except the airport from 6 a.m. to midnight on Sunday, the invitation says.",
      "What has Elon Musk said about robotaxis?",
      "Musk previewed the launch in January during an earnings call, saying the cars will be \"in the wild with no one in them, in June in Austin.\" A\u00a0video posted by the company that same month offers a glimpse of the interiors and exteriors of Tesla's autonomous vehicles.",
      "The robotaxi event comes just weeks after Musk stepped back from the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration's cost-cutting effort. With Tesla's sales tumbling amid widespread protests against his government work, some Tesla investors had asked him\u00a0to refocus on the EV carmaker.",
      "In an X post from earlier this month, Musk\u00a0teased the June 22 launch date and said the first driverless trip \"from factory end of line all the way to a customer house\" is set to take place on June 28.",
      "From there, he has said he expects services to scale rapidly. It's likely that the Tesla robotaxi could be rolled out in 25 U.S. cities over the next year, according to Ives.",
      "Are there safety concerns about robotaxis?",
      "Autonomous vehicles have drawn scrutiny from the government officials and independent groups like the Dawn Project, a computer safety advocacy company, which argues that Tesla's self-driving technology puts children in harm's way.",
      "Tesla is also under the microscope of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which\u00a0launched an investigation in October\u00a0after four vehicles with Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" system were involved in crashes.",
      "In May, the agency's investigatory arm shifted its focus to the impending pilot program in Austin, saying in a\u00a0letter\u00a0that it wants information from Tesla on how it plans to evaluate its fleet of robotaxis for use on public roads.",
      "These concerns seems to have caught the attention of Musk, who earlier this month wrote, \"We are being super paranoid about safety\" in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0discussing the rollout.",
      "On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers from Texas signed a letter asking Tesla to delay its launch until September 1, when a new law regulating the safety of autonomous vehicles takes effect. Under the laws new framework, commercial vehicles would be required to get authorization for the Department of Motor Vehicles \"before operating on public streets without a human driver.\"",
      "It's unlikely that will hobble this weekend's launch, which appears to be moving ahead, albeit with certain safety provisions built in. According to the invite\u00a0shared on social media, the robotaxis in Austin pilot will have a \"Tesla Safety Monitor\" in the front right passenger seat. Remote monitors will also be keeping track of the rides, according to\u00a0CNBC.",
      "How important are robotaxis for Tesla?",
      "The rollout of the robotaxi service, if successful, could help boost the company's fortunes after it faced intense backlash over Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's DOGE, noted Wedbush's Ives.",
      "Tesla's first-quarter results fell short of expectations, with its profit tumbling 71% and its sales sliding 9% during the three-month period. While its stock has regained some lost ground since Musk said he would return his focus to Tesla, it's still 33% below its December peak of about $480 per share.",
      "The robotaxi rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, or double its current valuation, according to Ives.",
      "\"The golden era of autonomous for Tesla officially kicks off on Sunday in Austin,\" Ives wrote in a research report. \"We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla.\"",
      "In ramping up robotaxi service, Tesla is hoping to slingshot past Waymo, another autonomous car service that operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, according to its\u00a0website. Last week, Waymo\u00a0applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City.",
      "\"I don't really think about competitors. I just think about making the product as perfect as possible,\" Musk has said of his robotaxi venture.",
      "Either way, Tesla will have some catching up to do. Waymo currently gets 250,000 paid trips each week for its driverless taxis service.",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

But buyers are actually paying far less than sellers' median asking price, which stood at $422,238 for the same period, the real estate company's data shows.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:50:16 -0400",
    "summary": "This was the number one airline in the U.S. last year, based on its reliability, passenger experience and more.",
    "story": [
      "Looking to travel this summer but not sure which airline to fly for the best experience? The Points Guy (TPG), an online site dedicated to improving consumers' travel experiences while helping them save money, has revealed its annual ranking of the best airlines in the U.S.",
      "Founder and CEO Brian Kelly said the site ranks airlines based on four criteria: a carrier's reliability and performance; passenger experience; its cost and reach; and the quality of its loyalty or rewards program. Recent carrier meltdowns have travelers thinking more carefully about which airline \u2014 and through which airports \u2014 they want to fly.",
      "\"This is not just my personal decision,\" Kelly told CBS Mornings. He also explained how the company weighs each metric. \"We have a formula. We use lots of data. This isn't us just sticking our finger up in the air and kind of playing favorites. We look at reliability, first and foremost.\"",
      "\"When you buy airfare, you need to get to where you're going, so we give a huge amount \u2014 30% \u2014 to reliability,\" Kelly explained.",
      "Some airlines are going the extra mile to make flying more enjoyable for customers, from the minute they step foot in an airport through touchdown. For that reason, TPG assigned a 25% weight to an airline passenger's experience score to determine its overall ranking.",
      "An airline's cost and reach \u2014 including how expansive its network of destinations is \u2014 was assigned a 20% weight. And one-quarter of an airline's score was determined by the quality of its loyalty of rewards program.",
      "How the airlines stack up",
      "Delta Air Lines topped the list for the seventh year in a row, with its relative strength across all categories earning it the highest ranking, according to TPG. It is the most reliable on-time airline in America. It also provides passengers with free wi-fi, a wide selection of inflight entertainment options and meals from Shake Shack.",
      "United came in second place, rising from third place last year, aided by an improved onboard experience. It could continue to climb the rankings next year after announcing a partnership with JetBlue that will expand the airline's reach and improve perks for its loyalty members, TPG said.",
      "Weighing on the airline, though, is United's outsized presence at Newark Airport, which is suffering from persistent equipment and staffing issues.",
      "Southwest Airlines moved up two spots to earn the No. 3 position. Working in the airline's favor is its low flight cancellation rate, which is the best of any of its competitors. While it scored points in the cost and reach category, recent changes in fee structures could end its reign. It recently ended its popular \"bags fly free\" policy and offers a new, basic economy fare.",

    "summary": "Unauthorized immigrants make up nearly 5% of the U.S. workforce, according to 2022 estimates, and a higher share in construction and agriculture.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration resumed more aggressive workplace immigration enforcement earlier this week after briefly pausing arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants last week.",
      "\"The message is clear now that we're going to continue doing worksite enforcement operations, even on farms and hotels, but based on a prioritized basis,\" President Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, said Thursday, adding, \"Criminals come first.\"",
      "The White House argues that undocumented workers drive down wages and take jobs from American-born workers. But some farming and hospitality industry leaders have warned the administration that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations, as many of these workers fill essential jobs that are difficult to replace with domestic labor.",
      "Undocumented immigrants make up a sizable slice of the workforce in not only hospitality and farming but also construction and manufacturing.",
      "Additionally, undocumented workers are spread across the U.S., including in blue states like California and New Jersey, and in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, like Texas, Florida, and Nevada, which have some of the biggest shares of unauthorized workers.",
      "Here's a closer look at the industries most dependent on undocumented workers and the states where these workers are concentrated.",
      "Undocumented workers in key industries",
      "The Center for Immigration Studies estimated in 2024 that there are about 14 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.",
      "The most recent detailed breakdown by sector and state comes from the Pew Research Center's analysis of Census data from 2022. According to that study, there were an estimated 8.3 million undocumented immigrants who were part of the workforce, out of 11 million total in the country at that time.",
      "These workers made up 4.8% of the overall U.S. workforce, according to Pew, but they were a much larger share of the workforce in several essential industries.",
      "Nearly 1 in 5\u00a0 household workers and landscapers, 16% of crop workers and meat processors, 14% of apparel manufacturing workers and 13% of construction workers were undocumented immigrants, Pew estimated.",
      "The numbers were even higher depending on the occupation. One-third of roofers and workers who install drywall and ceiling tiles were undocumented, as were a quarter of maids and housekeepers, and nearly one-fifth of brickmasons.",
      "Because the U.S. Census does not directly ask about legal status, the number of unauthorized immigrants and their participation in the workforce is inexact. Pew Research Center analyzed the American Community Survey from 2022, and Goldman Sachs produced similar estimates based on the 2023 version of the survey.",
      "The share of undocumented workers in a given industry may be even higher than estimates based on the Census. A survey by the Department of Agriculture from 2021 to 2022 found that 42% of 2,600 crop workers interviewed did not have work authorization.",
      "Industry leaders have said the renewed deportation push is making it harder to operate. American Farm Bureau Federation president Zippy Duvall expressed disappointment on Tuesday in the administration's decision to restart immigration arrests on farms, forecasting that it could lead to inflated food prices for American consumers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, domestic workers do not apply for farm jobs, despite aggressive hiring efforts. Without farm workers, vegetables will be left in the fields, fruit will remain unpicked, and cows will go unmilked. The end result is a reduced food supply and higher grocery prices for all of America's families,\" Duvall said in a statement.",
      "Research also indicates that deportation can actually lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers. One study of the Obama administration's Secure Communities program, which deported nearly half a million undocumented immigrants, estimated that for every 1 million people deported, the number of jobs held by U.S.-born people would be reduced by 88,000.",
      "\"You can think about foreign-born workers taking jobs like a construction worker or a dishwasher at a local restaurant, and then once people are in those jobs employers are also able to hire construction managers and waiters and waitresses. And those are jobs typically taken by U.S.-born workers,\" economist Chloe East, the study's author, told CBS News.",
      "Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, estimate that if all of the unauthorized workers in the country were deported, U.S. GDP could fall as much as 7.4% below baseline by 2028.",
      "Share of undocumented workers by state",
      "President Trump said in a recent post on social media that his administration would focus on deportation efforts in Democrat-led cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, which he characterized as the places where \"millions upon millions of illegal aliens reside.\"",
      "But research indicates the undocumented population is spread across the country in both blue- and red-leaning states.",
      "Unauthorized immigrants make up the greatest share of both the population and workforce in Nevada and Texas \u2014 two states Mr. Trump won in 2024 \u2014 where the Pew Research Center estimates over 8% of workers were undocumented as of 2022.",
      "In California, where immigration enforcement raids sparked protests last week, Pew estimated that as of 2022, 7.2% of the workforce was undocumented. In New York, the figure was about 5%.",
      "Texas Restaurant Association CEO and president Emily Williams Knight told CBS News that some restaurants in the state are experiencing staffing issues because workers are afraid to come to work amid the crackdown.",
      "\"You have to remember, if people stop going to work in restaurants, that means restaurants can't serve their community. That means the dollar that restaurants put into each community, for a dollar spent, goes away, and then those workers are also not spending,\" Knight said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"While the President remains focused on immediately removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from the country, including those given safe harbor in Democrat-run sanctuary cities, anyone who is here illegally is liable to be deported.\"",
      "Jackson added, \"Any suggestion that enforcing immigration law will hurt the workforce misses the forest for the trees \u2014 there is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force.\"",

    "summary": "ICE officers detained the wife of a Marine Corps veteran in Louisiana during a routine immigration appointment.",
    "story": [
      "After U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre's wife last month, he doesn't know how to tell his children where their mother went.",
      "When his nearly 2-year-old son Noah asks for his mother before bed, Clouatre just tells him, \"Mama will be back soon.\" When his 3-month-old, breastfeeding daughter Lyn is hungry, he gives her a bottle of baby formula instead. He's worried how his newborn will bond with her mother absent skin-to-skin contact.",
      "His wife, Paola, is one of tens of thousands of people in custody and facing deportation as the Trump administration pushes for immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day. Earlier this month, arrests by ICE during President Trump's second term topped 100,000, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"They knew I was veteran, they just ripped her away from me and her children, from her breastfeeding, you know, newborn daughter, it's almost inhumane,\" Adrian Clouatre told CBS News.",
      "Even as Marine Corps recruiters promote enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status, directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families, immigration law experts say. The federal agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation, government memos show.",
      "To visit his wife, Adrian Clouatre has to make an eight-hour round trip from their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to a rural ICE detention center in Monroe. Clouatre, who qualifies as a service-disabled veteran, goes every chance he can get.",
      "Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old Mexican national whose mother brought her into the country seeking asylum more than a decade ago, met Adrian Clouatre, 26, at a Southern California nightclub during the final months of his five years of military service in 2022. Within a year, they had tattooed each other's names on their arms.",
      "After they married in 2024, Paola Clouatre sought a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. Adrian Clouatre said he is \"not a very political person\" but believes his wife deserved to live legally in the U.S.",
      "\"I'm all for 'get the criminals out of the country,' right?\" he said. \"But the people that are here working hard, especially the ones married to Americans \u2014 I mean, that's always been a way to secure a green card.\"",
      "Detained at a green card meeting",
      "The process to apply for Paola Clouatre's green card went smoothly at first, but eventually she learned ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing.",
      "Clouatre and her mother had been estranged for years \u2014 Clouatre cycled out of homeless shelters as a teenager \u2014 and up until a couple of months ago, Clouatre had \"no idea\" about her mother's missed hearing or the deportation order, her husband said.",
      "Adrian Clouatre recalled that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer asked about the deportation order during a May 27 appointment as part of her green card application. After Paola Clouatre explained that she was trying to reopen her case, the staffer asked her and her husband to wait in the lobby for paperwork regarding a follow-up appointment, which her husband said he believed was a \"ploy.\"",
      "Soon, officers arrived and handcuffed Paola Clouatre, who handed her wedding ring to her husband for safekeeping.",
      "Adrian Clouatre, eyes welling with tears, said he and his wife had tried to \"do the right thing\" and that he felt ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests, though he understood they were trying to do their jobs.",
      "\"It's just a hell of a way to treat a veteran,\" said Carey Holliday, a former immigration judge who is now representing the couple. \"You take their wives and send them back to Mexico?\"",
      "The Clouatres filed a motion for a California-based immigration judge to reopen the case on Paola's deportation order and are waiting to hear back, Holliday said.",
      "On June 9, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services posted to social media about Paola Clouatre's case, writing that when Clouatre \"was apprehended by @CBP and ordered removed by a judge in 2018, she chose to defy the order and stay in the U.S. 7 years later, she had another bad idea and applied for a Green Card. @ICEgov took her into custody at our New Orleans office. @DHSgov has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "However, Paola Clouatre told CBS News of the 2018 order: \"My wife was not only a minor, but homeless when that removal order was issued. Her mom skipped the appointment, my wife was living in a homeless shelter in CPS care. And there was no way for her to know about the removal order.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre also shared with CBS News Tuesday a letter he said he wrote to Mr. Trump and submitted through WhiteHouse.gov.",
      "\"I'm aware that purely by law my wife is considered an illegal immigrant,\" he wrote in the letter. \"But she is being made to pay for the sins of her mother and has been inhumanly torn from her 2 young American children and American Veteran husband. We are married and have gone through the proper channels. We found out about her removal order about a week before we went to the USCIS interview and were honest about it hoping to have time to resolve the issue.\"",
      "Jeff Migliozzi, spokesperson for the Washington, D.C.-based migrant advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants, told CBS News in a statement: \"The scheduled ICE check-in arrest, like what happened here, has been a popular tactic under this administration in order to achieve higher numbers. The practice really underscores the cruelty and injustice of this administration's immigration policy -- here you have people doing all they can to follow the rules you gave them, and then you pull the rug out from under them. The result is separated families and shattered lives. It's appalling.\"",
      "Less discretion for military families",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Paola Clouatre \"is in the country illegally\" and that the administration is \"not going to ignore the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Ignoring an Immigration Judge's order to leave the U.S. is a bad idea,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a June 9 post on social platform X which appeared to refer to Clouatre's case. The agency added that the government \"has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre said the agency's X post does not accurately reflect his wife's situation because she entered the country as a minor with her mother, seeking asylum.",
      "\"She was not aware of the removal order, so she was not knowingly defying it,\" he said. \"If she had been arrested, she would have been deported long ago, and we would never have met.\"",
      "Prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member, said Holliday and Margaret Stock, a military immigration law expert.",
      "In a Feb. 28 memo, the agency said it \"will no longer exempt\" from deportation people in groups that had received more grace in the past. This includes the families of military personnel or veterans, Stock said. As of June 12, the agency said it has referred upward of 26,000 cases to ICE for deportation.",
      "USCIS still offers a program allowing family members of military personnel who illegally entered the U.S. to remain in the country as they apply for a green card. But there no longer appears to be room for leeway, such as giving a veteran's spouse like Paola Clouatre the opportunity to halt her active deportation order without facing arrest, Stock said.",
      "But numerous Marine Corps recruiters have continued to post ads on social media, geared toward Latinos, promoting enlistment as a way to gain \"protection from deportation\" for family members.",
      "\"I think it's bad for them to be advertising that people are going to get immigration benefits when it appears that the administration is no longer offering these immigration benefits,\" Stock said. \"It sends the wrong message to the recruits.\"",
      "Marine Corps spokesperson Master Sgt. Tyler Hlavac told The Associated Press that recruiters have now been informed they are \"not the proper authority\" to \"imply that the Marine Corps can secure immigration relief for applicants or their families.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 20:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump says the U.S. Iran strikes \"obliterated\" key nuclear sites, but an early intel assessment says Iran could reconstitute some of its capabilities in months, sources said.",
    "story": [
      "An initial classified assessment found the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said.",
      "The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said.",
      "Officials familiar with the report cautioned that it was an early assessment that could change as more information becomes available about the sites. It was not immediately clear at what confidence level the judgments included in the report were made.",
      "A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday at a press availability.",
      "\"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said.",
      "President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that \"Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "The U.S. Air Force dropped several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure \u2014 which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain \u2014 is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said.",
      "The assessment provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume their work, ranging from a few months to less than a year, the source told CBS News. The source added that Trump administration officials were warned prior to the strike that this was a possible outcome.",
      "The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said.",
      "Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities \u2014 including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges \u2014 could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon.",
      "Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN.",
      "The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment \"flat-out wrong\" and said it was leaked \"by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.\"",
      "\"The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,\" Leavitt said. \"Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\"",
      "The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear capabilities.",
      "\"The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,\" Hegseth said in a statement.",
      "A classified briefing for Congress on the administration's actions in Iran that had been scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled. Senate lawmakers are instead to be briefed by top intelligence and military officials on Thursday, one congressional aide familiar with the plan told CBS News. A similar briefing for the House will be held on Friday, according to House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation \u2014 carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles \u2014 added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks. A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding.",
      "The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon.",
      "American intelligence agencies have assessed Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. On the same day that Mr. Trump authorized strikes Saturday, one U.S. agency assessed that Iran could make a nuclear weapon in as little as three to eight months, but there was no indication that the country's Supreme Leader had authorized an effort to do so, CBS News has reported. Other U.S. intelligence agencies have said Iran would need a minimum of six to eighteen months to create a weapon they could deliver with success.",
      "But Israel has alleged Iran is \"racing towards a nuclear bomb,\" and Mr. Trump said last week he believed Iran was \"very close to having one.\" Iran has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is holding around 59,000 detainees in facilities across the country, likely setting a record high as the Trump administration aggressively expands nationwide immigration arrests, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "On Monday, June 23, ICE's detention level was \u2014 on paper at least \u2014 at over 140% capacity, since Congress last allocated 41,500 detainee beds for the agency, the figures show.",
      "The federal statistics show nearly half \u2014 or 47% \u2014 of those currently detained by ICE lack a criminal record and fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes, a sign of the widening scope of President Trump's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to expel dangerous criminal migrants, though top officials in his administration have said no one in the U.S. illegally will be immune from deportation.",
      "ICE can detain immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally \u2014 as well as foreigners whose legal status is under review for potential revocation, including in cases involving criminal offenses \u2014 while the agency attempts to deport them.",
      "As the agency spearheading federal efforts to carry out Mr. Trump's promised mass deportation campaign, ICE has garnered national headlines in recent weeks, as its operations have become more visible, expansive and, in the eyes of critics, aggressive. High-profile ICE operations at workplaces and other locations in the Los Angeles area earlier this month triggered large-scale protests, including some instances of violence, which Mr. Trump cited to activate National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to protect federal property and officers.",
      "Internal agency figures show ICE has averaged around 1,200 daily arrests so far in June, with arrests surpassing 2,000 on two days. That's nearly double the 660 daily arrest average during the first 100 days of President Trump's second administration, but it's still far below the 3,000 arrests top White House adviser Stephen Miller has said ICE should conduct every day.",
      "The 59,000 detainee population tops the previous peak in 2019, when the first Trump administration held as many as 55,000 immigrants in ICE detention, according to agency data compiled by researchers at Syracuse University. Historical data gathered by the Marshall Project suggests the 59,000 figure is the highest in the history of U.S. immigration detention. Two former senior ICE officials said they had never seen the agency holding that many detainees.",
      "\"If ICE is holding 59,000 immigrants in civil detention across the country, it would be the highest number on record that I'm aware of,\" said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies the U.S. immigration system.",
      "The current detention level is a 50% increase from the last days of the Biden administration, when ICE was holding around 39,000 detainees. Figures show it has mainly been driven by ICE arrests in the interior of the country, as opposed to transfers of migrants who just crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings have dropped to historic lows.",
      "Over 70% of the detainees in ICE custody were arrested in the U.S. interior, the government figures show, up from fewer than 40% when the Biden administration left office.",
      "ICE has been able to increase its arrest rate through various means, including through large-scale operations in locations across the U.S. supported by Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal law enforcement agencies. In addition, many of those arrested by ICE are inmates picked up at local and state jails as part of a longstanding program targeting noncitizens with criminal records.",
      "But the Trump administration has also vastly expanded who is subject to being detained by ICE, reversing limits placed by previous administration that largely required the agency to focus on arresting serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals. The administration also lifted a Biden-era pause on immigration roundups at worksites, launching arrest operations at a meat processing plant in Nebraska and a horse racetrack in Louisiana.",
      "It's unclear how the Trump administration has expanded ICE's detention capacity beyond the beds funded by Congress.",
      "Officials have been looking into converting some military bases, like Fort Bliss in Texas, into temporary immigration holding centers, though those plans have not fully materialized. The administration has also asked Congress for billions of dollars in extra funds for ICE, including to expand detention levels by tens of thousands of beds.",
      "Recently, Florida state officials offered to build several immigration detention sites to support the Trump administration, including one in the Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0Florida would receive federal funds\u00a0to set up those facilities.",
      "Representatives for DHS and ICE did not respond to questions about whether some detention facilities are over capacity.",
      "In a statement, ICE said its effort to target a \"massive backlog of illegal criminal aliens and public safety threats from the United States\" has led to \"a significant number of arrests, requiring greater detention capacity.\"",
      "\"ICE is implementing various options to meet its current and future detention needs, but more space for apprehended illegal aliens is needed as they await deportation,\" ICE added, noting the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" backed by the president would fund 100,000 detention beds.",
      "Kocher, the Syracuse University professor, said he's worried about conditions in ICE detention deteriorating amid the rapid expansion in the detainee population.",
      "\"I am concerned about ICE's ability to comply with the basic standards of civil detention or provide appropriate due process to immigrants \u2014 both of which the administration has so far treated as optional rather than required by law,\" Kocher said.",

      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified Tuesday in front of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce over the department's 2026 budget \u2014 and lawmakers grilled him on an array of topics, from federal funding cuts to vaccines.",
      "During their five minutes of questioning each, several Democratic representatives called out the secretary for what they said are a lack of transparency and a lack of science in decision-making.",
      "They also criticized proposed health funding cuts outlined in President Trump's domestic policy legislation, or what he calls\u00a0\"one big beautiful bill,\"\u00a0which is currently being debated in the Senate. The bill includes changes to Medicaid, a program that provides government-sponsored health care, which could leave many low-income and disabled Americans without coverage.",

The agency announced last week that a part of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth is being terminated.",
      "Rep. Troy Carter, a Democrat from Louisiana, questioned Kennedy on\u00a0cuts to HIV vaccine research. In May, the Trump administration moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus. But experts disagree, including Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research, who previously told CBS News it's a \"terrible time\" to cut off the research, adding that it could not \"simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding.\"",

      "Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey accused Kennedy of trying to \"defend the indefensible\" with his actions as secretary.",
      "\"There's no way that this budget or the actions you have taken thus far as secretary are going to make this country healthier,\" Pallone said. \"The science is not on your side. I just really think that people are going to die as a result of your actions.\"",
      "Pallone also criticized Kennedy for not allowing for a typical process of public comments when it comes to \"major decisions about vaccines.\"",
      "\"Are you just afraid of receiving public comments on proposals where you just think these are fringe views that are contrary to the views of most scientists and that the public comments will reflect this?\" he said. \"You say you want transparency, but there's been no public process for any of this.\"",
      "Kennedy said the ACIP committee \u2014 the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices \u2014 was the public process for regulating vaccines.",
      "\"You fired the ACIP committee,\" Pallone said.",
      "\"I fired people who had conflicts with the pharmaceutical industry,\" Kennedy replied. Earlier this month, he replaced the entire committee with\u00a0new picks, including some with ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers.",
      "Later, Kennedy accused Pallone of taking money from the pharmaceutical industry, which prompted fellow Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado to call for a point of order for \"impugning the reputation of a member of Congress.\"",
      "Chairman Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican, asked Kennedy if he wanted to take it back, and Kennedy retracted his comments about Pallone.",
      "Earlier in the hearing, DeGette questioned Kennedy on the White House's Department of Government Efficiency's \"defend the spend\" initiative, which the Washington Post reports has caused thousands of backed-up payments to doctors and nurses. Kennedy denied knowing about it.",
      "\"Do you know anything about the 'defend the spend' initiative?\" DeGette asked.",
      "\"About what?\" Kennedy asked.",
      "\"The 'defend the spend' initiative that your agency has?\" she repeated.",
      "\"No,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Kennedy defends NIH funding cuts, talks seed oils",
      "In defense of his NIH funding cuts, Kennedy said he cut \"thousands of studies\" that were doing \"nothing to improve American health\" and instead offered other topics he thinks should be a focus of research.",
      "\"Very few of the studies that were being done by NIH were being done on chronic disease,\" Kennedy said. \"NIH should be telling us: what are seed oils doing to our children? What are \u2014 what is corn syrup doing to our children? What are food dyes doing to our children? What is the packaging and microplastics doing to our children? What are pesticides doing to our children?\"",
      "Kennedy also claimed he doesn't know about the letter to NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya earlier this month from NIH scientists criticizing the administration's deep funding cuts.",
      "COVID vaccines and pregnancy",
      "Kennedy said last month that he would remove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19.",
      "At Tuesday's hearing, Kennedy said \"study after study shows adverse events\" after COVID-19 shots during pregnancy. Without citing where the study came from, Kennedy said one study showed \"27 adverse events during pregnancy.\"",
      "Officials at the Food and Drug Administration, however,\u00a0recently reiterated\u00a0that pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals.",
      "\"We're not depriving anybody of choice,\" Kennedy said. \"If a pregnant woman wants the COVID-19 vaccine, she can get it. We're no longer recommending it because there was no science supporting that recommendation.\"",
      "\"Not true,\" Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois rebutted. \"We have a pediatrician that is on this committee. Not true.\"",
      "House Democrat Kim Schrier of Washington is a former pediatrician, who said during her allotted time that she found it \"extremely alarming\" that Kennedy announced changes to vaccine recommendations \"without consulting the customary panel of experts.\"",
      "\"You have lied to the American people\"",
      "In her line of questioning, Schrier accused Kennedy of \"lying\" to a U.S. senator about not making any changes to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and doctor, eventually voted to confirm Kennedy for HHS secretary. Kennedy denied lying to the senator about the vaccine panel.",
      "\"But then two weeks ago, you fired all 17 experts on that very committee,\" Schrier said. \"Did you lie to Sen. Cassidy when you told him you would not change this panel of experts?\"",
      "Kennedy responded by saying he \"never made that agreement.\"",
      "\"So are you saying that Senator Cassidy lied when he was on the Senate floor, lied to the American people?\" Schrier said.",
      "\"If he said that I agreed to it, it would be inaccurate,\" Kennedy said.",
      "\"It sounds to me like you gave him the answer he needed to hear in order to get his confirmation vote, and then as soon as you were secretary, you turned around and did whatever you want,\" Schrier said.",
      "\"I'm complying with all the agreements I made with Sen. Cassidy,\" Kennedy responded.",
      "\"Mr. Secretary, you're now on the record. You lied to Sen. Cassidy. You have lied to the American people, you have lied to parents about vaccines for 20 years, and I also want to be clear that I will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet,\" Schrier said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Cassidy said, \"As Senator Cassidy has said publicly, the commitment was about the ACIP process, not staffing.\"",
      "Republicans praise Kennedy",
      "Some Republicans referred to\u00a0Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\"\u00a0or \"MAHA\" motto, including Langworthy, who told the secretary, \"I appreciate your leadership and your vision and your efforts to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Dr. John Joyce, a Pennsylvania Republican and a dermatologist who serves as vice-chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, thanked Kennedy for his \"commitments to unlocking American science that we know will lead to additional breakthroughs.\"",
      "Kennedy told Joyce he was committed to ensuring incentives for innovators are put in place to pursue \"gold standard science for rare disease treatments and for their cures.\"",
      "Virginia Republican Morgan Griffith, seemingly making a comparison to Kennedy, said: \"I would remind everybody that Galileo got an 'F' during his day and age, and that sometimes people who are trying to do cutting-edge work don't get the response they expect from leading scientists of the day.\"",
      "During the hearing, Kennedy made other commitments to Republicans lawmakers, including expanding the use of the Trump administration's new FDA priority vouchers because it \"crashes through the red tape\"; speeding access to prescription psychedelics; urging all Americans to use wearables like glucose monitors; promoting non-opioid painkiller Journavx; and redoing the dietary guidelines by August.",
      "\"We're about to launch one of the biggest advertising campaigns in HHS history,\" Kennedy said, referring to the glucose monitors.",

    "summary": "Ahead of U.S. strikes on Iran, one U.S. intel assessment concluded Iran could build a nuclear weapon in months but didn't assess it decided to do so, intel sources said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 On the same day that President Trump ordered Saturday's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, a U.S. intelligence agency assessed that Iran could make a nuclear weapon in three to eight months \u2014 but there was no indication that it had decided to do so, CBS News has learned.",
      "The intelligence summary, issued Saturday for the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, found that Iran could build a nuclear device in months if it did not run into technical or logistical delays, two American intelligence sources familiar with the document told CBS News.",
      "But at that time, the summary did not assess that Iran had made a decision to sprint toward a nuclear weapon \u2014 lining up with U.S. assessments for years.",
      "Similar assessments were made in the days leading up to the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, and in the days afterward. The U.S. airstrikes came amid a wider dayslong Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear facilities, though Mr. Trump announced Monday that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "The intelligence summary also found that Iranian officials had discussed moving canisters of highly enriched uranium into car trunks and storing them in public parking lots to avoid destruction.",
      "Iran has increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in recent months, sparking concerns among both Iran's adversaries and international watchdogs. The country has enriched uranium up to 60% purity, which is only a short step away from the 90% level generally used in nuclear weapons.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week Iran was \"very close to having\" a nuclear weapon, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Iran \"is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly.\"",
      "The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla, testified in mid-June that if Iran were to decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it would be able to produce enough weapons-grade material for a simple nuclear weapon in one week and could make enough for 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said for years that Iran formally halted its nuclear weapons development program in 2003. In March, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still had not reauthorized the program, but \"pressure has probably built on him to do so\" \u2014 noting an \"erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public.\"",
      "Different agencies in the intelligence community may have their own assessments about what Iran's nuclear capabilities were prior to the strikes.",
      "Gabbard reiterated that assessment in testimony to Congress earlier this year. But last week, Mr. Trump told reporters Gabbard was \"wrong\" about whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon, later adding, \"I think they were very close to having one.\" Gabbard later said she and the president were on the same page, and the media was \"taking my testimony out of context.\"",
      "The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following\u00a0 a dayslong air campaign by Israel, which has alleged Iran is \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\" The impact of the weekend strikes by the U.S. is still not clear; the Pentagon offered a preliminary public assessment of the damage soon after the strikes.",
      "\"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Sunday, adding that a full assessment would take time.",
      "Iran, for its part, has long denied that it intends to build nuclear weapons, and insists its uranium enrichment program is meant for peaceful purposes.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' \"Face The Nation\" on Sunday that the Iranian sites targeted in the U.S. strikes were linked to Iran's \"nuclear weaponization ambitions.\" When asked whether the U.S. believed Khamenei had ordered the building of a nuclear weapon, Rubio called the issue \"irrelevant.\"",
      "\"They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons,\" Rubio said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump and the administration have always been right to say that if Iran chose to make a nuclear bomb, they could do so within weeks, which obviously poses an imminent threat to the US and the world.\"",
      "\"[T]hanks to President Trump's strong leadership and the incredibly successful military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, their capacity to build a nuclear bomb has been obliterated and the world can sleep easy at night,\" she added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-big-beautiful-bill-postal-service-sell-new-ev-delivery-trucks/",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 19:18:46 -0400",
    "summary": "But the Senate parliamentarian says the Postal Service's 7,200 new EVs can't be auctioned off.",
    "story": [
      "Last September, the U.S. Postal Service debuted its long-awaited \u2014 and much litigated \u2014 electric vehicle mail delivery truck. Since then, more than 7,200 new zero-emissions vehicles have been distributed to the Postal Service.",
      "But a provision tucked inside the Senate Republican bill to enact President Trump's second-term agenda would force the USPS to sell off the brand new trucks and cancel or significantly amend the contract for the remaining 58,800 that are due to be delivered over the next 10 years.",
      "According to the text of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs portion of the bill released by Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul, chair of the committee, all electric vehicles and related infrastructure owned by the Postal Service will be sold and the proceeds will \"be deposited into the general fund of the treasury.\" Selling the EVs would \"cut unnecessary costs and focus USPS on delivering mail and not achieving the environmental initiatives pushed by the Biden Administration,\" according to the bill.",
      "Paul's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Peter Pastre, the vice president of government relations and public policy for USPS, wrote a letter to the Senate in June that said the provision to sell the EVs would \"make major and damaging changes to the U.S. Postal Service's vehicle fleet program, potentially impacting our ability to deliver to millions of Americans.\"",
      "The bill is being considered under budget reconciliation rules, which means that Republicans can pass it with a simple majority, instead of meeting the 60-vote threshold that is required to consider most Senate legislation. In order to use this approach, every item in the bill must have a budgetary impact, and the Senate parliamentarian determines whether each provision meets that standard, known as the Byrd Rule.",
      "Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough found that disposing of the USPS EVs is one of several of the bill's provisions violating the Byrd Rule, according to Senate Democrats.",
      "\"Scrapping USPS' electric vehicles is a lose-lose scenario,\" Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, ranking member of the Budget Committee, told CBS News in a statement. \"We move backwards on clean energy and have to spend even more money to replace the vehicles.\"",
      "Republicans, who would like to revoke the EVs and their related infrastructure, say this provision could potentially raise money by rescinding $1 billion allocated in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act to purchase the vehicles. But according to Pastre, it would cost more than $450 million to replace the 7,200 revoked vehicles, and the USPS has already spent more than $540 million on electrical upgrades for infrastructure to support the cars.",
      "Because the majority of the vehicles are specially designed for the Postal Service \u2014 like right-side driving for mail delivery trucks \u2014 and most of the electrical infrastructure is buried under ground, the potential for raising money at auction is \"negligible,\" according to Pastre.",
      "Pastre was direct about the harm this action would cause the Postal Service saying, \"it will seriously cripple our ability to replace an aging and obsolete delivery fleet.\"",
      "\"The Postal Service has over 200,000 vehicles in an outdated and aging fleet. Using EVs will reduce fuel and maintenance costs and help the USPS to better serve the public,\" Mark Dimondstein, president of American Postal Workers Union, said in an email to CBS News. \"Eliminating energy-efficient vehicles would be a step backward and not be in the best interest of those we serve and the communities where we live.\"",
      "Since 2015, the USPS has been looking to update and modernize its fleet of more than 200,000 vehicles. The majority of the trucks were 25 years old or more, often lacked proper heating and cooling and in some cases, would spontaneously combust in neighborhoods as workers operated the aging vehicles.",
      "When the Postal Service first announced its proposal in 2021 to replace 165,000 vehicles, it originally intended to purchase traditional gas vehicles to replace 90% of the fleet. But the gas-powered mail trucks had low fuel efficiency, guzzling fuel at under a 9-m.p.g. rate, according to filings by several environmental organizations and more than a dozen states that sued to block the plan.",
      "\"It's important that EVs be part of the mix for the USPS because it should represent the next generation,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the organizations that sued the USPS in 2021. \"The last generation of vehicles are literally dying on its wheels.\"",
      "The legal action forced the USPS to reconsider its plan, and it finalized a deal in late 2022 to purchase 106,000 new cars \u2014 and 66,000 were to be zero-emissions vehicles. It also planned to install more than 14,000 chargers to keep the fleet running. The cost to update the fleet totaled $9.6 billion, and the Biden administration allocated $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act to help cover the costs, with the rest financed by the Postal Service.",
      "\"My bet is this will survive another day,\" said Becker, given that the parliamentarian has ruled it should be stricken and it would be difficult to get 60 votes in the Senate to keep it in the bill. But Congress recently voted to revoke California's EPA waivers to enact its EV mandate under the Congressional Review Act, which the parliamentarian said was illegal. It remains to be seen if Republicans will follow her recommendations.",
      "\"Selling them off at a discount just so you don't have to say you don't have EVs for political reasons makes no sense,\" said Becker.",

      "In its latest crackdown against illegal immigration, federal agents arrested 11 Iranian foreign nationals in 48 hours, including one watchlisted individual \u2014 part of a series of targeted operations spanning eight states and nine cities nationwide.",
      "Among those arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Sunday, June 22, is Mehran Makari Saheli, at his home near St. Paul, Minnesota. ICE officials say Saheli is a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an elite branch of Iran's armed forces. They said the detainee has \"admitted connections to Hezbollah,\" a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran.",
      "ICE said that five of those arrested possessed previous criminal convictions ranging from grand larceny to drug and firearm possessions.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security says Yousef Mehridehno had been living in America illegally for nearly 8 years when federal authorities determined he lied on a visa application. Roughly four months after the Iranian foreign national was added to the U.S. known or suspected terrorist list in February, he was apprehended by federal agents Sunday in central Mississippi, just outside of Jackson.",
      "Officials have not linked these arrests to any specific terrorism plots and the Department of Homeland Security has stated that there are no current, credible threats to the U.S. homeland, despite a heightened security environment following U.S. strikes\u00a0on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend.",
      "But all 11 Iranians have been charged or accused of crimes beyond civil immigration violations, according to ICE officials, who say the arrested men represent a threat to public safety.",
      "While arresting Ribvar Karmi in northern Alabama on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security says federal agents found an Islamic Republic of Iran Army identification card on his person. According to ICE officials, Karimi purportedly served as an Iranian Army sniper from 2018 to 2021 and entered the U.S. in October 2024 on a K-1 visa, reserved for migrants engaged to be married to American citizens. Karmi is now detained in ICE custody, where officials say he will remain pending removal proceedings.",
      "In Colorado Springs on Sunday, ICE officials arrested Mahmoud Shafiei and Mehrdad Mehdipour, Iranian nationals who were living at the same home and who both had orders of removal against them. ICE said Shafiei has a criminal history that includes state and federal convictions for drug crimes and arrests for assault and child abuse.",
      "In addition to the 11 Iranian nationals who were arrested, federal agents have also arrested U.S. citizen Linet Vartaniann, who was taken into custody on federal charges of threatening a law enforcement officer and harboring an illegal alien. ICE officials contend the woman threatened to open fire if immigration enforcement officers entered her home. According to ICE, the defendant threatened federal agents during an encounter on Sunday, warning she would go outside and \"shoot officers in the head.\"",
      "ICE officials tell CBS News that the arrests since Sunday are part of the Trump administration's latest crackdown on illegal immigration. Federal officials have aimed to dramatically ramp up immigration arrests, with average daily arrests climbing from 660 in President Trump's first 100 days to 1,200 in June \u2014 and the White House says its target is 3,000 arrests per day.",
      "\"We have been saying we are getting the worst of the worst out \u2014 and we are,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News. \"We don't wait until a military operation to execute; we proactively deliver on President Trump's mandate to secure the homeland.\"",
      "According to U.S. government data, last fiscal year, 68 Iranian foreign nationals were arrested by ICE \u2014 including 47 with criminal convictions. ICE arrested some 113,000 people in total over that period, most of whom were from Mexico or Central America.",
      "This weekend, the Department of Homeland Security activated its National Terrorism Advisory System just hours after the United States' attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The strikes came after a days-long Israeli campaign against Iran, resulting in Iranian attacks on Israel \u2014 though Mr. Trump said Monday\u00a0the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire.",

    "summary": "Former DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni says he was fired after pushing back on orders from top officials, including Emil Bove, to defy court rulings.",
    "story": [
      "An ousted Justice Department attorney told Congress that senior department officials, including a former acting deputy attorney general, discussed defying federal court orders and withholding information from judges to advance the Trump administration's immigration priorities, according to a whistleblower complaint filed Tuesday.",
      "The attorney, Erez Reuveni, a veteran of over 14 years at the department who had been praised and promoted for his service, was put on leave and then fired earlier this year after his attorneys say he pushed back against three different Justice Department attempts to \"defy\" immigration-related court orders \"through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation.\"",
      "While Reuveni has not spoken publicly about his departure, a whistleblower report sent to senior congressional leadership by his attorneys details how he says he was \"threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged\" in his final weeks in the department after he questioned instructions from top Justice Department officials to ignore court orders and misrepresent facts in court in three separate, high-profile standoffs between the department and federal judges over immigration cases. Among those officials was the No. 3 Justice Department official, Emil Bove.",
      "Bove nominated in May by President Trump to sit on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and is scheduled to appear for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Before his stint as a top Justice Department official, Bove represented Mr. Trump in his criminal trial in Manhattan last year.",
      "Reuveni's attorneys described in his complaint a meeting with Justice Department officials about contesting possible court orders blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He alleged that Bove, who at the time was principal assistant deputy attorney general, said that the department \"would need to consider telling the courts 'f*** you' and ignore any such court order,\" and that the deportation \"planes needed to take off no matter what.\"",
      "\"Mr. Reuveni was in disbelief,\" his attorneys wrote, adding that others in the room were \"stunned\" by the suggestion that the Justice Department would tell its clients in the government to disobey court rulings against the administration.",
      "A day after the meeting, the complaint said, a Washington, D.C., federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador and ordered planes carrying the men to return back to the U.S. The Trump administration did not reroute the flights.",
      "Reuveni also said that Drew Ensign, one of his supervisors, knowingly told a judge that he didn't know if more Alien Enemies Act removals were underway \u2014 even though Ensign was present for the Justice Department meeting when Bove told his team the deportations would continue.",
      "After repeatedly voicing concerns in phone calls and emails that the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department had violated the court's orders by not returning the migrants, Reuveni said he received a phone call from a DHS attorney telling him to \"consult DOJ leadership if he had any questions\" about the decision.",
      "In a separate incident days later, Reuveni's attorneys allege that he was \"told to stop asking questions\" by senior Justice Department leaders after he attempted \"to ascertain whether DOJ had violated a court order\" in Massachusetts that blocked the removal of migrants to third-party countries with no due process, after he saw evidence that the removals were still underway.",
      "The complaint says that Yakov Roth, an assistant attorney general, called Reuveni to tell him that \"Bove was very unhappy\" that he was looking into why the removals had continued, in spite of a nationwide injunction blocking them.",
      "And in April, Reuveni unsuccessfully argued in defense of the controversial and mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, admitting in court that the man \"should not have been removed\" from the U.S. to El Salvador.",
      "In the days leading up to an initial hearing in Abrego Garcia's case, Reuveni's attorneys say he \"repeatedly and consistently requested updates on efforts to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. and assurances of his safety,\" in the Salvadoran supermax prison where he was being detained.",
      "Those efforts were stonewalled, the attorneys say, after Reuveni was told by his bosses to \"stop asking for facts supporting any possible defense of the case,\" despite raising \"concerns in multiple emails to both DHS and DOS about the sufficiency of the evidence to support Mr. Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation and the lack of action to correct his erroneous removal.\"",
      "After Reuveni conceded in court that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed, a Maryland judge ordered him to be returned to the United States. As a result, a supervisor told Reuveni that the White House had questions as to why he didn't argue that Abrego Garcia was an alleged gang member and that the removal was justified, despite a court order to the contrary.",
      "Hours later, department leadership asked Reuveni to sign an appeal brief of the Maryland judge's order.\u00a0 He says he refused, telling a supervisor that he \"didn't sign up to lie.\"",
      "Reuveni was placed on administrative leave shortly afterwards for, according to a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, \"failure to follow a directive from your superiors; failure to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States; and engaging in conduct prejudicial to your client.\"",
      "After the news that Reuveni had been put on leave became public, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement to CBS News that \"every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\"",
      "Less than a week later, Reuveni was fired.",
      "Reuveni's attorneys said that the consequences of the Justice Department actions alleged by Reuveni \"have grave impacts not only for the safety of individuals removed from the country in violation of court orders, but also for the constitutional rights and protections of all persons \u2013 citizen and noncitizen alike \u2013 who are potential victims of flagrant, deliberate disregard of due process and the rule of law by the agency charged with upholding it.\"",
      "The whistleblower account was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "In a post on X following the article's publication, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Reuveni's account contains \"falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee,\" and said he was in the meeting where Bove allegedly said he would not follow court orders. Blanche said that \"at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed.\"",
      "The Justice Department also defended Bove's handling of the deportation cases.",
      "\"Having entered office with a mandate to end the invasion of illegal alien criminals, Emil Bove has been a relentless advocate for the enforcement of our immigration laws and the removal of violent killers, terrorist gang leaders, and child predators, all of whom should never have been allowed to invade our borders, which is why Emil will be an outstanding federal judge to keep our country safe and uphold the rights of all Americans,\" the department said in a statement.",
      "A statement by Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Reuveni's claims \"not only speak to Mr. Bove's failure to fulfill his ethical obligations as a lawyer, but demonstrate that his activities are part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his allies to undermine the Justice Department's commitment to the rule of law.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-strikes-iran-cbs-news-opinion-poll/",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 17:58:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Most would see an Iranian nuclear weapon as a serious threat but also voice concern about a wider war.",
    "story": [
      "As the public assesses the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, at least three things are in play.",
      "One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be.",
      "Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however \u2014 and netting out to a majority overall \u2014 there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war.",
      "Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon.",
      "Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran.",
      "Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern.",
      "Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.",
      "Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall.",
      "A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran.",
      "Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall.",
      "Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.)",
      "The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war.",
      "Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel.",
      "Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession. That sentiment has not abated in recent months.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,720 U.S. adults interviewed between June 22-24, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

      "Washington \u2014 The FBI is intensifying its focus and resources on counterterrorism threats after the United States\u00a0carried out strikes\u00a0on three Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend, and Iran countered with an attack of its own on an American air base in Qatar.",
      "Two sources told CBS News that a memo was distributed to FBI field office directors in the past 48 hours instructing them to focus resources on terror threats, including domestically.",
      "The memo follows a separate, unrelated internal report sent earlier this month in which the FBI forecasted that it would need to concentrate resources on Iran in the coming months. The report stated that a priority would be \"helping to apply maximum pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran and its terror proxies. This includes investigating, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting financial and logistical networks, operatives, and front groups; targeting related foreign-based hacking operations; targeting the leaders and members of terrorist groups and terror proxies responsible for capturing, harming, or killing American citizens, and seizing illicit Iranian oil exports.\"",
      "It comes after the FBI has received multiple internal complaints from employees about being pulled off counterterrorism and counterintelligence tasks to focus on immigration enforcement, according to two other sources who spoke to CBS News. The complaints warned of pressure being placed on FBI agents to \"maximize the number of immigration arrests.\"",
      "An FBI spokesperson said the bureau \"does not comment on specific operational adjustments or personnel decisions. However, we continuously assess and realign our resources to respond to the most pressing threats to our national security and to ensure the safety of the American people.\"",
      "President Trump has made a crackdown on illegal immigration and mass deportations a focal point of his second term. He has\u00a0invoked a wartime law\u00a0known as the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport migrants,\u00a0rolled back\u00a0programs\u00a0shielding people\u00a0from the threat of deportation, and approached other countries about\u00a0accepting migrants who are not their citizens.",
      "Workplace arrests by immigration authorities in Los Angeles County earlier this month sparked protests and\u00a0led the president to call\u00a0roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service under a law known as\u00a0Title 10.

      "\"Since the start of the conflict, we have seen media releases by foreign terrorist organizations ... some of which have called for violence against US assets and personnel in the Middle East,\" the advisory warned. \"Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out precision strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Mr. Trump announced in an address to the nation Saturday night. He said the assault, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, aimed to cripple Iran's nuclear program.",
      "In response to the strikes, Iran\u00a0launched a ballistic missile attack\u00a0targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday. Mr. Trump indicated that the U.S. was given advance warning of the Iranian attack, and there were no American or Qatari casualties.",
      "The attack came after Israel\u00a0launched strikes\u00a0against Iranian nuclear and military targets starting June 13, which prompted missile counterattacks by Iran. As of Tuesday,\u00a0at least 974 people\u00a0have been killed in Iran, according to the organization Human Rights Activists in Iran.

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Monday the federal government will fund an effort by Florida to set up immigration detention centers, which include a proposed site in the Everglades that state officials have dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"",
      "Noem said the detention facilities in Florida will be funded \"in large part\" by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's shelter and services program, an initiative created by Congress to support groups and cities receiving migrants and asylum-seekers released from federal custody along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Primarily charged with overseeing disaster relief efforts, FEMA is an agency within the Department of Homeland Security that has faced significant cuts under the second Trump administration.",
      "\"Under President Trump's leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens,\" Noem said in a statement to CBS News. \"We will expand facilities and bed space in just days, thanks to our partnership with Florida.\"",
      "Officials in Tallahassee first announced plans to help the federal government expand its capacity to hold detainees awaiting deportation last week.",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said a largely abandoned airfield in the Everglades would be repurposed as a detention facility to house immigrants living in the U.S. illegally with criminal records. He dubbed it \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" saying any detainees seeking to escape would face alligators and pythons in the treacherous wetlands surrounding the site.",
      "On Monday, Uthmeier announced the federal government had \"approved\" the state's plan to build \"Alligator Alcatraz\" and other facilities that he said could collectively house as many as 5,000 detainees. He said the facilities could start receiving detainees early next month, calling them temporary.",
      "\"There's really nowhere to go. If you're housed there, if you're detained there, there's no way in, no way out,\" Uthmeier said in an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson, describing the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" facility.",

      "On his way to The Hague on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called on lawmakers to stay in Washington until they can resolve their issues and get the bill \u2014 which extends the president's 2017 tax cuts and includes much of his second-term agenda \u2014 to his desk.",
      "\"NO ONE GOES ON VACATION UNTIL IT'S DONE,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The last scheduled day in session for both chambers before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving them with little time to reach their goal.",

      "Still, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, threatened to keep senators in Washington over the recess as several Republicans cast doubt about the upper chamber's ability to finish their work before the deadline.",
      "Thune told reporters Monday that the Senate is \"on schedule\" to vote by the end of the week.",
      "The bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u00a0narrowly passed the House last month, but Senate Republicans are making changes in order to navigate the party's tight 53-47 margin in the upper chamber.",
      "On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he told House Republicans to \"keep your schedules flexible\" as the Senate looks to send the legislation back to the lower chamber for approval.

      "The Senate parliamentarian advised that several controversial provisions would violate the Byrd Rule, which requires that the legislation only include provisions that have a direct impact on federal spending, according to Senate Budget Committee Democrats.",
      "Provisions that did not make the cut are subject to a 60-vote threshold, compared with the 51 votes needed under the reconciliation process.",
      "Republicans can't include language that would make it harder to challenge the government's actions in court. The provision limited the ability of federal courts to delay or halt the government's policies by requiring people suing the federal government to post a bond to cover the potential costs and damages incurred by the government.",
      "The parliamentarian determined that a provision to bar immigrants who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents from receiving food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, should also be removed.",
      "The parliamentarian also rejected a proposal championed by Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah that would have sold off millions of acres of public lands.",
      "Other provisions struck from the bill include the sale of electric vehicles used by the United States Postal Service and several immigration-related measures, including limiting certain funding for \"sanctuary cities\" and allowing states to conduct border security and immigration enforcement.",
      "But the parliamentarian did allow Republicans to keep a 10-year moratorium on state laws regulating artificial intelligence.",
      "SALT sticking points",
      "As the Senate lurches toward a vote on the bill, disagreement over the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, has persisted. But Bessent said Tuesday afternoon that he expected a solution on what's become one of the biggest sticking points will be reached in the next 24 to 48 hours.",
      "While the House measure increases the deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, the Senate Finance Committee's version that was unveiled last week proposes permanently extending the $10,000 cap. The chasm sparked pushback among blue-state House Republicans, who have threatened to withhold their support should the Senate approve the changes and send it back to the House.",
      "Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, who formerly served in the House and has worked as a messenger between the two chambers, told reporters Monday that \"neither side is going to love where we're at, but it's going to be acceptable.\"",

      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding by lowering provider taxes \u2014 which states use to help fund their share of Medicaid costs \u2014 from 6% to 3.5% by 2031, after the House sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes. But the move has sparked pushback, and threatened to complicate the delicate balance reached in the House.",
      "A group of 16 House Republicans penned a letter to Thune and Johnson Tuesday opposing the Senate's changes to the House-passed legislation on Medicaid.

      "Earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump voiced frustration with both countries and accused them of violating the agreement he had announced just hours earlier. Israel accused Iran of breaching the agreement minutes after it was intended to take effect, and said it would \"respond forcefully.\"",
      "But after a last-minute intervention by Mr. Trump \u2014 including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 the bombardments appeared to cease.",
      "How the ceasefire deal announced by Trump took shape",
      "Mr. Trump said Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed to a \"Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,\" a move he said would end the 12-day conflict between the two countries.",
      "The ceasefire would take hold in stages, the president said. A White House official told CBS News that Iran would halt strikes against Israel from midnight Eastern Time, and Israel was to stop striking Iran 12 hours after that, from noon ET on Tuesday. Another 12 hours after that, or at midnight ET on Wednesday morning, the war would be considered over.",
      "Tuesday morning, Israel accused Iran of launching several missiles at Israeli territory. At least one made impact in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people. It was unclear at the time whether the missiles were fired before or after the ceasefire was due to take effect, but Israel's defense chief accused Iran of breaching the agreement, and ordered a response. Israel later said it had launched a final round of strikes on Iran, before the ceasefire began.",
      "\"In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation \u2014 I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,\" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.",
      "President Trump was quick to respond to defend his deal, saying in a message posted on his Truth Social network: \"ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!\"",
      "As he prepared to depart for a NATO summit on Tuesday, he was asked if he believed Iran or Israel had violated the ceasefire.",
      "\"I think they both violated it. I don't think, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back,\" Mr. Trump said. But he appeared to direct particular criticism at Israel.",
      "\"I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to a number of strikes on Iran that Israel said it carried out just before the ceasefire was due to begin.",
      "\"Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he would \"see if I can stop it.\"",
      "\"I'm not happy with them,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing, you understand that?\"",
      "Soon after, Israel said Mr. Trump had spoken by phone with Netanyahu.",
      "A White House source told CBS News that Mr. Trump was \"exceptionally firm and direct\" in the call about what needed to happen to sustain the ceasefire, and the source said Netanyahu had \"understood the severity of the situation and the concerns President Trump expressed.\"",
      "In a statement after their call, Netanyahu's office said Israel had \"refrained from further attacks\" after carrying out a limited strike on a radar site outside Tehran, in retaliation for Iran's latest missile launches.",
      "Israel's timeline of airstrikes and missile exchange with Iran",

      "\"Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which claimed the lives of four of our citizens in Beersheba,\" the statement said, adding that after 7 a.m., when the ceasefire began, Iran fired additional missiles.",
      "\"At 7:06 AM, Iran launched one missile into Israeli territory and at 10:25 AM, two more missiles.

    "summary": "The NATO summit follows a U.S. operation striking Iranian nuclear sites \u2014 and the announcement by President Trump of a ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday heads to a whirlwind NATO summit at the Hague, Netherlands, hours after he announced that Iran and Israel had reached a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Several hours after the ceasefire was to take effect, Mr. Trump told reporters as he left for the summit that both Israel and Iran had violated it. Then, after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president said Israel would not bomb Iran again, and that \"the ceasefire is in effect.\"",
      "The president hoped to secure during the summit a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense. But a day before he was to arrive, the alliance had already agreed to the boost in defense spending, according to Matthew Whitaker, U.S. ambassador to NATO. He told reporters in a briefing Monday that as a result of Mr. Trump's leadership, NATO was \"on track\" to make that \"historic commitment\" of 5%.",
      "During the flight to the Netherlands, Mr. Trump posted an effusive note from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulating him on his actions in Iran and on the new NATO defense spending levels.",
      "\"[T]hank you for your decisive action in Iran,\" Rutte wrote. He called it \"truly extraordinary\" and said it was \"something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer.\"",
      "And of the new spending, Rutte said, \"It was not easy, but we've got them all signed onto 5 percent!\" He called it an \"important moment for America and Europe,\" and told him, \"You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.\" A NATO spokesperson confirmed that Rutte had written the text to Mr. Trump.",
      "The U.S. spent roughly 3.4% of GDP on defense in 2023, but the president has said he thinks the U.S. should not have the same 5% target.",
      "\"We've been supporting NATO so long, in many cases, I believe, paying almost 100% of the cost,\" he told reporters Friday. \"So, I don't think we should, but I think that the NATO countries should, absolutely.\"",
      "There is no clear timeline for the 5% commitment, however, and reaching that threshold could extend into the 2030s for some NATO countries, fueling criticism that the 5% promise could be an empty one.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who is at the Hague with a bipartisan group of senators, expressed optimism about the allies' efforts to raise their defense spending.",
      "\"I think everybody is united around this goal and trying to figure out how fast we can get there,\" she told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe, who is also in the Netherlands for the summit.",
      "Aside from the conflict in the Middle East, Russia's war on Ukraine continues to be a top topic of concern for NATO members. It is not yet clear whether the U.S. will support language citing Russia as the main threat to NATO in its communique \u2014 Whitaker avoided directly answering a reporter's question about this.",
      "\"Negotiations regarding the communique are still underway, so I'm not going to be able to comment directly on the specific language,\" Whitaker said, adding, \"I fully expect that the summit statement will be direct, to the point, and reflect the Allies' current threat assessment and the need for collective defense and the individual defense of all Allies.\"",
      "He said that the U.S. is \"calling for restraint and [urging] both parties to avoid escalation,\" and he went on to say that the U.S. is \"engaged at the highest levels\" and backs direct talks between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Shaheen said she'd like to see the U.S. \"put a lot more pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin,\" and she added, \"I think we need to pass the tough sanctions bill that we have in the Senate that has 82 sponsors.\"",
      "Shortly before the summit, on Saturday, the U.S. carried out strikes targeting\u00a0three Iranian sites\u00a0believed to be key to\u00a0Iran's nuclear program.

      "Mr. Trump called the retaliatory strikes \"very weak,\" and he said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\" Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei also pointed out in a social media post after the Iranian strikes, \"We didn't harm anyone.\"",
      "Within hours, Mr. Trump made the announcement that Iran and Israel would implement a ceasefire and shortly bring the war to an end.",
      "The NATO summit will feature a single two-and-a-half-hour session, instead of multiple sessions. Mr. Trump also plans to meet separately with several world leaders on the sidelines, a senior U.S. official told reporters on a conference call Friday.",

      "NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is the largest defense alliance in the world, with 32 members, including the U.S. It was formed in the aftermath of World War II, and has grown since, with its latest additions being Finland in 2023 and Sweden in 2024.

    "summary": "The Supreme Court agreed to pause a judge's order that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without first providing them due process.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday lifted a lower court order that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to countries that are not their places of origin without first giving them the chance to raise fears of torture, persecution or death.",
      "The order from the high court is a victory for the Trump administration, which has faced recent setbacks from the justices in its efforts to swiftly deport migrants as part of its crackdown on immigration. The Supreme Court's order clears the way for the Trump administration to resume deportations to third countries while legal proceedings continue.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision Monday regarding third country removals.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Sotomayor accused the federal government of \"flagrantly unlawful conduct\" and called the majority's decision to intervene at this stage in the case \"inexcusable.\"",
      "\"The government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard,\" she wrote, joined by Kagan and Jackson.",
      "Sotomayor said that the court is \"rewarding lawlessness\" with a decision that will undermine the foundational principle of due process.",
      "\"Apparently, the court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a district court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled,\" Sotomayor said. \"That use of discretion is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security called the Supreme Court ruling \"a victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "\"DHS can now execute its lawful authority and remove illegal aliens to a country willing to accept them,\" the statement read in part. \"Fire up the deportation planes.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's latest order came in a court fight over the Trump administration's efforts to swiftly deport some migrants to third countries, or countries other than the ones designated on an order of removal. As part of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda and plans for mass deportations, his administration has approached nations like Costa Rica, Panama and Rwanda about accepting migrants who are not their citizens.",
      "The administration has also already entered into an arrangement with the government of El Salvador to detain Venezuelan migrants who it claims are gang members, though a \"60 Minutes\" investigation found most have no apparent criminal records. The migrants have been confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, often under a 1798 wartime law.",
      "The Supreme Court previously said in a\u00a0pair\u00a0of\u00a0decisions\u00a0arising from other emergency appeals that migrants facing deportation under that wartime law must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removals in court.",
      "Four migrants from Latin America filed a broader lawsuit in March on behalf of a nationwide class of all people potentially subject to third-country removals and argued they are entitled to notice and an opportunity to contest their removals on the grounds they fear persecution, torture and death.",
      "In the weeks after the suit was filed, administration officials were engaged in a simmering showdown with a Boston-based federal judge, who in April found that the government had violated migrants' due process rights and blocked immigration authorities from quickly removing them to third countries unless certain steps are first taken.",
      "The judge, Brian Murphy, said the government first had to give the affected migrants written notice of the third country to which they may be deported and a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise fears of torture, persecution or death in that country.",
      "Third-country deportations challenged in court",
      "Since Murphy issued his nationwide injunction in April, immigration lawyers have notified him that a group of migrants from Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines were being prepared to be deported to Libya and Saudi Arabia, though the deportation flights do not appear to have happened. Murphy then concluded last month that the Trump administration violated his order when it attempted to swiftly deport a group of men with criminal histories to war-torn South Sudan with less than 24 hours notice and no chance for them to raise fear-based claims.",
      "South Sudan endured a bloody years-long civil war shortly after gaining independence in 2011, and the United Nations\u00a0warns\u00a0violence has escalated in recent months. The State Department has\u00a0warned\u00a0Americans not to travel to the country due to \"crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.",
      "Murphy halted the deportations to South Sudan, and the men are being held at a U.S. naval base in nearby Djibouti, a small country on the Horn of Africa. The judge said federal immigration authorities must give six of the deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews to determine whether they are at risk of persecution or torture.",
      "Murphy left it up to the Department of Homeland Security to either conduct the interviews within the U.S. or abroad, but said the department had to retain \"custody and control\" over the men.",
      "A U.S. immigration official revealed in a June 4 filing that the migrants are being held in a conference room in a converted shipping container on the naval base and are guarded by 11 ICE officers. The official, Mellissa Harper, described in an affidavit the conditions facing the migrants and the immigration authorities, who she said have felt ill since arriving in Djibouti, which uses burn pits to dispose of trash and human waste.",
      "The ICE officers were unable to take anti-malaria medication for up to 72 hours before arriving in Djibouti and have experienced coughing, difficulty breathing, fever and achy joints, Harper said. They were also warned by defense officials that they were in \"imminent danger\" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen and ICE officers do not have body armor or other gear to put on in case of an attack, she said.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court last month to pause Murphy's injunction, which Solicitor General D. John Sauer said was thwarting the administration's attempts to deport what it describes as the \"worst of the worst illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process,\" he wrote in a filing. \"In addition to usurping the executive's authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.\"",
      "He said Murphy's injunction created a \"diplomatic and logistical morass.\"",
      "But lawyers for the migrants at risk of deportation to third countries said the criteria laid out in the lower court's injunction are mandated by federal law and regulations, U.S. treaty obligations and the Constitution.",
      "The order, they said, \"simply requires defendants to comply with the law when carrying them out.\"",
      "The immigration lawyers said over the past weeks, the Trump administration \"repeatedly sought to remove people as a punitive measure, to some of the most dangerous places on the planet, and with only hours' notice.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping immigration crackdown since he returned to the White House for a second term. The president's administration has since moved to end a Temporary Protected Status program that shielded 350,000 Venezuelan migrants from the threat of deportation and to revoke the legal status of roughly 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Supreme Court has allowed him to move forward with terminating both of those programs while legal proceedings continue.",
      "Mr. Trump also has sought to use the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans who his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, though several courts have ruled that the president cannot use the law to detain or remove certain migrants.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 11:36:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is testifying before Congress this week, said tariffs are \"likely to push up prices.\"",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his view that the central bank should keep interest rates steady for now, citing inflation risks from U.S. tariffs.",
      "Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony\u00a0Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump\u00a0to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December.",
      "In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation \"could be short lived\" or \"could instead be more persistent.\" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates.\u00a0But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said in the testimony.",
      "He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become \"an ongoing inflation problem.\"",
      "Powell is \"unbending under pressure,\" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. \"Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations.\"",
      "Fed officials push for cut",
      "Two Fed officials \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller \u2014 have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30.",
      "On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise.",
      "\"It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,\" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. \"Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting.\"",
      "Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize.",
      "\"The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,\" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, \"We will get to a place where we cut rates.\"",
      "At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows.",
      "\"Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note. \"The most likely next date for a cut is 9/17 or 10/29.\"",

      "Though Democrats are currently in the minority, as the new ranking member, Garcia would be in line to chair the Oversight Committee if Democrats retake the House in 2026, halfway through President Trump's second term. During Mr. Trump's first term, the committee led numerous investigations into the Trump administration after Democrats won the House in 2018.",
      "Connolly's death\u00a0came weeks after the Virginia Democrat announced that he would not seek reelection in 2026 and would be\u00a0stepping back\u00a0from his post as the top Democrat on the committee because his cancer had returned. He was 75 years old.",
      "Connolly had been elected to the top committee post months earlier, as the committee's members rejected a push by some to tap a younger generation of lawmakers to lead the party on top panels. Connolly defeated 35-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to become the ranking member of the powerful committee.",
      "Oversight Committee Democrats vied for the ranking member post after Connolly announced his departure from the role. And though Ocasio-Cortez opted not to seek the post, having left the committee months earlier, the contest quickly became crowded.",

      "The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.",
      "The \"roadless rule\" adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "The rule impeded road construction and \"responsible timber production\" that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.",
      "\"This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation's forests,\" Rollins said.",
      "Scientists say worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has enabled fuels to build up.",

      "State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.",
      "Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab.",
      "Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands.",
      "Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new \"era of abundance\" on public lands under President Trump's administration in the development of natural resources, including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.",
      "Immediate opposition appears",
      "Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting \"not for sale\" and carrying signs that read, \"This land belongs to you and me\" and \"keep our public land free for future generations.\"",
      "On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas \"another example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.\"",

      "Update: This story was published before President Trump, on Tuesday morning, accused both Israel and Iran of violating the ceasefire he had announced just hours earlier. Then, after speaking with Israel's prime minister, Mr. Trump said Israel would not continue attacking Iran and declared, \"the Ceasefire is in effect.\"\u00a0Read more here.",
      "Israel and Iran said Tuesday they are complying with a ceasefire agreement announced by President Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said on Truth Social just after 1 a.m. ET Tuesday that a ceasefire he announced earlier between the two countries \"IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!\"",
      "The Israeli government announced that, \"In light of achieving the objectives of the operation, and in full coordination with President Trump, Israel has agreed to the president's proposal for a bilateral ceasefire. Israel will respond forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire.\"",
      "At about the same time, Iranian state television said the ceasefire had begun.",
      "Mr. Trump posted Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed on a \"Complete and Total CEASEFIRE\", a move he said would end the more than weeklong conflict between the two countries.",
      "The ceasefire was to take hold in stages, the president said.",
      "Under the ceasefire announced by Mr. Trump Monday evening, Iran was to stop striking Israel in six hours (at midnight ET on Tuesday), and Israel was to stop striking Iran 12 hours after that (at noon ET Tuesday). Then, after another 12 hours, or at midnight ET Wednesday, the war would be considered over, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces had reported a series of missile barrages from Iran both before and after Mr. Trump's midnight deadline for Iran to halt the strikes. Israel did not specify when the missiles were launched, and it's unclear whether the latest missile strikes violated the terms laid out by Mr. Trump.",
      "Hours after Mr. Trump's initial post, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested on X that Iran had stopped its strikes on Israel at 4 a.m. Tehran time (8:30 p.m. ET Monday). Iran's military operations \"continued until the very last minute,\" he wrote.",
      "But Araghchi also wrote that \"there is NO 'agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations,\" though he added that Iran didn't plan to continue strikes on Israel if Israel also ceased strikes at the same time. The timeline laid out by Mr. Trump called for Israel to stop striking about 15 hours after the time specified by Araghchi.",
      "\"The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later,\" Araghchi wrote.",
      "In another Truth Social post later Monday night, following the Iranian foreign minister's comments, Mr. Trump wrote, in part, that Israel and Iran \"came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, 'PEACE!' I knew the time was NOW.\"",
      "Prior to Araghchi's comments, a senior White House official told CBS News both sides had agreed to a ceasefire, with Israel agreeing as long as there are no further Iranian strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump communicated directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while several other administration officials \u2014 Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff \u2014 communicated with Iran through direct and indirect channels, the White House official said.",
      "Qatar helped broker a deal, another White House official said. Mr. Trump had asked the Qatari Emir to get Iran to agree to a ceasefire. Vance coordinated with the Qatari prime minister on details, and Iran agreed to the ceasefire after speaking to the prime minister. The official said the direct talks with Iran occurred after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base.",
      "The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13 with Israel launching airstrikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes \u2014 which killed several top Iranian military officials \u2014 prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel.",
      "As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran\u00a0said in a statement. The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information.",
      "Iran's attacks have killed at least 24 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Iran called its response \"devastating and powerful,\" but Mr. Trump called it \"very weak.\" The president said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\"",
      "Dispute over Iran's nuclear program still lingers",
      "It's not clear how the ceasefire announcement will impact a broader dispute over the fate of Iran's nuclear program.",
      "Israel's campaign was primarily aimed at Iran's nuclear program, as the country's stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium has grown rapidly in recent months, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "Israel has alleged Iran was secretly \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\" But earlier this year, U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Iran was not making nuclear weapons, though \"pressure has probably built\" for Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to reauthorize the country's nuclear weapons program.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week he believed the intelligence community was \"wrong\" about Iran's nuclear ambitions, telling reporters, \"I think they were very close to having one.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the issue \"irrelevant\" in an interview Sunday\u00a0on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" saying Iranian officials \"have everything they need to build the weapon.\"",
      "Iran has long insisted its uranium enrichment program is peaceful.",
      "For weeks, Mr. Trump has sought a broader deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program, but even before Israel began striking Iran, administration officials had grown frustrated with what they viewed as Iran's unwillingness to actually negotiate, a U.S. official told CBS News. Mr. Trump has suggested Iran should abandon all uranium enrichment, but Iran rejected that demand.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Florida officials asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow the state to enforce a new immigration law that makes it a crime for people in the United States unlawfully to enter Florida.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the high court, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier asked the justices to put on hold a federal judge's decision preventing law enforcement officers from enforcing the new law, known as SB 4-C. The judge, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams, ruled that the measure is likely unconstitutional.",
      "A federal appeals court in Atlanta declined to halt Williams' order and is allowing the law to take effect while legal proceedings continue.",
      "\"Florida is enjoined from enforcing its statute to the detriment of Florida's citizens and the state's sovereign prerogative to protect them from harm,\" Uthmeier wrote in his request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court. \"Illegal immigration continues to wreak havoc in the state while that law cannot be enforced. And without this court's intervention, Florida and its citizens will remain disabled from combatting the serious harms of illegal immigration for years as this litigation proceeds through the lower courts.\"",
      "Williams had initially issued a temporary restraining order that prohibited enforcement of the immigration law and ordered the attorney general to notify all law enforcement agencies in the state of her injunction. Uthmeier circulated a letter to those agencies in April informing them that officers and agents should comply with Williams' directives. But in a follow-up letter, the attorney general told the law enforcement community that \"no judicial order \u2026 properly restrains you from\" enforcing the law, and that \"no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforce\" it.",
      "In response to the letters, Williams found Uthmeier in civil contempt earlier this month.",
      "\"Litigants cannot change the plain meaning of words as it suits them, especially when conveying a court's clear and unambiguous order,\" she wrote. \"Fidelity to the rule of law can have no other meaning.\"",
      "The judge ordered Uthmeier to file biweekly reports about whether any arrests, detentions or other law enforcement actions were made under Florida's law.",
      "The state's immigration law was passed earlier this year and makes it a crime for people living in the U.S. illegally to \"knowingly enter or re-enter Florida after coming into the country by \"eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.\" State officials have said the measure aims to help the Trump administration curb illegal immigration and tracks federal immigration law.",
      "Two migrants who are living unlawfully in Florida, the Florida Immigrant Coalition and the Farmworker Association of Florida sued the attorney general and 20 state attorneys over the law, arguing that it is preempted by federal law and a violation of the Constitution.",
      "Uthmeier defended the law in filings with the Supreme Court, writing that state lawmakers approved the measure in response to \"devastating harms killing Florida's citizens and destroying their communities.\" He said the law was a \"measured effort\" by the state to protect its sovereignty and falls within Florida's law enforcement responsibilities.",

      "The president did not specify how much early warning Iran gave or how the warning was delivered. But Mr. Trump's message seemed to confirm speculation that Iran could telegraph its plans for retaliation in advance, giving the United States a chance to minimize the damage and avoid an escalation.",
      "Hours after the Qatar strikes on Monday, Mr. Trump announced Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire starting at midnight ET, less than two weeks after Israel began striking Iranian targets and Iran responded with missiles. Neither Israel nor Iran has commented on a ceasefire.",
      "Diplomatic sources told CBS News that Monday's counterattack from Iran was expected and calibrated, and U.S. and Qatari officials met over the weekend to prepare.",
      "The move to give advance notice echoes Iran's 2020 strikes on a U.S. military base in Iraq in retaliation for the Trump-ordered killing of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps head Qassem Soleimani. Iraq's prime minister at the time said Iran gave him advance notice of the strikes, which did not kill any American service members, though more than 100 were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries following the strikes, the Pentagon said at the time.",
      "Mr. Trump said Monday's strikes caused very little damage. Most of the missiles fired at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar were shot down \"and hardly any damage was done,\" the president wrote, describing the attack as \"very weak\" and \"expected.\" He said no Americans or Qataris were killed or wounded in the attack on Al Udeid, which houses thousands of U.S. troops.",

      "The dramatic explosion of a SpaceX Starship upper stage rocket during a test at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf coast late Wednesday may have been triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Thursday.",
      "The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption.",
      "The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV.",
      "But the company said there is \"no commonality\" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship.",
      "\"Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,\" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. \"If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design.\"",
      "The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week.",
      "Such \"hotfire\" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th \"integrated flight test.\"",
      "But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing.",
      "The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast.",
      "The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plastic-bag-bans-fees-curbs-litter-study-says/",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers conducted the first systematic review of policies around the U.S. to limit plastic bag use.",
    "story": [
      "State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines \u2014 potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found.",
      "More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes \u2013 and if they did, to what extent.",
      "Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations.",
      "\"When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,\" Oremus said in a statement. \"And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy.\"",
      "These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments. Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy.",
      "Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according\u00a0to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own.",
      "Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed \"single use\" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered \"reusable\" under partial bans, \"there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use.\"",
      "In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide \"preemption\" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all.",
      "During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said.",
      "\"Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting\u2014but not eliminating\u2014shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,\" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.",

    "story": [
      "Peggy Whitson, America's most experienced astronaut, is leading an international crew of first-time fliers from India, Poland and Hungary on a privately-financed flight to the International Space Station \u2014 the fourth non-government mission mounted by Houston-based Axiom Space.",
      "Strapped into a new, as-yet-unnamed SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, the crew is expected to blast off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at\u00a0 2:31 a.m. EDT Wednesday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the rocket into the plane of the space station's orbit \u2014 a requirement for rendezvous missions.",
      "Whitson's crewmates are test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski of Poland, and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu. All three are making their first space flight.",
      "The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA flights to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit.",
      "The Falcon 9 first stage booster, B1094, will be making its second flight. After propelling the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage will attempt a return-to-launch-site landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. To date, SpaceX has pulled off 466 successful first stage landings, 63 of them in Florida.",
      "Launch originally was planned for June 11, but the flight was held up by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It then was delayed by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module.",
      "The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port.",
      "NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it. But sources said the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the PrK compartment more that usual, ensuring the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station results in a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the leaky PrK.",
      "That minimizes, if not eliminates, any chance the air supply in the station's other modules could be affected if the leak suddenly worsened.",
      "Plans for the Ax-4 mission",
      "Assuming an on-time liftoff, Whitson, Shukla, Uzna\u0144ski and Kapu will dock at the space-facing port of the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday.",
      "They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim.",
      "Whitson, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry, retired from NASA in 2018 and now works for Axiom. She ranks ninth in the world for time in space, No. 1 in the world among female astronauts and No. 1 overall among U.S. astronauts.",
      "Going into the Ax-4 flight, Whitson had logged 675 days in space across three NASA flights and one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space.",
      "As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker \u2014 seventh in the world overall \u2014 with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station.",
      "\"I think I'm somewhat addicted to space,\" she said in an interview with CBS News. \"I really like being there, and it's just exhilarating living in an environment so different than what we have here on Earth. And having adapted to that environment, it is fun for me to share my experience with the rookie flyers that are going with me.",
      "\"I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,\" she added.",
      "Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying \"we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for.\"",
      "The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three \"private astronaut missions,\" or PAMs, a formal designation by NASA for commercial research flights to the International Space Station.",
      "Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab.",
      "\"We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,\" Whitson said. \"The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station.",
      "\"Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well.\"",
      "All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations. Whitson said the mission \"opens up access to countries that might not normally get access to space. So this is very exciting.\"",

      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",
      "The authors' attorneys declined comment.",
      "Other AI companies have also come under fire over the material they use to build their language learning models. The New York Times, for example, sued Open AI and Microsoft in 2023, claiming that the tech companies used millions of its articles to train their automated chatbots.",
      "At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 20:25:54 -0400",
    "summary": "ICE officers detained the wife of a Marine Corps veteran in Louisiana during a routine immigration appointment.",
    "story": [
      "After U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre's wife last month, he doesn't know how to tell his children where their mother went.",
      "When his nearly 2-year-old son Noah asks for his mother before bed, Clouatre just tells him, \"Mama will be back soon.\" When his 3-month-old, breastfeeding daughter Lyn is hungry, he gives her a bottle of baby formula instead. He's worried how his newborn will bond with her mother absent skin-to-skin contact.",
      "His wife, Paola, is one of tens of thousands of people in custody and facing deportation as the Trump administration pushes for immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day. Earlier this month, arrests by ICE during President Trump's second term topped 100,000, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"They knew I was veteran, they just ripped her away from me and her children, from her breastfeeding, you know, newborn daughter, it's almost inhumane,\" Adrian Clouatre told CBS News.",
      "Even as Marine Corps recruiters promote enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status, directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families, immigration law experts say. The federal agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation, government memos show.",
      "To visit his wife, Adrian Clouatre has to make an eight-hour round trip from their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to a rural ICE detention center in Monroe. Clouatre, who qualifies as a service-disabled veteran, goes every chance he can get.",
      "Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old Mexican national whose mother brought her into the country seeking asylum more than a decade ago, met Adrian Clouatre, 26, at a Southern California nightclub during the final months of his five years of military service in 2022. Within a year, they had tattooed each other's names on their arms.",
      "After they married in 2024, Paola Clouatre sought a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. Adrian Clouatre said he is \"not a very political person\" but believes his wife deserved to live legally in the U.S.",
      "\"I'm all for 'get the criminals out of the country,' right?\" he said. \"But the people that are here working hard, especially the ones married to Americans \u2014 I mean, that's always been a way to secure a green card.\"",
      "Detained at a green card meeting",
      "The process to apply for Paola Clouatre's green card went smoothly at first, but eventually she learned ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing.",
      "Clouatre and her mother had been estranged for years \u2014 Clouatre cycled out of homeless shelters as a teenager \u2014 and up until a couple of months ago, Clouatre had \"no idea\" about her mother's missed hearing or the deportation order, her husband said.",
      "Adrian Clouatre recalled that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer asked about the deportation order during a May 27 appointment as part of her green card application. After Paola Clouatre explained that she was trying to reopen her case, the staffer asked her and her husband to wait in the lobby for paperwork regarding a follow-up appointment, which her husband said he believed was a \"ploy.\"",
      "Soon, officers arrived and handcuffed Paola Clouatre, who handed her wedding ring to her husband for safekeeping.",
      "Adrian Clouatre, eyes welling with tears, said he and his wife had tried to \"do the right thing\" and that he felt ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests, though he understood they were trying to do their jobs.",
      "\"It's just a hell of a way to treat a veteran,\" said Carey Holliday, a former immigration judge who is now representing the couple. \"You take their wives and send them back to Mexico?\"",
      "The Clouatres filed a motion for a California-based immigration judge to reopen the case on Paola's deportation order and are waiting to hear back, Holliday said.",
      "On June 9, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services posted to social media about Paola Clouatre's case, writing that when Clouatre \"was apprehended by @CBP and ordered removed by a judge in 2018, she chose to defy the order and stay in the U.S. 7 years later, she had another bad idea and applied for a Green Card. @ICEgov took her into custody at our New Orleans office. @DHSgov has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "However, Paola Clouatre told CBS News of the 2018 order: \"My wife was not only a minor, but homeless when that removal order was issued. Her mom skipped the appointment, my wife was living in a homeless shelter in CPS care. And there was no way for her to know about the removal order.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre also shared with CBS News Tuesday a letter he said he wrote to Mr. Trump and submitted through WhiteHouse.gov.",
      "\"I'm aware that purely by law my wife is considered an illegal immigrant,\" he wrote in the letter. \"But she is being made to pay for the sins of her mother and has been inhumanly torn from her 2 young American children and American Veteran husband. We are married and have gone through the proper channels. We found out about her removal order about a week before we went to the USCIS interview and were honest about it hoping to have time to resolve the issue.\"",
      "Jeff Migliozzi, spokesperson for the Washington, D.C.-based migrant advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants, told CBS News in a statement: \"The scheduled ICE check-in arrest, like what happened here, has been a popular tactic under this administration in order to achieve higher numbers. The practice really underscores the cruelty and injustice of this administration's immigration policy -- here you have people doing all they can to follow the rules you gave them, and then you pull the rug out from under them. The result is separated families and shattered lives. It's appalling.\"",
      "Less discretion for military families",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Paola Clouatre \"is in the country illegally\" and that the administration is \"not going to ignore the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Ignoring an Immigration Judge's order to leave the U.S. is a bad idea,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a June 9 post on social platform X which appeared to refer to Clouatre's case. The agency added that the government \"has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre said the agency's X post does not accurately reflect his wife's situation because she entered the country as a minor with her mother, seeking asylum.",
      "\"She was not aware of the removal order, so she was not knowingly defying it,\" he said. \"If she had been arrested, she would have been deported long ago, and we would never have met.\"",
      "Prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member, said Holliday and Margaret Stock, a military immigration law expert.",
      "In a Feb. 28 memo, the agency said it \"will no longer exempt\" from deportation people in groups that had received more grace in the past. This includes the families of military personnel or veterans, Stock said. As of June 12, the agency said it has referred upward of 26,000 cases to ICE for deportation.",
      "USCIS still offers a program allowing family members of military personnel who illegally entered the U.S. to remain in the country as they apply for a green card. But there no longer appears to be room for leeway, such as giving a veteran's spouse like Paola Clouatre the opportunity to halt her active deportation order without facing arrest, Stock said.",
      "But numerous Marine Corps recruiters have continued to post ads on social media, geared toward Latinos, promoting enlistment as a way to gain \"protection from deportation\" for family members.",
      "\"I think it's bad for them to be advertising that people are going to get immigration benefits when it appears that the administration is no longer offering these immigration benefits,\" Stock said. \"It sends the wrong message to the recruits.\"",
      "Marine Corps spokesperson Master Sgt. Tyler Hlavac told The Associated Press that recruiters have now been informed they are \"not the proper authority\" to \"imply that the Marine Corps can secure immigration relief for applicants or their families.\"",

    "story": [
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has issued new safety recommendations\u00a0to the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing following the 2024 incident in which a door plug flew off in the middle of an Alaska Airlines flight.",
      "\"An accident like this only happens when there are multiple system failures,\" NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said at a meeting on Tuesday, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes for the incident.",
      "Homendy led the investigation into what happened before the door panel blew out six minutes into Alaska Flight 1282 that took off from Portland on Jan. 5, 2024. The aircraft was at about 16,000 feet\u00a0over Oregon during a trip to California when it had to make an emergency landing. Four bolts meant to hold the Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug in place were missing,\u00a0the NTSB discovered after the fact.",
      "\"The safety deficiencies that led to this accident should have been evident \u2026 to Boeing and to the FAA \u2026 and were therefore preventable,\" Homendy said at the meeting Tuesday.",
      "The accident left a gaping hole in the plane that had 177 people on board; eight of them suffered minor injuries.",
      "In the NTSB's report, investigators said the incident's probable cause was in the in-flight separation of the left mid exit door plug, blaming \"Boeing's failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight necessary to ensure that manufacturing personnel could consistently and correctly comply with its parts removal process, which was intended to document and ensure that 4 the securing bolts and hardware that were removed to facilitate rework during the manufacturing process were properly reinstalled.\"",
      "Investigators also faulted the FAA for the agency's oversight.",
      "\"Contributing to the accident was the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement surveillance and audit planning activities, which failed to adequately identify and ensure that Boeing addressed the repetitive and systemic nonconformance issues associated with its parts removal process,\" the report said.",
      "In a statement, the FAA said it is taking the NTSB's safety recommendations seriously and will carefully evaluate the ones issued Tuesday.",
      "\"The FAA has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the Alaska Airlines door-plug accident and we will continue this aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues,\" the FAA's statement said. \"We are actively monitoring Boeing's performance and meet weekly with the company to review its progress and any challenges it's facing in implementing necessary changes.\"",
      "The FAA also said its safety inspectors are in Boeing's facilities conducting more targeted audits and inspections. However, the agency said it has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap it has placed on Boeing until the FAA can confidently say Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft.",
      "\"We at Boeing regret this accident and continue to work on strengthening safety and quality across our operations. We will review the final report and recommendations as we continue to implement improvements,\" a spokesperson for Boeing said Tuesday following the NTSB meeting.",
      "When the 737 Max involved in the accident was being manufactured, Boeing removed the door panel to make repairs to rivets nearby, according to the NTSB's report. Paperwork that would have triggered additional inspections was never created and the panel was reinstalled without its bolts \u2014 and the team that did the work had never opened that type of door panel.",
      "When asked whether all of it can be blamed on human error on the manufacturing floor at Boeing, Homendy told CBS News there needed to be a design change or a better process.",
      "\"It is due to a process issue, a process failure. A lot of people have focused on one or two Boeing personnel or door plug personnel. I think we have to really step back and look at the entire process was reliant on humans to set to put in a record that the door needed to be removed and put back in place,\" she said.",
      "Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later.",
      "\"All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,\" she recalled. \"As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Brewer is among a group of 35 passengers who have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines in King County, Washington, where Boeing is headquartered. The companies have previously declined to comment on other lawsuits over the incident.",
      "\"The NTSB confirmed what we already suspected \u2013 Boeing's quality control was woefully sloppy, and the FAA failed as a watchdog,\" Brewer's lawyer, Mark Lindquist, told CBS News in a statement. \"Now it's time for Boeing to accept responsibility, fix their issues, and move forward. We all want to feel safe when we board a Boeing plane.\"",
      "Despite the failure, Homendy said she feels like Boeing airplanes are safe, adding that she has \"no concerns\" about that. However, she said there are ways to improve safety.",
      "\"We found that in our investigation and we hope to help them close any gaps that remain,\" Homendy said.",
      "The NTSB's new safety recommendations to the FAA include:",

    "story": [
      "Last September, the U.S. Postal Service debuted its long-awaited \u2014 and much litigated \u2014 electric vehicle mail delivery truck. Since then, more than 7,200 new zero-emissions vehicles have been distributed to the Postal Service.",
      "But a provision tucked inside the Senate Republican bill to enact President Trump's second-term agenda would force the USPS to sell off the brand new trucks and cancel or significantly amend the contract for the remaining 58,800 that are due to be delivered over the next 10 years.",
      "According to the text of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs portion of the bill released by Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul, chair of the committee, all electric vehicles and related infrastructure owned by the Postal Service will be sold and the proceeds will \"be deposited into the general fund of the treasury.\" Selling the EVs would \"cut unnecessary costs and focus USPS on delivering mail and not achieving the environmental initiatives pushed by the Biden Administration,\" according to the bill.",
      "Paul's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Peter Pastre, the vice president of government relations and public policy for USPS, wrote a letter to the Senate in June that said the provision to sell the EVs would \"make major and damaging changes to the U.S. Postal Service's vehicle fleet program, potentially impacting our ability to deliver to millions of Americans.\"",
      "The bill is being considered under budget reconciliation rules, which means that Republicans can pass it with a simple majority, instead of meeting the 60-vote threshold that is required to consider most Senate legislation. In order to use this approach, every item in the bill must have a budgetary impact, and the Senate parliamentarian determines whether each provision meets that standard, known as the Byrd Rule.",
      "Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough found that disposing of the USPS EVs is one of several of the bill's provisions violating the Byrd Rule, according to Senate Democrats.",
      "\"Scrapping USPS' electric vehicles is a lose-lose scenario,\" Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, ranking member of the Budget Committee, told CBS News in a statement. \"We move backwards on clean energy and have to spend even more money to replace the vehicles.\"",
      "Republicans, who would like to revoke the EVs and their related infrastructure, say this provision could potentially raise money by rescinding $1 billion allocated in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act to purchase the vehicles. But according to Pastre, it would cost more than $450 million to replace the 7,200 revoked vehicles, and the USPS has already spent more than $540 million on electrical upgrades for infrastructure to support the cars.",
      "Because the majority of the vehicles are specially designed for the Postal Service \u2014 like right-side driving for mail delivery trucks \u2014 and most of the electrical infrastructure is buried under ground, the potential for raising money at auction is \"negligible,\" according to Pastre.",
      "Pastre was direct about the harm this action would cause the Postal Service saying, \"it will seriously cripple our ability to replace an aging and obsolete delivery fleet.\"",
      "\"The Postal Service has over 200,000 vehicles in an outdated and aging fleet. Using EVs will reduce fuel and maintenance costs and help the USPS to better serve the public,\" Mark Dimondstein, president of American Postal Workers Union, said in an email to CBS News. \"Eliminating energy-efficient vehicles would be a step backward and not be in the best interest of those we serve and the communities where we live.\"",
      "Since 2015, the USPS has been looking to update and modernize its fleet of more than 200,000 vehicles. The majority of the trucks were 25 years old or more, often lacked proper heating and cooling and in some cases, would spontaneously combust in neighborhoods as workers operated the aging vehicles.",
      "When the Postal Service first announced its proposal in 2021 to replace 165,000 vehicles, it originally intended to purchase traditional gas vehicles to replace 90% of the fleet. But the gas-powered mail trucks had low fuel efficiency, guzzling fuel at under a 9-m.p.g. rate, according to filings by several environmental organizations and more than a dozen states that sued to block the plan.",
      "\"It's important that EVs be part of the mix for the USPS because it should represent the next generation,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the organizations that sued the USPS in 2021. \"The last generation of vehicles are literally dying on its wheels.\"",
      "The legal action forced the USPS to reconsider its plan, and it finalized a deal in late 2022 to purchase 106,000 new cars \u2014 and 66,000 were to be zero-emissions vehicles. It also planned to install more than 14,000 chargers to keep the fleet running. The cost to update the fleet totaled $9.6 billion, and the Biden administration allocated $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act to help cover the costs, with the rest financed by the Postal Service.",
      "\"My bet is this will survive another day,\" said Becker, given that the parliamentarian has ruled it should be stricken and it would be difficult to get 60 votes in the Senate to keep it in the bill. But Congress recently voted to revoke California's EPA waivers to enact its EV mandate under the Congressional Review Act, which the parliamentarian said was illegal. It remains to be seen if Republicans will follow her recommendations.",
      "\"Selling them off at a discount just so you don't have to say you don't have EVs for political reasons makes no sense,\" said Becker.",

      "The 32-year-old from Seattle was found unresponsive at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, according to a statement from the Bureau of Prisons. Responding employees initiated life-saving measures, and emergency medical services transported Park to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead, the bureau said.",

      "Park, a U.S. citizen, had arrived at the L.A. detention center on June 13, after he was indicted for alleged malicious destruction of property. He was apprehended in Poland earlier this month after flying to Warsaw a few days after the bombing outside American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic on May 17.",
      "He was accused of shipping approximately 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate \u2014 commonly used as a precursor to construct homemade explosives \u2014 to the bomber, who was identified by officials as 25-year-old Guy Bartkus. Bartkus died in the blast outside the fertility clinic.",

    "summary": "Former DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni says he was fired after pushing back on orders from top officials, including Emil Bove, to defy court rulings.",
    "story": [
      "An ousted Justice Department attorney told Congress that senior department officials, including a former acting deputy attorney general, discussed defying federal court orders and withholding information from judges to advance the Trump administration's immigration priorities, according to a whistleblower complaint filed Tuesday.",
      "The attorney, Erez Reuveni, a veteran of over 14 years at the department who had been praised and promoted for his service, was put on leave and then fired earlier this year after his attorneys say he pushed back against three different Justice Department attempts to \"defy\" immigration-related court orders \"through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation.\"",
      "While Reuveni has not spoken publicly about his departure, a whistleblower report sent to senior congressional leadership by his attorneys details how he says he was \"threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged\" in his final weeks in the department after he questioned instructions from top Justice Department officials to ignore court orders and misrepresent facts in court in three separate, high-profile standoffs between the department and federal judges over immigration cases. Among those officials was the No. 3 Justice Department official, Emil Bove.",
      "Bove nominated in May by President Trump to sit on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and is scheduled to appear for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Before his stint as a top Justice Department official, Bove represented Mr. Trump in his criminal trial in Manhattan last year.",
      "Reuveni's attorneys described in his complaint a meeting with Justice Department officials about contesting possible court orders blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He alleged that Bove, who at the time was principal assistant deputy attorney general, said that the department \"would need to consider telling the courts 'f*** you' and ignore any such court order,\" and that the deportation \"planes needed to take off no matter what.\"",
      "\"Mr. Reuveni was in disbelief,\" his attorneys wrote, adding that others in the room were \"stunned\" by the suggestion that the Justice Department would tell its clients in the government to disobey court rulings against the administration.",
      "A day after the meeting, the complaint said, a Washington, D.C., federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador and ordered planes carrying the men to return back to the U.S. The Trump administration did not reroute the flights.",
      "Reuveni also said that Drew Ensign, one of his supervisors, knowingly told a judge that he didn't know if more Alien Enemies Act removals were underway \u2014 even though Ensign was present for the Justice Department meeting when Bove told his team the deportations would continue.",
      "After repeatedly voicing concerns in phone calls and emails that the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department had violated the court's orders by not returning the migrants, Reuveni said he received a phone call from a DHS attorney telling him to \"consult DOJ leadership if he had any questions\" about the decision.",
      "In a separate incident days later, Reuveni's attorneys allege that he was \"told to stop asking questions\" by senior Justice Department leaders after he attempted \"to ascertain whether DOJ had violated a court order\" in Massachusetts that blocked the removal of migrants to third-party countries with no due process, after he saw evidence that the removals were still underway.",
      "The complaint says that Yakov Roth, an assistant attorney general, called Reuveni to tell him that \"Bove was very unhappy\" that he was looking into why the removals had continued, in spite of a nationwide injunction blocking them.",
      "And in April, Reuveni unsuccessfully argued in defense of the controversial and mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, admitting in court that the man \"should not have been removed\" from the U.S. to El Salvador.",
      "In the days leading up to an initial hearing in Abrego Garcia's case, Reuveni's attorneys say he \"repeatedly and consistently requested updates on efforts to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. and assurances of his safety,\" in the Salvadoran supermax prison where he was being detained.",
      "Those efforts were stonewalled, the attorneys say, after Reuveni was told by his bosses to \"stop asking for facts supporting any possible defense of the case,\" despite raising \"concerns in multiple emails to both DHS and DOS about the sufficiency of the evidence to support Mr. Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation and the lack of action to correct his erroneous removal.\"",
      "After Reuveni conceded in court that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed, a Maryland judge ordered him to be returned to the United States. As a result, a supervisor told Reuveni that the White House had questions as to why he didn't argue that Abrego Garcia was an alleged gang member and that the removal was justified, despite a court order to the contrary.",
      "Hours later, department leadership asked Reuveni to sign an appeal brief of the Maryland judge's order.\u00a0 He says he refused, telling a supervisor that he \"didn't sign up to lie.\"",
      "Reuveni was placed on administrative leave shortly afterwards for, according to a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, \"failure to follow a directive from your superiors; failure to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States; and engaging in conduct prejudicial to your client.\"",
      "After the news that Reuveni had been put on leave became public, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement to CBS News that \"every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\"",
      "Less than a week later, Reuveni was fired.",
      "Reuveni's attorneys said that the consequences of the Justice Department actions alleged by Reuveni \"have grave impacts not only for the safety of individuals removed from the country in violation of court orders, but also for the constitutional rights and protections of all persons \u2013 citizen and noncitizen alike \u2013 who are potential victims of flagrant, deliberate disregard of due process and the rule of law by the agency charged with upholding it.\"",
      "The whistleblower account was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "In a post on X following the article's publication, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Reuveni's account contains \"falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee,\" and said he was in the meeting where Bove allegedly said he would not follow court orders. Blanche said that \"at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed.\"",
      "The Justice Department also defended Bove's handling of the deportation cases.",
      "\"Having entered office with a mandate to end the invasion of illegal alien criminals, Emil Bove has been a relentless advocate for the enforcement of our immigration laws and the removal of violent killers, terrorist gang leaders, and child predators, all of whom should never have been allowed to invade our borders, which is why Emil will be an outstanding federal judge to keep our country safe and uphold the rights of all Americans,\" the department said in a statement.",
      "A statement by Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Reuveni's claims \"not only speak to Mr. Bove's failure to fulfill his ethical obligations as a lawyer, but demonstrate that his activities are part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his allies to undermine the Justice Department's commitment to the rule of law.\"",

      "It comes after the FBI has received multiple internal complaints from employees about being pulled off counterterrorism and counterintelligence tasks to focus on immigration enforcement, according to two other sources who spoke to CBS News.

      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Monday the federal government will fund an effort by Florida to set up immigration detention centers, which include a proposed site in the Everglades that state officials have dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"",
      "Noem said the detention facilities in Florida will be funded \"in large part\" by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's shelter and services program, an initiative created by Congress to support groups and cities receiving migrants and asylum-seekers released from federal custody along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Primarily charged with overseeing disaster relief efforts, FEMA is an agency within the Department of Homeland Security that has faced significant cuts under the second Trump administration.",
      "\"Under President Trump's leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens,\" Noem said in a statement to CBS News. \"We will expand facilities and bed space in just days, thanks to our partnership with Florida.\"",
      "Officials in Tallahassee first announced plans to help the federal government expand its capacity to hold detainees awaiting deportation last week.",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said a largely abandoned airfield in the Everglades would be repurposed as a detention facility to house immigrants living in the U.S. illegally with criminal records. He dubbed it \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" saying any detainees seeking to escape would face alligators and pythons in the treacherous wetlands surrounding the site.",
      "On Monday, Uthmeier announced the federal government had \"approved\" the state's plan to build \"Alligator Alcatraz\" and other facilities that he said could collectively house as many as 5,000 detainees. He said the facilities could start receiving detainees early next month, calling them temporary.",
      "\"There's really nowhere to go. If you're housed there, if you're detained there, there's no way in, no way out,\" Uthmeier said in an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson, describing the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" facility.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congressional Republicans are racing to meet a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline to send a massive tax and domestic policy bill to President Trump as he dials up pressure on lawmakers, even as several major disputes have yet to be resolved.",
      "On his way to The Hague on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called on lawmakers to stay in Washington until they can resolve their issues and get the bill \u2014 which extends the president's 2017 tax cuts and includes much of his second-term agenda \u2014 to his desk.",
      "\"NO ONE GOES ON VACATION UNTIL IT'S DONE,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The last scheduled day in session for both chambers before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving them with little time to reach their goal.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who met with Senate Republicans Tuesday, told reporters after the meeting that they're \"on track\" for a vote Friday on the bill, adding that he expects it can get to the president's desk by July 4.",
      "Still, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, threatened to keep senators in Washington over the recess as several Republicans cast doubt about the upper chamber's ability to finish their work before the deadline.",
      "Thune told reporters Monday that the Senate is \"on schedule\" to vote by the end of the week.",
      "The bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u00a0narrowly passed the House last month, but Senate Republicans are making changes in order to navigate the party's tight 53-47 margin in the upper chamber.",
      "On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he told House Republicans to \"keep your schedules flexible\" as the Senate looks to send the legislation back to the lower chamber for approval. The Louisiana Republican predicted the Senate could pass the bill by Friday or Saturday. The timing of a House vote would eat into next week's recess.",
      "\"There's nothing more important that we should be involved in and can be involved in than getting the one big, beautiful bill to the president's desk,\" Johnson said at his weekly news conference.",
      "Parliamentarian rulings",
      "Days before an expected vote, the Senate's final version has yet to come together. The Senate's rulekeeper has been looking through the legislation to determine whether any provisions violate the upper chamber's rules.",
      "The Senate parliamentarian advised that several controversial provisions would violate the Byrd Rule, which requires that the legislation only include provisions that have a direct impact on federal spending, according to Senate Budget Committee Democrats.",
      "Provisions that did not make the cut are subject to a 60-vote threshold, compared with the 51 votes needed under the reconciliation process.",
      "Republicans can't include language that would make it harder to challenge the government's actions in court. The provision limited the ability of federal courts to delay or halt the government's policies by requiring people suing the federal government to post a bond to cover the potential costs and damages incurred by the government.",
      "The parliamentarian determined that a provision to bar immigrants who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents from receiving food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, should also be removed.",
      "The parliamentarian also rejected a proposal championed by Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah that would have sold off millions of acres of public lands.",
      "Other provisions struck from the bill include the sale of electric vehicles used by the United States Postal Service and several immigration-related measures, including limiting certain funding for \"sanctuary cities\" and allowing states to conduct border security and immigration enforcement.",
      "But the parliamentarian did allow Republicans to keep a 10-year moratorium on state laws regulating artificial intelligence.",
      "SALT sticking points",
      "As the Senate lurches toward a vote on the bill, disagreement over the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, has persisted. But Bessent said Tuesday afternoon that he expected a solution on what's become one of the biggest sticking points will be reached in the next 24 to 48 hours.",
      "While the House measure increases the deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, the Senate Finance Committee's version that was unveiled last week proposes permanently extending the $10,000 cap. The chasm sparked pushback among blue-state House Republicans, who have threatened to withhold their support should the Senate approve the changes and send it back to the House.",
      "Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, who formerly served in the House and has worked as a messenger between the two chambers, told reporters Monday that \"neither side is going to love where we're at, but it's going to be acceptable.\"",
      "\"The Senate wants to go further to the right and the SALT caucus wants to go further to the left,\" Mullin said. \"We're going to find, I think, hopefully some place right in the middle that both sides can live with.\"",
      "Medicaid and the provider tax",
      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding by lowering provider taxes \u2014 which states use to help fund their share of Medicaid costs \u2014 from 6% to 3.5% by 2031, after the House sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes. But the move has sparked pushback, and threatened to complicate the delicate balance reached in the House.",
      "A group of 16 House Republicans penned a letter to Thune and Johnson Tuesday opposing the Senate's changes to the House-passed legislation on Medicaid. The moderates argued that the House approach \"reflects a more pragmatic and compassionate standard,\" pointing in particular to the provisions restricting the provider tax within the Senate legislation.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, has voiced opposition to the provider tax changes, and said more senators spoke up at Tuesday's lunch against the Senate's provider tax proposal.",
      "Fiscal hawks speak out",
      "Another faction in Congress has voiced opposition to the spending levels in the legislation, advocating for deeper cuts that have often worked counter to leadership's efforts to appease other members of their conferences.",
      "Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who initially threatened to withhold their support for the House-passed legislation have suggested they would tank the Senate's changes to the bill. And a number of Senate Republicans have voiced strong opposition to the legislation's impact on the deficit.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott of Florida was among a handful of Senate Republicans who met with Mr. Trump on Monday amid opposition from fiscal hawks. Despite the disagreements, he told reporters that \"I'm the eternal optimist that we're going to figure this out.\"",

    "story": [
      "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are set to tie the knot in Italy this week, even as local frustrations mount over the multi-million dollar event.",
      "Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background.",
      "Where and when is the wedding?",
      "Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location.",
      "The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019. Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019.",
      "The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore,\u00a0according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s.",
      "A protest group called \"No Space for Bezos\" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century\u00a0Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported.",
      "How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost?",
      "The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail.",
      "About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking.",
      "Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion)",
      "Who is attending?",
      "Bezos and Sanchez invited about 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests said to include\u00a0Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump.",
      "According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport.",
      "Who is Lauren Sanchez?",
      "Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023.",
      "Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight, which included \"CBS Mornings\" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the\u00a0idea for a female-led flight to Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021.",
      "Sanchez's bachelorette party in Paris last month included Perry, Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Eva Longoria, according to AFP.",
      "What are the wedding protests about?",
      "Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs.",
      "This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice\u00a0and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates.",
      "Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups.",
      "Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: \"IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX.\" Local police folded up the banner and took it away.",
      "Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated. In March, the city issued a statement denying reports that there would be any major disruption to daily Venetian life, even with hundreds expected to descend on the city this week for the wedding.",
      "Venice and the surrounding metropolitan area has a population of roughly 250,000, according to Statista. But fewer than 50,000 people live in the city's historic district, which is composed over 100 islands connected by Venice's famous canals and footbridges.",

      "Several hours after the ceasefire was to take effect, Mr. Trump told reporters as he left for the summit that both Israel and Iran had violated it. Then, after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president said Israel would not bomb Iran again, and that \"the ceasefire is in effect.\"",
      "The president hoped to secure during the summit a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense. But a day before he was to arrive, the alliance had already agreed to the boost in defense spending, according to Matthew Whitaker, U.S. ambassador to NATO. He told reporters in a briefing Monday that as a result of Mr. Trump's leadership, NATO was \"on track\" to make that \"historic commitment\" of 5%.",
      "During the flight to the Netherlands, Mr. Trump posted an effusive note from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulating him on his actions in Iran and on the new NATO defense spending levels.",
      "\"[T]hank you for your decisive action in Iran,\" Rutte wrote. He called it \"truly extraordinary\" and said it was \"something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer.\"",
      "And of the new spending, Rutte said, \"It was not easy, but we've got them all signed onto 5 percent!\" He called it an \"important moment for America and Europe,\" and told him, \"You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.\" A NATO spokesperson confirmed that Rutte had written the text to Mr. Trump.",
      "The U.S. spent roughly 3.4% of GDP on defense in 2023, but the president has said he thinks the U.S. should not have the same 5% target.",
      "\"We've been supporting NATO so long, in many cases, I believe, paying almost 100% of the cost,\" he told reporters Friday. \"So, I don't think we should, but I think that the NATO countries should, absolutely.\"",
      "There is no clear timeline for the 5% commitment, however, and reaching that threshold could extend into the 2030s for some NATO countries, fueling criticism that the 5% promise could be an empty one.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who is at the Hague with a bipartisan group of senators, expressed optimism about the allies' efforts to raise their defense spending.",
      "\"I think everybody is united around this goal and trying to figure out how fast we can get there,\" she told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe, who is also in the Netherlands for the summit.",
      "Aside from the conflict in the Middle East, Russia's war on Ukraine continues to be a top topic of concern for NATO members. It is not yet clear whether the U.S. will support language citing Russia as the main threat to NATO in its communique \u2014 Whitaker avoided directly answering a reporter's question about this.",
      "\"Negotiations regarding the communique are still underway, so I'm not going to be able to comment directly on the specific language,\" Whitaker said, adding, \"I fully expect that the summit statement will be direct, to the point, and reflect the Allies' current threat assessment and the need for collective defense and the individual defense of all Allies.\"",
      "He said that the U.S. is \"calling for restraint and [urging] both parties to avoid escalation,\" and he went on to say that the U.S. is \"engaged at the highest levels\" and backs direct talks between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Shaheen said she'd like to see the U.S. \"put a lot more pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin,\" and she added, \"I think we need to pass the tough sanctions bill that we have in the Senate that has 82 sponsors.\"",
      "Shortly before the summit, on Saturday, the U.S. carried out strikes targeting\u00a0three Iranian sites\u00a0believed to be key to\u00a0Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was limited.\u00a0Iran fired\u00a0more than a dozen missiles at a\u00a0U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump called the retaliatory strikes \"very weak,\" and he said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\" Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei also pointed out in a social media post after the Iranian strikes, \"We didn't harm anyone.\"",
      "Within hours, Mr. Trump made the announcement that Iran and Israel would implement a ceasefire and shortly bring the war to an end.",

To feel rich, over half said they would need annual income of at least $200,000, while 25% put the figure at $1 million, according to the personal finance firm.",

The upshot: Many people are increasingly unsure of whether they'll be able to get a leg up in today's economy. The share of Americans who describe themselves as not financially secure reached 77% this year, up from 75% in 2024 and 72% in 2023, according to Bankrate.",

      "Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), a trade association that represents the health insurance industry, announced Monday that some of its biggest members are taking steps to streamline \"prior authorization\" \u2014 industry jargon for the process by which health care providers obtain approval from patients' insurance carriers to deliver care.",
      "Prior authorization requests can be time-consuming for doctors, resulting in frustrating delays for patients in obtaining essential medical care. According to a survey from the American Medical Association, physicians' offices spend an average of 12 hours per week seeking approval for services from insurers, administrative hurdles that critics say take time away from providing care.",
      "As part of the new agreement, participating insurers have committed to a series of steps they say will speed up the sluggish process. That includes creating a standardized system for submitting prior authorization online, reducing the amount of claims subject to prior authorization and ramping up real-time responses to requests. Such changes are scheduled to take effect in 2026 and 2027.",
      "\"The health care system remains fragmented and burdened by outdated manual processes, resulting in frustration for patients and providers alike,\" AHIP CEO Mike Tuffin said in a statement. \"Health plans are making voluntary commitments to deliver a more seamless patient experience and enable providers to focus on patient care, while also helping to modernize the system.\"",
      "Shawn Martin, CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said in a statement that the insurance industry initiative is a \"step in the right direction,\" but that the real test will be the impact it has on the experiences of patients and physicians.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 20:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump says the U.S. Iran strikes \"obliterated\" key nuclear sites, but an early intel assessment says Iran could reconstitute some of its capabilities in months, sources said.",
    "story": [
      "An initial classified assessment found the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said.",
      "The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said.",
      "Officials familiar with the report cautioned that it was an early assessment that could change as more information becomes available about the sites. It was not immediately clear at what confidence level the judgments included in the report were made.",
      "A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday at a press availability.",
      "\"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said.",
      "President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that \"Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "The U.S. Air Force dropped several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure \u2014 which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain \u2014 is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said.",
      "The assessment provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume their work, ranging from a few months to less than a year, the source told CBS News. The source added that Trump administration officials were warned prior to the strike that this was a possible outcome.",
      "The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said.",
      "Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities \u2014 including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges \u2014 could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon.",
      "Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN.",
      "The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment \"flat-out wrong\" and said it was leaked \"by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.\"",
      "\"The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,\" Leavitt said. \"Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\"",
      "The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear capabilities.",
      "\"The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,\" Hegseth said in a statement.",
      "A classified briefing for Congress on the administration's actions in Iran that had been scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled. Senate lawmakers are instead to be briefed by top intelligence and military officials on Thursday, one congressional aide familiar with the plan told CBS News. A similar briefing for the House will be held on Friday, according to House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation \u2014 carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles \u2014 added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks. A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding.",
      "The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon.",
      "American intelligence agencies have assessed Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. On the same day that Mr. Trump authorized strikes Saturday, one U.S. agency assessed that Iran could make a nuclear weapon in as little as three to eight months, but there was no indication that the country's Supreme Leader had authorized an effort to do so, CBS News has reported. Other U.S. intelligence agencies have said Iran would need a minimum of six to eighteen months to create a weapon they could deliver with success.",
      "But Israel has alleged Iran is \"racing towards a nuclear bomb,\" and Mr. Trump said last week he believed Iran was \"very close to having one.\" Iran has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful.",

      "The intelligence summary, issued Saturday for the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, found that Iran could build a nuclear device in months if it did not run into technical or logistical delays, two American intelligence sources familiar with the document told CBS News.",
      "But at that time, the summary did not assess that Iran had made a decision to sprint toward a nuclear weapon \u2014 lining up with U.S. assessments for years.",
      "Similar assessments were made in the days leading up to the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, and in the days afterward. The U.S. airstrikes came amid a wider dayslong Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear facilities, though Mr. Trump announced Monday that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "The intelligence summary also found that Iranian officials had discussed moving canisters of highly enriched uranium into car trunks and storing them in public parking lots to avoid destruction.",
      "Iran has increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in recent months, sparking concerns among both Iran's adversaries and international watchdogs. The country has enriched uranium up to 60% purity, which is only a short step away from the 90% level generally used in nuclear weapons.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week Iran was \"very close to having\" a nuclear weapon, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Iran \"is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly.\"",
      "The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla, testified in mid-June that if Iran were to decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it would be able to produce enough weapons-grade material for a simple nuclear weapon in one week and could make enough for 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said for years that Iran formally halted its nuclear weapons development program in 2003. In March, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still had not reauthorized the program, but \"pressure has probably built on him to do so\" \u2014 noting an \"erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public.\"",
      "Different agencies in the intelligence community may have their own assessments about what Iran's nuclear capabilities were prior to the strikes.",
      "Gabbard reiterated that assessment in testimony to Congress earlier this year. But last week, Mr. Trump told reporters Gabbard was \"wrong\" about whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon, later adding, \"I think they were very close to having one.\" Gabbard later said she and the president were on the same page, and the media was \"taking my testimony out of context.\"",
      "The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following\u00a0 a dayslong air campaign by Israel, which has alleged Iran is \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\" The impact of the weekend strikes by the U.S. is still not clear; the Pentagon offered a preliminary public assessment of the damage soon after the strikes.",
      "\"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Sunday, adding that a full assessment would take time.",
      "Iran, for its part, has long denied that it intends to build nuclear weapons, and insists its uranium enrichment program is meant for peaceful purposes.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' \"Face The Nation\" on Sunday that the Iranian sites targeted in the U.S. strikes were linked to Iran's \"nuclear weaponization ambitions.\" When asked whether the U.S. believed Khamenei had ordered the building of a nuclear weapon, Rubio called the issue \"irrelevant.\"",
      "\"They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons,\" Rubio said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump and the administration have always been right to say that if Iran chose to make a nuclear bomb, they could do so within weeks, which obviously poses an imminent threat to the US and the world.\"",
      "\"[T]hanks to President Trump's strong leadership and the incredibly successful military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, their capacity to build a nuclear bomb has been obliterated and the world can sleep easy at night,\" she added.",

    "summary": "Most would see an Iranian nuclear weapon as a serious threat but also voice concern about a wider war.",
    "story": [
      "As the public assesses the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, at least three things are in play.",
      "One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be.",
      "Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however \u2014 and netting out to a majority overall \u2014 there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war.",
      "Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon.",
      "Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran.",
      "Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern.",
      "Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.",
      "Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall.",
      "A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran.",
      "Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall.",
      "Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.)",
      "The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war.",
      "Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel.",
      "Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession. That sentiment has not abated in recent months.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,720 U.S. adults interviewed between June 22-24, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

      "\"Our experienced keeping team acted immediately, following established safety protocols, and successfully used recall training to encourage both bears back into their enclosure without the need for any intervention,\" the park said.",
      "Police were at the scene and an investigation was underway to determine how the animals managed to break out. The park said an \"operational error\" allowed the bears to escape, without elaborating.",
      "\"This was an isolated incident, and we are conducting a full internal investigation to understand exactly how it happened and to ensure robust measures are in place to prevent a reoccurrence,\" the park wrote on social media. \"While the structural integrity of the bear enclosure remains uncompromised, we take any operational lapse extremely seriously.\"",
      "The park, which covers 40 acres of gardens and woodland, is home to an array of wildlife including brown bears, wolves and arctic foxes.",

      "President Trump said Tuesday that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran was \"in effect,\" and it appeared to be holding on Tuesday afternoon after 12 days of deadly conflict between the Middle East's arch rivals.",
      "Earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump voiced frustration with both countries and accused them of violating the agreement he had announced just hours earlier. Israel accused Iran of breaching the agreement minutes after it was intended to take effect, and said it would \"respond forcefully.\"",
      "But after a last-minute intervention by Mr. Trump \u2014 including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 the bombardments appeared to cease.",
      "How the ceasefire deal announced by Trump took shape",
      "Mr. Trump said Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed to a \"Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,\" a move he said would end the 12-day conflict between the two countries.",
      "The ceasefire would take hold in stages, the president said. A White House official told CBS News that Iran would halt strikes against Israel from midnight Eastern Time, and Israel was to stop striking Iran 12 hours after that, from noon ET on Tuesday. Another 12 hours after that, or at midnight ET on Wednesday morning, the war would be considered over.",
      "Tuesday morning, Israel accused Iran of launching several missiles at Israeli territory. At least one made impact in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people. It was unclear at the time whether the missiles were fired before or after the ceasefire was due to take effect, but Israel's defense chief accused Iran of breaching the agreement, and ordered a response. Israel later said it had launched a final round of strikes on Iran, before the ceasefire began.",
      "\"In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation \u2014 I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,\" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.",
      "President Trump was quick to respond to defend his deal, saying in a message posted on his Truth Social network: \"ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!\"",
      "As he prepared to depart for a NATO summit on Tuesday, he was asked if he believed Iran or Israel had violated the ceasefire.",
      "\"I think they both violated it. I don't think, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back,\" Mr. Trump said. But he appeared to direct particular criticism at Israel.",
      "\"I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to a number of strikes on Iran that Israel said it carried out just before the ceasefire was due to begin.",
      "\"Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he would \"see if I can stop it.\"",
      "\"I'm not happy with them,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing, you understand that?\"",
      "Soon after, Israel said Mr. Trump had spoken by phone with Netanyahu.",
      "A White House source told CBS News that Mr. Trump was \"exceptionally firm and direct\" in the call about what needed to happen to sustain the ceasefire, and the source said Netanyahu had \"understood the severity of the situation and the concerns President Trump expressed.\"",
      "In a statement after their call, Netanyahu's office said Israel had \"refrained from further attacks\" after carrying out a limited strike on a radar site outside Tehran, in retaliation for Iran's latest missile launches.",
      "Israel's timeline of airstrikes and missile exchange with Iran",
      "In a statement, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a timeline of the events on Tuesday morning, saying the ceasefire had been due to take effect at 7 a.m. local time [midnight eastern], and Israel had launched attacks on \"the heart of Tehran\" at 3 a.m. local, \"hitting regime targets and killing hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces.\"",
      "\"Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which claimed the lives of four of our citizens in Beersheba,\" the statement said, adding that after 7 a.m., when the ceasefire began, Iran fired additional missiles.",
      "\"At 7:06 AM, Iran launched one missile into Israeli territory and at 10:25 AM, two more missiles. The missiles were intercepted or fell in open areas without casualties or damage,\" Netanyahu's office said. \"In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar array near Tehran. Following President Trump's conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel refrained from further attacks.\"",
      "At least 1,000 people killed in 12 days of Israel-Iran strikes",
      "The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13, when Israel launched its first strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes \u2014 which killed several top Iranian military officials \u2014 prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel.",
      "As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement. The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information.",
      "Iranian authorities have not provided casualty figures since not long after the Israeli strikes began.",
      "Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 28 people in Israel since June 13, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Iran called its response \"devastating and powerful,\" but Mr. Trump called it \"very weak.\" The president said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\"",
      "Drones hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops",

      "Several hours after the ceasefire was to take effect, Mr. Trump told reporters as he left for the summit that both Israel and Iran had violated it. Then, after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president said Israel would not bomb Iran again, and that \"the ceasefire is in effect.\"",
      "The president hoped to secure during the summit a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense. But a day before he was to arrive, the alliance had already agreed to the boost in defense spending, according to Matthew Whitaker, U.S. ambassador to NATO. He told reporters in a briefing Monday that as a result of Mr. Trump's leadership, NATO was \"on track\" to make that \"historic commitment\" of 5%.",
      "During the flight to the Netherlands, Mr. Trump posted an effusive note from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulating him on his actions in Iran and on the new NATO defense spending levels.",
      "\"[T]hank you for your decisive action in Iran,\" Rutte wrote. He called it \"truly extraordinary\" and said it was \"something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer.\"",
      "And of the new spending, Rutte said, \"It was not easy, but we've got them all signed onto 5 percent!\" He called it an \"important moment for America and Europe,\" and told him, \"You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.\" A NATO spokesperson confirmed that Rutte had written the text to Mr. Trump.",
      "The U.S. spent roughly 3.4% of GDP on defense in 2023, but the president has said he thinks the U.S. should not have the same 5% target.",
      "\"We've been supporting NATO so long, in many cases, I believe, paying almost 100% of the cost,\" he told reporters Friday. \"So, I don't think we should, but I think that the NATO countries should, absolutely.\"",
      "There is no clear timeline for the 5% commitment, however, and reaching that threshold could extend into the 2030s for some NATO countries, fueling criticism that the 5% promise could be an empty one.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who is at the Hague with a bipartisan group of senators, expressed optimism about the allies' efforts to raise their defense spending.",
      "\"I think everybody is united around this goal and trying to figure out how fast we can get there,\" she told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe, who is also in the Netherlands for the summit.",

It is not yet clear whether the U.S. will support language citing Russia as the main threat to NATO in its communique \u2014 Whitaker avoided directly answering a reporter's question about this.",
      "\"Negotiations regarding the communique are still underway, so I'm not going to be able to comment directly on the specific language,\" Whitaker said, adding, \"I fully expect that the summit statement will be direct, to the point, and reflect the Allies' current threat assessment and the need for collective defense and the individual defense of all Allies.\"",
      "He said that the U.S. is \"calling for restraint and [urging] both parties to avoid escalation,\" and he went on to say that the U.S. is \"engaged at the highest levels\" and backs direct talks between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Shaheen said she'd like to see the U.S. \"put a lot more pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin,\" and she added, \"I think we need to pass the tough sanctions bill that we have in the Senate that has 82 sponsors.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0The head of the United Nations agency supporting Palestinian refugees has condemned a controversial U.S. and Israeli-backed humanitarian organization operating in Gaza, calling it \"an abomination\" and \"a death trap costing more lives than it saves.\"",
      "The statement from Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for UNRWA, criticizing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) came as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory over the previous 24 hours, 51 of whom it said had died near GHF sites.",
      "\"There is no food. The people have starved to death, and nobody gives a damn about Gaza. Nobody talks about what's happening in Gaza,\" one man at Gaza's Nasser hospital, where injured people were being brought for care, told CBS News. \"Young men in their prime are dying. What brings these youngsters to go to the aid sites? It's hunger. The fire of hunger has ravaged the people.\"",
      "Another man at Nasser hospital said: \"I send this message to the mothers and fathers, not to send their children. Youngsters who are barely 17 are dying in vain, just to get some hummus or a bag of flour to feed their families. The Israeli army lies in wait to kill them as you can see here. Look at the victims here. Most of them have been shot in their heads. This American charity is a trap of those youngsters. Young people in their prime are dying. This is a trap.\"",
      "\"Humanitarian principles must be reinstated,\" Lazzarini said in his statement. \"The humanitarian community, including UNRWA, has the expertise and must be allowed to do their jobs and provide assistance with respect and dignity.\"",
      "\"In Gaza, atrocities continue while global attention shifts elsewhere,\" Lazzarini said after 12 days of air and missile strikes between Israel and Iran. \"A confined and captive population is bombarded, besieged and constantly displaced. More than 55,000 people are reported killed, most of them women and children. Two million people are being starved, among them 1 million children. We have said it several times and I say it once again: no place is safe in Gaza, and no one is spared.\"",
      "CBS News' team in Gaza reported a decrease in the intensity of Israeli bombardments on Monday, with drones and fighter jets seen in the skies, but most of the violence affecting people approaching GHF aid distribution points.",
      "GHF said in a statement on Tuesday that distribution \"at all sites proceeded without incident. However, today GHF formally raised complaints with the IDF regarding instances of possible harassment by Israeli soldiers directed at our convoys\" headed to one of its aid hubs.",
      "The group also pushed back, as it does in all of its daily statements, against what it called \"false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites,\" and it added that the \"Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any UN convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents.\"",
      "GHF sent an additional statement to CBS News in response to this story, saying in part: \"It is unfortunate that both organizations, especially the UN [and the Gaza Ministry of Health], continue to push false information regarding our operations. We understand the UN is also trying to deliver aid into Gaza, but yet are unaccountable about the percentage of their deliveries that are being looted versus making their final destination.\"",
      "The U.N.'s aid agencies and private organizations have refused to work with GHF, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, causing yet more mass displacement in the Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Bottomline, our aid is getting securely delivered. Instead of bickering and throwing insults from the sidelines, we would welcome the UN and other humanitarian groups to join us and feed the people in Gaza. We are ready to collaborate and help them get their aid to people in need,\" GHF said.",
      "Israel and the United States have said the new GHF-organized system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid, which the U.S.-designated terrorist organization denies doing. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors.",
      "Meanwhile, a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid for the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen nonprofit group were reported to have entered the Gaza Strip.",
      "COGAT, the agency that coordinates Israel's operations in the Palestinian territories under the authority of the country's Ministry of Defense, said over half a million pounds of baby food had entered Gaza Monday. The Israel Defense Forces said 79 trucks from various aid organizations carrying food and medical supplies had entered Gaza on Monday.",
      "Before and during much of the ongoing war in Gaza, UNRWA provided education, health care, humanitarian relief and social services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in multiple countries across the Middle East, but the group has long been accused by Israeli authorities of links to terrorism.",
      "In January, two Israeli laws came into effect banning UNRWA operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.",
      "Israeli officials accused a dozen UNRWA staff members in Gaza of being complicit in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that sparked the war. UNRWA's Lazzarini, following an internal U.N. investigation, fired nine staff members, but said the agency's priority remained \"to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region.\"",
      "UNRWA later said the Israeli government had not provided any evidence for its accusations, a position which was supported by a later independent U.N. review. However, the allegations against UNRWA prompted the U.S. government to temporarily pause its funding for the agency, and President Trump, earlier this year, made the end of American support for the agency indefinite.",
      "In March, UNRWA issued a public appeal for a resumption of the American funding.",
      "\"UNRWA's financial situation is dire,\" Lazzarini said Tuesday. \"Cash flow is managed now on a weekly basis instead of monthly let alone yearly. Without additional funding, I will soon have to take unprecedented decisions affecting our services to Palestine Refugees across the region. The loss of UNRWA's stabilising effect on a region increasingly in turmoil will also be consequential.\"",
      "Lazzarini stressed that UNRWA provides a range of services to Palestinian refugees that a functioning Palestinian state, if one were to be created, could take over, including education and medical care.",
      "\"A genuine, time-bound political process would allow the Agency to finally transition its government-like services to empowered and prepared public institutions serving Palestinians,\" he said. \"In the absence of an orderly transition, the sudden loss or reduction of UNRWA's services will only deepen suffering and despair across the occupied Palestinian territory. It might spark unrest in the neighbouring countries. This is something that the region cannot afford, especially now.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oil-price-prices-iran-military-strike-crude-gasoline-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 06:46:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Global crude prices jumped on Sunday but have since retreated. Here's what experts say about the outlook for oil and gas.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on supplies of oil and gas, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices for Americans.",
      "The price of the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, jumped 4% on Sunday night shortly after the start of trading, but fell more than 7% on Monday afternoon. The decline came as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial waterway that the country partly controls and that is strategically vital for the flow of crude into global markets.",
      "Iran's parliament on Sunday approved cutting off the Strait, leaving the final decision to the country's national security council. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran announced by President Trump early Tuesday appeared to falter within a couple hours.",
      "The geopolitical crisis is sparking concerns that worsening hostilities could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would likely drive up gas and other energy costs, as well for other products refined from crude. Iran said Monday that it launched an attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.",
      "Iran, a major producer of crude, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by ships carrying roughly 20% of the world's daily supply of oil.",
      "\"In practice, Iranian efforts to 'close' the Strait could encompass a number of actions including attacking and detaining ships using the waterway, impeding navigability through the strait and, at the most extreme, laying mines in the sea,\" noted David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a report.",
      "But, he added, \"[S]o long as the conflict does not become a long-lasting war with no 'off ramp,' and disruption in the Strait remains limited to the lower-level actions seen up to now, we suspect that any initial spikes in global energy prices would dissipate before long.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Iran conflict's potential impact on oil and gas prices.",
      "What's the impact so far on oil prices?",
      "After surging in early trading on Monday, prices of Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 0.1% to $76.98 by midday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the U.S. benchmark, fell 3.8% to $71.06.",
      "Still, oil prices remain above their level before the hostilities between Israel and Iran began over a week ago, when a barrel of WTI crude was close to $68.",
      "Although Wall Street experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, they note that ongoing tensions in the region could disrupt the energy market and send prices soaring.",
      "\"Perhaps a bigger risk to the region's oil supply would be Israeli air strikes on Iran's oil production and export facilities, and/or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on oil production and export facilities in Iraq,\" Eurasia Group analysts said in a June 23 report.",
      "Israel so far has avoided targeting Iran's oil export industry. But if it were to do so, such strikes could disrupt the flow of several million barrels per day, sending Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel, according to the political risk consultancy.",
      "What would happen if the Strait of Hormuz is closed?",
      "Because the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, it's vulnerable to disruption. The channel connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.",
      "Although energy experts believe a closure of the Strait is unlikely, noting the adverse economic and geopolitical impact on Iran, they underline that a disruption to the flow of oil through the passage would send energy prices soaring.",
      "Interruptions to oil passing through the channel would severely impact markets in China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "The U.S. imports only about 7% of its oil through the Strait of Hormuz. But any interference with shipments passing through the area could impact the global oil market by stifling supplies, according to experts.",
      "\"[W]hile Iran has not yet targeted the route, even a limited disruption would severely impact global supply,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a June 20 client note. \"In a worst-case scenario, prices could spike to $130 per barrel and shave 0.8 percentage points off global GDP.\"",
      "The last time Brent crude topped $130 was in 2008, the result of a spike in energy demand and uncertainty in world energy supplies, according to the EIA. At the time, gasoline prices peaked at about $4.11 per gallon, or about $6.26 per gallon today after adjusting for inflation.",
      "What's the forecast for U.S. gas prices?",
      "American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon, GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan said.",
      "\"Most/all of the recent and expected rise is due to the Middle East tensions/situation,\" he said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even with that increase, U.S. drivers would still likely be paying less at the pump than they were a year ago. The average U.S. gas price now stands at $3.22 per gallon, down from $3.45 per gallon a year earlier, according to AAA.",

      "The Israeli government announced that, \"In light of achieving the objectives of the operation, and in full coordination with President Trump, Israel has agreed to the president's proposal for a bilateral ceasefire. Israel will respond forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire.\"",
      "At about the same time, Iranian state television said the ceasefire had begun.",
      "Mr. Trump posted Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed on a \"Complete and Total CEASEFIRE\", a move he said would end the more than weeklong conflict between the two countries.",
      "The ceasefire was to take hold in stages, the president said.",
      "Under the ceasefire announced by Mr. Trump Monday evening, Iran was to stop striking Israel in six hours (at midnight ET on Tuesday), and Israel was to stop striking Iran 12 hours after that (at noon ET Tuesday). Then, after another 12 hours, or at midnight ET Wednesday, the war would be considered over, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces had reported a series of missile barrages from Iran both before and after Mr. Trump's midnight deadline for Iran to halt the strikes. Israel did not specify when the missiles were launched, and it's unclear whether the latest missile strikes violated the terms laid out by Mr. Trump.",
      "Hours after Mr. Trump's initial post, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested on X that Iran had stopped its strikes on Israel at 4 a.m. Tehran time (8:30 p.m. ET Monday). Iran's military operations \"continued until the very last minute,\" he wrote.",
      "But Araghchi also wrote that \"there is NO 'agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations,\" though he added that Iran didn't plan to continue strikes on Israel if Israel also ceased strikes at the same time. The timeline laid out by Mr. Trump called for Israel to stop striking about 15 hours after the time specified by Araghchi.",
      "\"The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later,\" Araghchi wrote.",
      "In another Truth Social post later Monday night, following the Iranian foreign minister's comments, Mr. Trump wrote, in part, that Israel and Iran \"came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, 'PEACE!' I knew the time was NOW.\"",
      "Prior to Araghchi's comments, a senior White House official told CBS News both sides had agreed to a ceasefire, with Israel agreeing as long as there are no further Iranian strikes.",

      "Qatar helped broker a deal, another White House official said. Mr. Trump had asked the Qatari Emir to get Iran to agree to a ceasefire. Vance coordinated with the Qatari prime minister on details, and Iran agreed to the ceasefire after speaking to the prime minister. The official said the direct talks with Iran occurred after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base.",
      "The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13 with Israel launching airstrikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes \u2014 which killed several top Iranian military officials \u2014 prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel.",
      "As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran\u00a0said in a statement. The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information.",
      "Iran's attacks have killed at least 24 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Iran called its response \"devastating and powerful,\" but Mr. Trump called it \"very weak.\" The president said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\"",
      "Dispute over Iran's nuclear program still lingers",
      "It's not clear how the ceasefire announcement will impact a broader dispute over the fate of Iran's nuclear program.",

      "Israel has alleged Iran was secretly \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\" But earlier this year, U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Iran was not making nuclear weapons, though \"pressure has probably built\" for Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to reauthorize the country's nuclear weapons program.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week he believed the intelligence community was \"wrong\" about Iran's nuclear ambitions, telling reporters, \"I think they were very close to having one.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the issue \"irrelevant\" in an interview Sunday\u00a0on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" saying Iranian officials \"have everything they need to build the weapon.\"",

      "More than two decades in the making, the giant U.S.-funded telescope sits perched at the summit of Cerro Pachon in central Chile, where dark skies and dry air provide ideal conditions for observing the cosmos. The first-look images captured star-forming regions as well as distant galaxies.",
      "One of them is a composite of 678 exposures taken over just seven hours, capturing the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula \u2014 both several thousand light-years from Earth \u2014 glowing in vivid pinks against orange-red backdrops.",
      "The image reveals these stellar nurseries within our Milky Way in unprecedented detail, with previously faint or invisible features now clearly visible.",
      "Another image offers a sweeping view of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies.",
      "The team also released a video dubbed the \"cosmic treasure chest,\" which begins with a close-up of two galaxies before zooming out to reveal approximately 10 million more.",
      "\"The Rubin Observatory is an investment in our future, which will lay down a cornerstone of knowledge today on which our children will proudly build tomorrow,\" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.",
      "Equipped with an advanced 8.4-meter telescope and the largest digital camera ever built, the Rubin Observatory is supported by a powerful data-processing system.",
      "Later this year, it will begin its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Over the next decade, it will scan the night sky nightly, capturing even the subtlest visible changes with unmatched precision.",

      "\"So, we really need very sharp images,\" Urbach said.",
      "The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, \"really far away ... means they come from earlier times.\"",
      "The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter \u2014 a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies.",
      "Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown.",
      "The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids.",
      "In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects \u2014 all of which pose no threat.",
      "For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year.",

      "The decision by Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' lawyers to not call any witnesses to testify in his federal trial for sex crimes comes down to the prosecution's burden of reasonable doubt, according to legal experts.",
      "Diddy's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, indicated Monday in court that the defense plans to review evidence with the jury, and won't require witnesses to testify on the rapper's behalf. The rapper's legal team expects to rest its case Wednesday, with closing arguments expected to begin the following day.",
      "\"The decision whether or not to call witnesses during the defense case is a calculated risk,\" criminal defense and civil attorney\u00a0Adant\u00e9 Pointer of Lawyers for the People LLC told Fox News Digital.",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs won't testify in his federal trial for sex crimes. (Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images)",
      "\"Not calling any witnesses means the defense is essentially telling the jury there is no one they know in the whole universe who can speak on Diddy's behalf to aid his defense. On the other hand, calling a witness can open that person up to questioning and perhaps elicit damaging testimony against Diddy, depending upon their interactions with him and their knowledge of these women.\"",
      "Pointer likened the defense's decision not to call any witnesses to a \"Pandora's box.\"",
      "\"Given the defense is signaling they do not intend to call a single witness, they do not think any potential defense-friendly witnesses will result in a net gain for Diddy. His lawyers have essentially determined the juice is not worth the squeeze.\"",
      "MISSING WITNESSES AND LINGERING QUESTIONS PLAGUE PROSECUTION AS DIDDY TRIAL NEARS CONCLUSION: EXPERT",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian will likely ask Diddy to confirm his decision not to take the stand.",
      "\"Diddy testifying would just allow the prosecution to retell their case and put the previous items of evidence in front of the jury for a second or third time,\" Pointer explained. \"The prosecution would have a field day going through each and every video, text and witness statement made at trial against him and force Diddy to admit the authenticity of the videos, the receipts and invoices, items recovered at his homes and hotel rooms, and that he was present during the events described in prior testimony.",
      "Diddy's defense won't call any witnesses in his federal trial. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"In light of the evidence already presented at trial, this would most likely be an excoriating and humiliating cross-examination, the kind prosecutors wait their whole career to conduct.\"",
      "Closing arguments for the trial, which began May 5 with jury selection, are expected to begin Thursday after Diddy's lawyers explained they would only need two days to defend their client.",
      "Trial attorney\u00a0Tre Lovell told Fox News Digital that the defense likely wants to double down on reasonable doubt, and that Diddy's \"exotic lifestyle\" does not equal what the prosecution has proposed, which is that \"Diddy formed a criminal enterprise to pleasure himself, the Tony Soprano of baby oil.\"",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"The only reason to not call witnesses in your defense is if you absolutely believe there is reasonable doubt, and you don\u2019t want to do anything to take away from this, including calling your own witnesses,\" Lovell said. \"It would make sense to call a psychiatrist to explain that the behavior of Cassie and Jane is more reflective of a consensual relationship, based upon the autonomy each woman had, the benefits they received and the love they had for Diddy.",
      "Duddy's federal trial began May 5 and the case is expected to rest this week. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Further, calling executives at Bad Boy Entertainment would be helpful to distance the corporations from Diddy\u2019s more personal behavior, to dispel the criminal enterprise element. Finally, possibly an industry or legal expert to distinguish the aspects of \u2018sex workers\u2019 versus \u2018prostitution,\u2019 to counter the prostitution charge.\"",
      "Lovell added, \"However, the defense felt even calling witnesses such as these would have the potential of adversely affecting reasonable doubt, and chose not to.\"",
      "Mark Chutkow, who previously led the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit, believed Diddy's decision not to testify was \"a smart one.\"",
      "\"It's a real big gamble to testify in a case like this where the prosecution has brought racketeering charges, which allows them to bring this wealth of bad acts evidence there,\" Chutkow said. \"By taking the stand, he would just subject himself to even more bad acts that were prohibited by the court. And so that was probably the right call.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "\"Diddy's decision not to testify can also be considered savvy, as well, because he can say in closing, \u2018Look, to the jury, the prosecution had six weeks of time to show you, to try and prove their case.\u2019 The defense lawyers are going to say this: 'We showed the reasonable doubt through our cross-examination, and we don't want to waste any more of your time. You have enough now to know that there's reasonable doubt in this case, and that's why we didn't bring a case.' And to remind the jury that the presumption of innocence always goes to Diddy as the defendant in this case.\"",
      "Cassie Ventura testified in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial for sex crimes. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Chutkow noted how the burden of proof is on the government, not on the Bad Boy Records founder or his team.",
      "\"When you present a case, if you're on the defense side, you better be good, because if it falls flat, then you kind of move back the marker, and you might be in a worse position,\" the lawyer said. \"So sometimes less is more. I know that some people are suggesting that, 'Well, wow, doesn't he have something he could put on?' It may be in some ways an opportunity for the defense to say, 'No, we didn't need to.'\"",
      "WATCH: LEGAL EXPERT EXPLAINS DIDDY'S DEFENSE MOVES",
      "With the case nearing its close more than seven weeks after it began, and nine months after Diddy was arrested and charged, Chutkow thought both sides did \"what they sought to accomplish.\"",
      "\"The prosecution has put in all the evidence. It wasn't excluded. The defense, though, has done a nice job in the cross-examinations,\" he said. \"They've brought in a lot of additional communications between Diddy and these other women to show that the relationship is a lot more complex.",
      "\"One of the things I think the prosecution is going to have to do at the closing argument is to basically say, 'Look, this is not like a trafficking case that you would see on television. It's not, you don't have a situation of someone being kidnapped and chained on a basement radiator. It's, in essence, it's a golden cage. It is one with luxury and glamor, but it's still a cage.'\"",

      "Chutkow added, \"The other area that I think that they would want to emphasize is the blackmail in this case. That the use of the tapes and threat of exposure of those tapes to get the women to comply with what Diddy wanted to do is an element of coercion in and of itself. And if I was on the prosecution side, I would look to that as compelling evidence.\"",

      "Flirtatious moment with Clint Eastwood",
      "While interviewing Clint Eastwood at his California ranch in 1982, Walters and the \"Dirty Harry\" actor discussed how he keeps most of his feelings inside, often not even sharing his worries with romantic partners.",
      "\"You would drive me nuts, and I would drive you crazy because I would be saying, \u2018But didn\u2019t you? Or haven\u2019t you?\u2019\" Walters told Eastwood as they sat facing each other on a picnic bench.",

      "After a long pause, Walters said to the camera, \"I think we\u2019ll stop and reload\" as everyone burst out in laughter.",
      "\"Barbara had her fill of romance,\" gossip columnist Cindy Williams said in the documentary. \"She thought a lot of guys were sexy. She was interested in the possibility of sex. She liked it. She liked men.\"",

      "\"She was never cynical about love, and she was definitely a romantic kind of person,\" makeup artist Lori Klein said. \"But romance just never worked in her life for long.\"",
      "Walters revealed on \"The Tonight Show\" in 2014 that Eastwood had asked her out to dinner after the interview, but she said no because she had work.",
      "\"This is a sad love story,\" she told host Jimmy Fallon. \"I did this interview with Clint Eastwood something like 30 years ago. He was very flirtatious, and I was very taken (with him). He asked me if I wanted to have dinner... and I said, 'No, I have to work.' You know, I don't mix business with pleasure,\" which she said she later regretted.",
      "\"I could have been Mrs. Clint Eastwood!\" she added.",
      "Obsession with 'money, fame and power'",
      "\"She was obsessed with three things: She was obsessed with money, fame and power,\" Peter Gethers, the editor of her autobiography, told the documentary. \"When I would have conversations with her about her father, her father was a scoundrel. Her father was irresponsible with money, he was not a perfect family man. Scoundrel was the right word. And I think she was both horrified by that and attracted to that.\"",
      "He said one of the most difficult things in editing her autobiography was dealing with her close relationship with the late attorney Roy Cohn.",

      "Gethers also claimed that Walters \"didn\u2019t have the strongest moral compass. A lot of the relationships she developed were career moves. And she was a pretty transactional person.\"",

      "\"When my father lost everything, he also had not paid his taxes in New York. And Roy Cohn said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it,\u2019\" Walters was quoted as saying in the documentary. \"\u2018I will take care of it.\u2019 I don\u2019t know how he did it. I don\u2019t know what judges he talked to. I forgot about ethics, and I had been severely criticized by my friends and I can understand because Roy did some terrible things, but this was my father and he saved him.\"",
      "Gethers elaborated, \"She didn\u2019t see things in that kind of moral light. That stuff was always in the shadows. She could forgive anyone who was really good to her no matter what they did in the other parts of their lives.\"",

      "Jealous of Diane Sawyer",
      "Martin Clancy, a former ABC News producer, said in the documentary, \"Barbara watched Diane warily because she was really in the same altitude as Barbara. Other correspondents were not a threat. I think Barbara secretly resented Diane for being younger.\"",
      "Reporter Cynthia McFadden explained that Sawyer had booked Katharine Hepburn \"fair and square\" for an interview once and Walters put \"a lot of pressure\" on the actress to do an interview with her instead, but Hepburn wouldn\u2019t do it.",
      "\"If I showed up on Mars, she would have a note there in the Barbara Walters stationery just requesting an interview with anybody who might happen to show,\" Sawyer jokingly said in a clip shared on the documentary.",

She used the word \u2018blonde goddess.\u2019 This ideal woman. And she, Barbara, couldn\u2019t compete with that. She could work harder, she could know more people, but she couldn\u2019t compete with that. The blonde goddess.\"",

      "McFadden added, \"This has been interpreted, I think, by a lot of people to say that Barbara was not good to other women. And I think that is a canard. Not at all. She couldn\u2019t tolerate having Diane Sawyer rise in what she saw as a direct challenge to what she had accomplished. What a sadness. Talk about the death of joy.\"",

      "She \u2018neglected\u2019 her personal life for the sake of her career",
      "Walters is quoted in the documentary as saying that she was 23 years old when she first got married and went straight from her parents\u2019 house to her first home with her husband. \"And it was a marriage that never should have been,\" she said.",
      "She also adopted her only child, Jackie, when she was in her 30s during her second marriage.",

      "Walters once said she was disappointed when her second marriage ended because, at that time, their daughter was 4. \"I don\u2019t think I was very good at marriage. It may be that my career was just too important. It may have been that I was a difficult person to be married to, and I wasn\u2019t willing perhaps to give that much. But through it all there was this career I felt I needed to have, and I loved it.\"",
      "She added, \"When I was in my 20s and 30s, when I should have been dating, I was working day and night. I didn\u2019t have those kinds of years. I didn\u2019t have those years until I was in my 30s and 40s. Mine was a very delayed romantic period.\"",
      "Walters said in an interview she didn\u2019t realize how much Jackie struggled with having a mother who was a celebrity, revealing that she ran away when she was 16.",
      "\"She had a charged, complex relationship with her daughter,\" Oprah Winfrey said. \"I remember her telling me once it\u2019s really fulfilling having children, and you should really think about it, and I was like \u2018OK, but I\u2019m looking at you, so no,\u2019\" Winfrey said, adding that she knew she could only do one thing well and being a mother and a career woman are both sacrifices.",

      "McFadden, who interviewed Jackie as an adult about her relationship with her mother, said she felt Walters worried their relationship was \"shaky\" and thought she and her daughter might have \"fallen out again.\"",
      "Walters said once, \"Look, are there times when I look at people, I\u2019ve got a friend, for example, who\u2019s got four children and 11 grandchildren, and she says, \u2018Look at your life,\u2019 and I say, \u2018Look at your life. I mean, how rich you are. Four children, 11 grandchildren. That\u2019s richness.' But I don\u2019t have that. I didn\u2019t take that path.\"",
      "Couric added, \"I felt like she neglected her personal life and poured so much into her work life that I\u2019m not sure she was a truly happy person. And I remember thinking I want to make sure that I have a family, that I don\u2019t just have a big job, and I always got the sense that Barbara wished she had paid more attention to that.\"",

      "Diddy's legal team, headed by Marc Agnifilo and Teny Geragos, initially indicated they would need upwards of two weeks to plead their case, but told Judge Arun Subramanian last week that they may be able to rest by Tuesday or Wednesday.",

      "\"What happened to Gina, who was Victim 3 in the indictment? The government said they were unable to get a hold of her, and she did not testify,\" Rahmani said. \"Was she afraid, embarrassed, paid off by Combs, or was there another reason why she didn\u2019t comply with the subpoena?\u00a0Regardless, it was a mistake by the prosecution to list her as a victim when they did not have assurances that she would appear.\u00a0They should have known Combs has the resources to threaten or pay witnesses not to testify and have planned accordingly.\"",

Therefore, they're back there to basically check off boxes. If the government has done this, check it off. If the government has done that, check it off.

      "Around 11% of adults between the ages of 65 and 74 have lost all of their teeth, according to 2020 data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2014 and that number rises to one in five at age 75 and older.",
      "But according to experts, this isn\u2019t inevitable. Dental professionals shared the following tips to prevent tooth loss and boost overall health.",
      "1. Protect gum health",
      "About two in three adults over age 65 are dealing with some form of gum disease, according to a recently published AARP report.",
      "6 SIMPLE WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR HEARING NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS",

      "The publication also points to previous research linking gum disease to other health risks, such as heart attack, stroke and cancer.",
      "Around 11% of adults between the ages of 65 and 74 have lost all of their teeth.",

      "\"It\u2019s especially valuable for patients with arthritis, limited mobility or trouble using traditional floss,\" Frey told Fox News Digital.",
      "2. Take steps to prevent dry mouth",
      "Saliva plays an essential role in neutralizing acids and protecting tooth enamel, but dry mouth affects nearly six in 10 older adults, according to AARP.",
      "Many common medications \u2014 including antihistamines, antidepressants and blood pressure drugs \u2014 can reduce saliva production, making the mouth more prone to tooth decay, infection and gum disease, WebMD states.",

      "To prevent dry mouth, AARP recommends sipping water regularly, rinsing the mouth after eating, asking your dentist about prescription-strength fluoride toothpaste, and using dry mouth rinses like Biotene or Act.",
      "3. Personalize your dental visits",
      "Contrary to the standard six-month checkup rule, AARP notes that dental care schedules should be personalized.",
      "One doctor in the report noted that there\u2019s \"nothing magical about a six-month checkup\" \u2014 some people may only need to go once a year, while others, especially those with chronic conditions, may need more frequent visits.",
      "The recommended frequency of dental visits is not one-size-fits-all, according to AARP. Some people may only need to go once a year, while others, especially those with chronic conditions, may need more frequent visits. (iStock)",

      "4. Explore options for financial help",
      "Only three in 10 adults over 65 have dental insurance, per the American Dental Association, and Medicare may not cover all necessary procedures.",
      "Many common medications can reduce saliva production, making the mouth more prone to decay, experts say. (iStock)",
      "This financial gap often leads people to skip dental care altogether, which can cause more serious (and expensive) problems in the future.",
      "AARP suggests looking into dental savings plans, local dental schools or sliding-scale community clinics if coverage is an issue.",
      "5. Adopt healthy habits",
      "Smoking is a major contributor to tooth loss.",
      "CDC data shows that smokers are up to three times more likely to lose all their teeth than non-smokers.",
      "CDC data shows that smokers are up to three times more likely to lose all of their teeth than non-smokers. (iStock)",
      "And while sugary cough drops or hard candies may seem harmless, they can be damaging to tooth enamel over time, experts warn.",
      "Switching to sugar-free gum or candies containing xylitol may help prevent cavities and support better oral health, Akosa told AARP.",
      "6. Restore appearance",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions about aging and dental health is that worn, discolored teeth are something to simply accept, according to Frey.",
      "\"It\u2019s not just about revitalizing the teeth \u2014 it\u2019s about revitalizing the person.\"",
      "\"A delicate, thin porcelain veneer can restore the vitality, color and shape your teeth once had, enhancing your smile and overall appearance,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "Currently a New York state assemblyman, Mamdani has gained some recognition through endorsements from big-name figures such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. However, he has also gained notoriety in his own right due to a platform chock-full of free services that he has promised New York residents.",

      "Fox News' Jennifer Griffin reports the latest on the U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "While President Donald Trump has asserted that the military's weekend strike against Iran \"completely and totally obliterated\" its nuclear weapon-making capabilities, there are still questions about whether the ground-penetrating \"bunker buster\" bombs used to attack Iran's key enrichment sites were enough to stop the rogue country from developing a nuclear bomb.",
      "A report released last week by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) explains that the special \"bunker buster\" bombs the U.S. used in Iran over the weekend that everyone is talking about, known as GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs, might not be able to fully destroy the Iranian nuclear facility at Fordow. Fordow, which Trump said was \"gone\" now following the strike, is considered central to Iran's nuclear weapon-making capabilities.",
      "Meanwhile, a satellite imagery expert relayed to Reuters that confirmation of below-ground destruction could not be determined via pictures alone, because the facility's hundreds of centrifuges are too deeply buried in order to make an accurate determination.",
      "EXPERT CONFIDENT IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS 'NO LONGER' AFTER MASSIVE US STRIKE",

      "\"I actually have a little bit of a rosier view on things,\" Andrea Stricker, Deputy Director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Nonproliferation and Biodefense Program, told Fox News Digital. \"I think that because of the massive damage and the shock wave that would have been sent by 12 Massive Ordnance Penetrators at the Fordow site, that it likely would render its centrifuges damaged or inoperable.\"",
      "Stricker noted that centrifuges are \"very delicate\" and the kind of shock wave coming from the MOPs would at least put them \"out of commission.\" She also said if any centrifuges did survive the blasts, it would be likely that they would be inaccessible by Iranian authorities for several months.",
      "\"Underground facilities present a difficult target, not only for destruction, but also in terms of follow-on battle damage assessment,\" added Wes Rumbaugh, a fellow in the Missile Defense Project at CSIS. \"The United States and Israel will likely need to invest additional intelligence resources to determine the true extent of the damage from the U.S. strikes and their long-term effect on Iranian nuclear infrastructure.\"",

      "This satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies shows damage at the Fordow enrichment facility in Iran after U.S. strikes, Sunday, June 22, 2025. (Maxar Technologies via AP)",
      "In addition to Fordow, the U.S. used its MOPs at an Iranian enrichment facility called Natanz, where, according to Stricker, at least 1,000 centrifuges are located, as well as an above-ground enrichment plant and other labs capable of making uranium metal.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) the above-ground labs had previously been damaged by Israeli airstrikes, destroying the plant's electrical infrastructure. Meanwhile, satellite imagery following the U.S.'s decision to drop two MOPs on Natanz show two craters located where the site's underground enrichment facilities are reportedly located. However, it is still not clear if the U.S. attacks completely destroyed the underground nuclear infrastructure.",
      "Either way, Striker noted, the significant damage to Iran's Natanz facility will create a \"bottleneck\" in the country's supply chain for weapons-grade uranium, which will significantly impact Iran's nuclear weapon-making capabilities.",
      "The Natanz nuclear site is seen on the left on May 20, 2025. On June 22, damage could be seen in the area following American airstrikes. (Planet Labs PBC)",
      "The third site targeted by the U.S.'s airstrikes was Iran's Isfahan nuclear enrichment facility, but MOPs were not used at that site. Instead, the U.S. used Tomahawk cruise missiles, which the IAEA confirmed caused significant damage. Satellite imagery reportedly shows Isfahan's above-ground facilities were taken out, but it remains unclear the extent of the damage to the site's underground sections.",

      "This satellite image shows Iran's Isfahan nuclear enrichment site following the United States' missile attack on the facility over the weekend.\u00a0 (Satellite image \u00a92025 Maxar Technologies)",
      "One of the biggest outstanding questions regarding the success of the United States' weekend strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, is whether authorities in the country were able to move their nuclear materials from the targeted sites before the U.S. launched its missiles at them. But, according to CSIS's Bumbaugh, even if that is the case and Iran moved their nuclear materials, the chaos would still make it hard for Iran to \"sprint to a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "\"Having to move these assets to new facilities likely degrades Iran's immediate ability to sprint to a nuclear weapon but makes it likely that Iran will go to great lengths to conceal their new location,\" Bumbaugh said. \"This movement of nuclear infrastructure or material would make follow-on strikes difficult if intelligence is unable to find all of the new hidden facilities.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"There's a lot of alarmism right now about whether Iran could sprint to a bomb,\" Stricker added. \"Israel has done so much damage to their ability to make nuclear weapons [and] the weaponization supply chain. So the facilities, the components that [Iran] would need, the equipment, and then up to 14 nuclear scientists, I think, if they did want to build a bomb quickly, they're really stymieing \u2013 they don't have access to all of all that, all of those assets they would need. And so, I think in the short to medium term, we don't need to be overly concerned that they could get there.\"",
      "Fox News Digital reached out to both the Pentagon and the Air Force to glean more details about the success of the weekend strike on Iran, but no new information was gleaned.",
      "An Air Force spokesperson did confirm to Fox News Digital that, in total, U.S. forces deployed 75 \"precision guided weapons\" targeting Iran over the weekend, including 14 30,000 pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators.",
      "On Monday, Rafael Grossi, head of the IAEA, appealed for immediate access to the targeted Iranian nuclear sites in order to assess the damage that is likely \"significant,\" according to the United Nations."

      "Worried about who has access to your health data? While you can't control every breach or broker, you can take steps to limit what's collected, shared, and sold. Here's how to take back control of your digital health footprint-starting today.",
      "1) Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0Data brokers collect and sell sensitive health information, including diagnoses, prescriptions, and personal identifiers, to marketers, insurers, and other third parties. This means details about your pharmacy purchases, symptom-related searches, and more could be circulating without your knowledge. A personal data removal service can help you take back control. This is one of the most effective ways to safeguard your privacy and protect yourself and your family from risks like scams, higher insurance premiums, and discrimination.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "3) Be wary of free health quizzes and symptom checkers:\u00a0If a site asks for personal details in exchange for \"insights,\" assume it\u2019s monetizing your answers. Consult your doctor, not a clickbait quiz.",
      "4) Limit data sharing beyond healthcare providers:\u00a0Only provide necessary information when signing up for health-related services or apps. Be wary of sharing health details on social media or in public forums, as these can be scraped by data brokers.",
      "5) Request data minimization from providers:\u00a0Ask your healthcare providers to collect and store only the minimum amount of personal information necessary for your care, reducing the risk if their systems are compromised.",
      "6) Use strong antivirus software: Strong antivirus software acts as a shield, protecting your devices from malware, ransomware, and other cyber threats that could compromise your personal health data. Choose a reputable solution that offers real-time threat detection, regular updates, and robust protection for all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Keeping your antivirus up to date is crucial for blocking malicious links and downloads before they can do harm.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "7) Regularly update your software:\u00a0Cyber threats targeting health data are constantly evolving, and outdated software can leave your devices vulnerable to attacks that expose your sensitive information. Keeping your operating system, apps, antivirus, and security tools\u00a0up to date ensures you have the latest protections against malware, ransomware, and other exploits that data brokers or hackers might use to access your health information. Regular updates patch security holes before they can be exploited, helping to prevent breaches like those that have exposed millions of Americans' health details in recent years.",
      "8) Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0Your health data is often protected by passwords on apps, portals, and devices. Using strong, unique passwords for each account reduces the risk that a single breach could give someone access to multiple sources of your personal information. Avoid common or reused passwords, and consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely. This step is crucial because once your login credentials are compromised, data brokers or cybercriminals can gather and sell your health-related data, leading to privacy violations, discrimination, or targeted scams. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your health should be personal, but in today's digital world, that privacy is constantly under threat. Even if you're cautious, your health-related information can be collected, analyzed, and sold without your clear consent. The good news is that you can take real steps to reduce your exposure and protect what matters. This isn't about fear; it's about staying informed and taking control of your digital footprint.",

      "Forerunner K2 \"Bumblebee\" humanoid robot at the SAIC-GM automotive plant. (Kepler Robotics)",
      "Addressing concerns about job displacement",
      "The introduction of advanced humanoid robots like Kepler's K2 naturally raises questions about the future of human employment in manufacturing and other industries. It's true that automation and robotics have the potential to change the way work is organized on the factory floor. Some worry that robots could replace jobs traditionally held by people, especially in roles that involve repetitive or physically demanding tasks.",
      "However, experts and industry leaders point out that the story is more nuanced. While certain jobs may be automated, new opportunities often emerge alongside technological advancements. For example, the rise of robotics is expected to create roles in robot maintenance, programming, AI training, and oversight, jobs that require different skills but are essential to supporting and managing these new systems. Many analysts believe that robots like the K2 are likely to complement human workers by taking over monotonous or hazardous duties, which allows people to focus on more complex, creative, or supervisory tasks.",
      "Collaborative robots, or \"cobots,\" are specifically designed to work alongside humans, enhancing productivity and safety rather than simply replacing labor. This collaborative approach can lead to new forms of teamwork and innovation on the factory floor, making work environments safer and more efficient. Ultimately, the integration of humanoid robots is expected to shift the workforce rather than eliminate it, opening up new possibilities for both businesses and employees as they adapt to a more automated future.",

      "2. Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0 If you're receiving password reset emails from accounts you don't remember signing up for, or from multiple services, there's a good chance your personal information is exposed on data broker sites. These companies collect and sell your data, including your email, phone number, home address and even login information from old accounts. Using a reputable data removal service can help you automatically identify and request the removal of your personal data from these sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft, credential stuffing, phishing and spam.",

      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "3. Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA): Enabling\u00a02FA is one of the most effective ways to stop unauthorized access, even if someone has your password. When 2FA is active, anyone trying to log in must also complete a second verification step, usually through an app on your phone. If an attacker triggers a login attempt, you will receive a prompt to approve or deny it. This gives you the power to block the attempt in real time and confirms that 2FA is working as intended.",
      "4. Install strong antivirus software: Install strong antivirus software to catch malware before it causes harm. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Review your account settings: Make sure your recovery phone number and email are current. Remove any outdated or unused backup methods.",
      "6. Keep your software up to date: Keep your device software and apps\u00a0up to date to patch security vulnerabilities that attackers often exploit.",
      "7. Use a VPN to protect your online activity: Avoid public Wi-Fi or use a VPN to protect your information when browsing on unsecured networks. Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "It's easy to brush off an unexpected password reset message, especially if nothing else seems out of place. But these alerts are often the digital equivalent of a knock at the door when you weren't expecting anyone. Whether it's a hacker probing for a way in or a scammer trying to bait you, the smartest move is to treat every unexpected security message as a wake-up call. Taking just a few minutes to check your login history, secure your accounts and update your passwords can make all the difference. Cybersecurity isn't just for experts anymore. It's an integral part of everyday life. And the more proactive you are now, the less likely you'll be dealing with damage control later.",

In recent years, tax preparation companies, accounting software vendors and data brokers have all found themselves in the crosshairs of increasingly aggressive ransomware gangs.

      "6 ways you can stay safe from Optima data breach",
      "If your information was part of the Optima breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Optima data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Optima data breach might have revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud. To report identity theft, visit the FTC\u2019s\u00a0IdentityTheft.gov.",
      "3. \u00a0Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Optima hackers might have obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies \u2014 Equifax, Experian or TransUnion \u2014 and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",

      "4. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you. One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Optima hackers most likely have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. Two-factor authentication requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Optima breach is not an isolated event, but part of a larger failure to adapt to the sophistication of modern ransomware groups. When companies with access to tax and identity data are compromised, it\u2019s not just an internal issue; it becomes a national one. For an industry built on trust, breaches like this erode public confidence in systems that are already strained. Attacks like these raise fresh concerns about the cybersecurity preparedness of companies that handle tax and financial data. Unlike login credentials or email addresses, stolen tax information cannot be easily reset. For victims, the consequences of such a breach could stretch across years.",

      "ChatGPT on a computer\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI uses so much power, and what drives the demand",
      "Running artificial intelligence at scale requires enormous computational power. Unlike traditional internet activity, which mostly involves pulling up stored information, AI tools perform intensive real-time processing. Whether training massive language models or responding to user prompts, AI systems rely on specialized hardware like GPUs (graphics processing unit) that consume far more power than legacy servers. GPUs are designed to handle many calculations in parallel, which is perfect for the matrix-heavy workloads that power generative AI and deep learning systems.",
      "To give you an idea of scale: one Nvidia H100 GPU, commonly used in AI training, consumes up to 700 watts on its own. Training a single large AI model like GPT-4 may require thousands of these GPUs running continuously for weeks. Multiply that across dozens of models and hundreds of data centers, and the numbers escalate quickly. A traditional data center rack might use around 8 kilowatts (kW) of power. An AI-optimized rack using GPUs can demand 45-55 kW or more. Multiply that across an entire building or campus of racks, and the difference is staggering.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Cooling all that hardware adds another layer of energy demand. Keeping AI servers from overheating accounts for 30-55% of a data center's total power use. Advanced cooling methods like liquid immersion are helping, but scaling those across the industry will take time.",
      "On the upside, AI researchers are developing more efficient ways to run these systems. One promising approach is the \"mixture of experts\" model architecture, which activates only a portion of the full model for each task. This method can significantly reduce the amount of energy required without sacrificing performance.",
      "How much power are we talking about?",
      "In 2023, global data centers consumed about 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. That is enough to power every home in California, Texas and Florida combined for an entire year. By 2030, the number could triple, with AI as the main driver.",
      "To put it into perspective, the average home uses about 30 kilowatt-hours per day. One terawatt-hour is a billion times larger than a kilowatt-hour. That means 1 TWh could power 33 million homes for a day.",
      "Data center\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 AI TERMS YOU KEEP HEARING AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEAN",
      "AI\u2019s energy demand is outpacing the power grid",
      "The demand for AI is growing faster than the energy grid can adapt. In the U.S., data center electricity use is expected to surpass 600 TWh by 2030, tripling current levels. Meeting that demand requires the equivalent of adding 14 large power plants to the grid. Large AI data centers can each require 100\u2013500 megawatts (MW), and the largest facilities may soon exceed 1 gigawatt (GW), which is about as much as a nuclear power plant or a small U.S. state. One 1 GW data center could consume more power than the entire city of San Francisco. Multiply that by a few dozen campuses across the country, and you start to see how quickly this demand adds up.",
      "To keep up, utilities across the country are delaying coal plant retirements, expanding natural gas infrastructure and shelving clean energy projects. In states like Utah, Georgia and Wisconsin, energy regulators have approved new fossil fuel investments directly linked to data center growth. By 2035, data centers could account for 8.6% of all U.S. electricity demand, up from 3.5% today.",
      "Despite public pledges to support sustainability, tech companies are inadvertently driving a fossil fuel resurgence. For the average person, this shift could increase electricity costs, strain regional energy supplies and complicate state-level clean energy goals.",
      "Power grid facility\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can big tech keep its green energy promises?",
      "Tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta all claim they are working toward a net-zero emissions future. In simple terms, this means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases they emit with the amount they remove or offset, ideally bringing their net contribution to climate change down to zero.",
      "These companies purchase large amounts of renewable energy to offset their usage and invest in next-generation energy solutions. For example, Microsoft has a contract with fusion start-up Helion to supply clean electricity by 2028.",
      "However, critics argue these clean energy purchases do not reflect the reality on the ground. Because the grid is shared, even if a tech company buys solar or wind power on paper, fossil fuels often fill the gap for everyone else.",
      "Some researchers say this model is more beneficial for company accounting than for climate progress. While the numbers might look clean on a corporate emissions report, the actual energy powering the grid still includes coal and gas.\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Google and\u00a0Amazon have pledged to power their data centers with 100% renewable energy, but because the grid is shared, fossil fuels often fill the gap when renewables aren\u2019t available.",
      "Some critics argue that voluntary pledges alone are not enough. Unlike traditional industries, there is no standardized regulatory framework requiring tech companies to disclose detailed energy usage from AI operations. This lack of transparency makes it harder to track whether green pledges are translating into meaningful action, especially as workloads shift to third-party contractors or overseas operations.",
      "A wind energy farm\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI CYBERSECURITY RISKS AND DEEPFAKE SCAMS ON THE RISE",
      "The future of clean energy for AI and its limits",
      "To meet soaring energy needs without worsening emissions, tech companies are investing in advanced energy projects. These include small nuclear reactors built directly next to data centers, deep geothermal systems and nuclear fusion.",
      "While promising, these technologies face enormous technical and regulatory hurdles. Fusion, for example, has never reached commercial break-even, meaning it has yet to produce more energy than it consumes. Even the most optimistic experts say we may not see scalable fusion before the 2030s.",
      "Beyond the technical barriers, many people have concerns about the safety, cost and long-term waste management of new nuclear systems. While proponents argue these designs are safer and more efficient, public skepticism remains a real hurdle. Community resistance is also a factor. In some regions, proposals for nuclear microreactors or geothermal drilling have faced delays due to concerns over safety, noise and environmental harm. Building new data centers and associated power infrastructure can take up to seven years, due to permitting, land acquisition and construction challenges.",
      "Google recently activated a geothermal project in Nevada, but it only generates enough power for a few thousand homes. The next phase may be able to power a single data center by 2028. Meanwhile, companies like Amazon and Microsoft continue building sites that consume more power than entire citie.",
      "SCAMMERS CAN EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FROM JUST ONE CHATGPT SEARCH",
      "Will AI help or harm the environment?",
      "This is the central debate. Advocates argue that AI could ultimately help accelerate climate progress by optimizing energy grids, modeling emissions patterns and inventing better clean technology. Microsoft and Google have both cited these uses in their public statements. But critics warn that the current trajectory is unsustainable. Without major breakthroughs or stricter policy frameworks, the energy cost of AI may overwhelm climate gains. A recent forecast estimated that AI could add 1.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide to global emissions between 2025 and 2030, roughly 4% more than the entire annual emissions of the U.S.",
      "Water use, rare mineral demand and land-use conflicts are also emerging concerns as AI infrastructure expands. Large data centers often require millions of gallons of water for cooling each year, which can strain local water supplies. The demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements \u2014 used in servers, cooling systems and power electronics \u2014 creates additional pressure on supply chains and mining operations.

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "Hacking keeps evolving, just like any other profession. Cybercriminals are always upgrading their tools, especially malware, to find new ways to scam people and steal data or money. The old tricks no longer work as well. Basic phishing rarely fools anyone twice, so hackers constantly look for new ways to break in.",
      "They rely on whatever grabs your attention and doesn't raise suspicion, things like social media ads, fake banking apps or updates that look completely normal. One of the fastest-growing threats in this space is Crocodilus.",
      "First detected in early 2025, this Android banking Trojan takes over your contact list to make its scams look more legitimate and harder to spot.",

      "Android phone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Crocodilus malware: What Android users must know now",
      "The\u00a0Crocodilus malware was first documented by ThreatFabric cybersecurity researchers in late March 2025. They highlighted its extensive data theft and remote control capabilities.",
      "Crocodilus uses Facebook to infect devices. It appears in ads that look normal, but once clicked, the malware installs itself on your device. In some cases, it mimicked banking and e-commerce apps in Poland, promising users free points in exchange for downloading an app. The link led to a fake site that delivered the malware. Although the ad was only live for a few hours, it still reached thousands of users, most of whom were over 35, a group more likely to have money in the bank.",
      "Smaller but growing campaigns have also been reported in the United States, where Crocodilus disguised itself as crypto wallet tools, mining apps and financial services. These fake apps are often distributed through social media ads or phishing links, targeting Android users who are less likely to question a \"legit-looking\" financial app. While not yet widespread, the presence of Crocodilus in the U.S. underscores its global reach and rapidly evolving tactics.",
      "ANDROID SECURITY UPGRADES OUTSMART SCAMS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY",
      "The Trojan has also been spotted in Spain, where it disguised itself as a browser update, targeting nearly every major Spanish bank. In Turkey, it posed as an online casino app. And the threat doesn't stop there.",
      "One of the biggest concerns with Crocodilus is its ability to add fake contacts to your phone, inserting entries like \"Bank Support\" into your contact list. So, if an attacker calls pretending to be from your bank, your phone may not flag it because it appears to be a trusted number, making social engineering scams much more convincing.",
      "The latest version also includes a more advanced seed phrase collector, especially dangerous for cryptocurrency users. Crocodilus monitors your screen and uses pattern matching to detect and extract sensitive data, such as private keys or recovery phrases, all before quietly sending it to the attacker.",

      "Crocodilus shows us what the next wave of mobile threats might look like. It uses real ads to get into your phone. It blends into your digital life in ways that feel familiar. It does not need flashy tricks to succeed. It just needs to appear trustworthy.",
      "This kind of malware is designed for scale. It targets large groups, works across different regions and updates fast. It can pretend to be a bank, a shopping app or even something harmless like a browser update. The scary part is how normal it all looks. People are not expecting something this malicious to hide inside something that looks like a gift.",
      "The creators of Crocodilus understand how people think and act online. They are using that knowledge to build tools that work quietly and effectively. And they are not working alone. This kind of operation likely involves a network of developers, advertisers and distributors all working together.",

      "7 expert tips to protect your Android from Crocodilus malware",
      "1. Avoid downloading apps from ads or unknown sources: Crocodilus often spreads through ads on social media platforms like Facebook. These ads promote apps that look like banking tools, e-commerce platforms or even crypto wallets. If you click and install one, you might be unknowingly downloading malware. Always search for apps directly on trusted platforms like the Google Play Store. Do not install anything from random links, especially those shared through ads, messages or unfamiliar websites.",
      "2. Avoid suspicious links and install strong antivirus protection: Crocodilus spreads through deceptive ads and fake app links. These can look like legitimate banking tools, crypto apps or browser updates. Clicking on them may quietly install malware that hijacks your contacts, monitors your screen or steals login credentials. To stay safe, avoid clicking on links from unknown sources, especially those that promise rewards or warn of urgent problems. Installing strong antivirus software on your Android device adds another layer of protection. It can scan downloads, block malicious behavior and warn you about phishing attempts before they become a bigger issue.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully before and after installation: Before you install an app, take a moment to look at the permissions it asks for. If a shopping app wants access to your contacts, messages or screen, that is a red flag. After installing, go to your phone settings and double-check what permissions the app actually has. Malware like Crocodilus relies on overreaching permissions to steal data and gain control. If anything seems unnecessary, revoke the access or uninstall the app entirely.",
      "4. Keep your Android device updated at all times: Security patches are released regularly to block known vulnerabilities. Crocodilus is designed to take advantage of outdated systems and bypass newer Android restrictions. By\u00a0updating your phone and apps regularly, you reduce the chances of malware slipping through. Set your device to install updates automatically when possible and check manually every so often if you are not sure.",
      "5. Consider using a data removal or monitoring service:\u00a0While not a direct defense against malware, data removal services can help minimize the damage if your information has already been leaked or sold. These services monitor your personal data on the dark web and offer guidance if your credentials have been compromised. In a case like Crocodilus, where malware may harvest and transmit banking info or crypto keys, knowing your data exposure early can help you act before scammers do.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "6. Turn on Google Play Protect: Google Play Protect is a built-in security feature on Android phones that scans your apps for anything suspicious. To stay protected, make sure it\u2019s turned on. You can check this by opening the Play Store, tapping your profile icon and selecting Play Protect. From there, you can see if it's active and run a manual scan of all your installed apps. While it may not catch everything, especially threats from outside the Play Store, it\u2019s still an important first layer of defense against harmful apps like Crocodilus.",
      "7. Be skeptical of unfamiliar contacts or urgent messages: One of the newer tricks Crocodilus uses is modifying your contact list. It can add fake entries that look like customer service numbers or bank helplines. So, if you receive a call from \"Bank Support,\" it might not be real. Always verify phone numbers through official websites or documents. The same applies to messages asking for personal details or urgent logins. When in doubt, do not respond or click any links. Contact your bank or service provider directly.",
      "DON\u2019T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Crocodilus is one of the most advanced Android banking Trojans seen so far. It spreads through social media ads, hides inside apps that look real and collects sensitive data like banking passwords and crypto seed phrases. It can also add fake contacts to your phone to trick you during scam calls. If you use Android, avoid downloading apps from links in ads or messages. Only install apps from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. Keep your phone updated, and be careful if something looks too good to be true because it probably is.",

Everyone has seen both men and women that by looking at that person, you say, \u2018oh, I don\u2019t want to try that person, they'd be too much of a fight.' You've just won. You've psychologically defeated them before they even attempted, and that's a victory. That's deterrence. Avoiding bad.\"",

      "The bottom line is trusting your gut.",
      "\"Listen to your intuition,\" he said. \"If there's a reason you paid attention to it and a reason you noted it, guess what? That's an anomaly. And if you're not comfortable investigating it further, make sure you tell somebody who is, and you can't just let it go.\"",

That has consumed huge resources across the FBI field and at HQ and at DOJ.\u201d",

      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who arrived in Congress in 1997 and voted against authorizing military force in Iraq in 2002, said he also saw parallels between the escalating Iran situation and how the George W. Bush administration made the case for the Iraq War.",
      "\"I remember how they cherry-picked information and fed it to members of Congress, but at least we had a debate,\" said McGovern, the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, who is calling for a formal debate and vote on military action against Iran. \"It's easy to get into wars; it's hard as hell to get out.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she hopes Democrats can, at minimum, rally around the Kaine resolution to require approval from Congress before Trump can strike Iran.",
      "\"People can argue all they want about what the election of 2024 meant,\" Warren said. \"But the one thing I'm very sure about is that no one was voting to attack another nation and involve America's military in another war.\"",
      "But that unity isn't there. Jeffries declined to say Monday whether he supports the Khanna resolution to require Congress to sign off on military action in Iran, telling reporters, \u201cI haven\u2019t taken a look at it.\u201d",
      "And Fetterman, who urged Trump last week to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, pushed back against fellow Democrats who have labeled U.S. military involvement \u201cunconstitutional\u201d or who called for Trump to be impeached.",
      "\u201cIf you throw that word around \u2014 \u2018impeachment\u2019 \u2014 then you continue to cheapen what that word actually means,\u201d Fetterman told reporters Monday.",
      "\u201cI was the first guy in the Senate calling it to strike the nuclear facilities. Of course, I absolutely support that,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, I know that might cost me politically, but I fundamentally know that\u2019s right.\u201d",

      "It had nothing to do with Iran.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s America: The father of 3 U.S. Marines is brutally beaten by federal agents,\u201d Newsom said on X, speaking of an immigration arrest in his state that was caught on a viral video.",
      "Absent from Newsom\u2019s typically active and animated feed were any verbal shots at Trump\u2019s strikes on Iran, even though he is among the governors viewed as potential 2028 contenders who has repeatedly taken on Trump.",
      "But after one of the most consequential moves Trump has taken since he became commander in chief in January, he and other governors kept quiet about the United States\u2019 potentially entering a war.",
      "Aides to various governors said they tried to stay in their lanes \u2014 speaking specifically about how they were protecting their states from any potential retribution through violence or cyberattacks or by honoring National Guard members based in the Middle East. They stressed they weren\u2019t privy to intelligence that would have helped assess Trump\u2019s decision to order strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities; they couldn\u2019t even independently assess after the fact how much damage was actually done.",
      "Among those who spoke more substantively about the issue was Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who steered the focus to Trump if there were retaliation to the United States\u2019 strikes.",
      "\u201cObviously, the Trump Administration holds responsibility for what comes next and ensuring that our American troops and our personnel in the region are safe,\u201d Shapiro said Sunday on X. He made sure to condemn an Iranian possession of nuclear materials.",
      "\u201cI will say, with regard to the Iranian nuclear program, it was obviously very, very dangerous,\" Shapiro said. \"The idea that Iran, the world\u2019s largest sponsor of terror, would have a nuclear weapon, would not only destabilize the Middle East, but it would create risk for American interests at home and abroad. And so it is good if Iran does not possess a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Newsom did post a message later Monday honoring the 205 California Guard members serving in the Middle East, including at bases in Qatar and Iraq. \u201cJen and I are praying for their safety \u2014 and for the safety of every American service member serving in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he wrote, referring to his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul outlined what she had done to assess potential threats in a video on social media. \u201cAs we know, New York is always a target,\u201d she said, noting that she convened her public safety team as soon as she heard of Trump\u2019s strike authorization. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has repeatedly railed against Trump on other occasions, had a measured response Saturday, writing on X that after an \"escalation in Iran, I\u2019m keeping a close eye in consultation with federal authorities and @ILStatePolice.\"",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear wrote at the time of the retaliatory attacks Monday, without specifying what he was referring to: \u201cI know things seem scary right now, but it\u2019s important to take care of yourself.

      "Oil prices jumped and stock futures slipped Sunday evening, indicating concern among investors about the possibility of economic fallout from the ongoing unrest in the Middle East following U.S. strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "The major focus is on oil. Iran remains a major international oil supplier, and it also sits on the Strait of Hormuz, a heavily trafficked waterway in the Persian Gulf that is a key transit channel for about one-fifth of the world\u2019s oil supply.",
      "Concerns centered on whether Iran would begin limiting or shutting down access to the strait. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that closing the strait would be tantamount to \u201ceconomic suicide\u201d for Iran and called on China, Iran\u2019s top trading partner, to head off any attempt by Iran to affect traffic.",
      "U.S. and global oil benchmark prices opened up 4% Sunday evening, underscoring the concerns about what the conflict means for the world\u2019s oil supplies. Those gains had eased slightly by 9 p.m. Sunday. Oil prices already gained about 3% last week in the wake of Israel\u2019s initial strikes against Iranian targets and Iran\u2019s retaliatory missile attacks.",
      "Stocks also slid Sunday. S&P 500 futures contracts opened about 0.6% in the first hour of trading, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell about 250 points, or 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.7%. Like oil, they had pared those opening losses somewhat by 9 p.m. U.S. markets officially open at 9:30 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "\u201cShould oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz be affected, we could easily see $100 oil\u201d or an increase in U.S. gas prices by 75 cents per gallon, Andy Lipow, president of the consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates, said in a note to clients Sunday.",
      "In a worst-case scenario in which oil prices rose to at least $120 a barrel, U.S. gas prices would increase as much as $1.25 per gallon, Lipow said.",
      "In a follow-up email, Lipow said that even if the strait does not officially close, any action by a tanker company to pre-emptively reduce its footprint there represents \u201da de facto supply disruption.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s state-owned media reported that Iran\u2019s parliament backed closing the strait \u2014 but that the final decision lies with Iran\u2019s national security council, according to the report.",
      "Any move by Iran to alter traffic in the strait could also hurt its own economy \u2014 particularly commerce with China.",
      "On Sunday, a department of the U.K. Royal Navy said it observed \u201celectronic interference in the Strait of Hormuz.\u201d At least two massive supertankers that had entered the strait were reported to have made U-turns. Marine tracking websites also showed the vessels turning about halfway through the strait.",
      "\u201cI encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Straits of Hormuz for their oil,\u201d Rubio said in an interview on Fox News. China is Iran\u2019s most important oil customer, and they maintain friendly relations.",
      "Iran may still be assessing the ultimate damage to its nuclear facilities as it contemplates its next move. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Sunday that while it had confirmed that the Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan sites had been hit, it was not immediately possible to assess the damage at the Fordo site.",
      "Until last week, U.S. stocks had been enjoying a substantial, if volatile, recovery from the lows following President Donald Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs announcement in April. That momentum reversed after Israel announced last weekend it had struck key Iranian military and nuclear targets, prompting retaliatory missile strikes on Israeli targets by Iran.",
      "JPMorgan analysts said Sunday that investors had voiced concerns to them last week that the Iran-Israel conflict would spread, \u201cand those concerns have been materialized.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s statement that this might be the only US attack or might begin a series of attacks brought us little certainty,\u201d the analysts added in a note to clients. \u201cMoreover, we do not see an obvious route to a political settlement to the military conflict, which makes us think the conflict, like the one in Gaza, could last longer than many investors think.\u201d",
      "Year to date, the S&P 500 is up less than 2%."

    "story": [
      "A top official at the Justice Department told subordinates they would need to consider ignoring court orders the day before the administration carried out deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, according to a department whistleblower.",
      "In a letter sent to Congress by his attorneys, Erez Reuveni said he and others were told by Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove in very blunt terms that they might have to defy court orders.",
      "Bove told attendees of the March 14 meeting that President Donald Trump would soon be invoking the Alien Enemies Act and that deportations would be carried out that weekend.",
      "\"Bove indicated these removals were a priority for the administration and stressed to all in attendance that the planes needed to take off no matter what,\" according to the letter from Reuveni's attorneys at the Government Accountability Project. A copy of the letter, which was first reported on by The New York Times, was obtained by NBC News.",
      "\"Bove then made a remark concerning the possibility that a court order would enjoin those removals before they could be effectuated. Bove stated that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts 'f--- you' and ignore any such court order,\" according to the letter.",
      "Reuveni said he was \"stunned\" by the remarks, but left the meeting reassured after another attendee said the DOJ would tell the administration to comply with court orders.",
      "Now that disbelief \"is a relic of a different time,\" the letter says, and Reuveni was involved in three separate cases where the DOJ ignored court orders and made misrepresentations in court before he was fired in April.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche blasted the Times article in a post on X, and said it \"describes falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee and then leaked to the press in violation of ethical obligations. The claims about Department of Justice leadership and the Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General are utterly false.\"",
      "The letter was sent one day before Bove \u2014 who along with Blanche represented Trump in his criminal and civil cases before he won the presidential election in November \u2014 has a confirmation hearing for a lifetime appointment to a federal appeals court.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Senior adviser Stephen Miller blasted Reuveni as a \"saboteur\" and a \"Democrat\" during an April 14 interview on Fox News, allegations the letter pushes back on. Reuveni noted in his letter that he been promoted on the day of the Bove meeting, and had won awards for his legal work during Trump's first term in office.",
      "His whistleblower complaint outlines what it calls \"violations of law, rules or regulations, and the abuse of authority by DOJ and White House personnel.\"",
      "\"These high-level governmental personnel knowingly and willfully defied court orders, directed their subordinate attorneys to make misrepresentations to courts, and engaged in a scheme to withhold relevant information from the court to advance the Administration\u2019s priority of deporting noncitizens,\" the complaint says.",
      "The first instance was the day after the Bove meeting, when U.S. District Judge James Boasberg called an emergency hearing after a lawsuit was filed claiming that alleged gang members were set to be deported under the Alien Enemies Act without any due process.",
      "At the Saturday hearing, Boasberg asked DOJ attorney Drew Ensign if he was aware of any deportation flights that weekend, and Ensign said he was not. In his letter, Reuveni said Ensign was in the meeting where Bove said those flights were indeed happening.",
      "After Boasberg issued an order halting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act and directing the flights to return, Reuveni said he sent emails to Homeland Security and the State Department informing them of the order and got no response.",
      "Representatives for DHS and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Reuveni said he later learned that Bove \"had advised DHS that under the court order it was permissible to deplane individuals on the flights that departed U.S. airspace\" before the judge's order was officially entered on the docket.",
      "After the judge demanded answers about what had happened, Reuveni was informed that the \"government was not going to answer the court\u2019s questions about anything that happened before 7:26 p.m. on March 15.\"",
      "The judge last month found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in contempt over the deportation flights.",
      "Reuveni said the department also ignored court orders in another deportation case, where a judge had issued an injunction barring deportees from being sent to countries they did not come from. He said he informed DHS to prepare guidance to tell staffers those deportations were to be halted nationwide, and was told by a DHS attorney they'd heard otherwise.",
      "When Reuveni asked a DHS lawyer what the issue was, he said he was told, \"Ask your leadership.\" He said he was later told by a colleague to stop asking questions and putting things in writing.",
      "Reuveni was fired in early April, after he acknowledged in court that one deportee, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, had been sent to a prison in El Salvador despite a court order barring him from being sent there.",
      "\"[D]espite the high-profile nature of the case, Mr. Reuveni initially believed the case could be resolved through a straightforward return of Mr. Abrego Garcia to the United States,\" the letter says.",
      "Attorneys for \"both DHS and DOS informed Mr. Reuveni that they would only consider any action to attempt to remedy the illegal removal of Mr. Abrego Garcia if DOJ leadership approved it. DOJ leadership never did,\" it says.",
      "Reuveni said he was then pressed to say in court filings that Abrego was a \"terrorist\" and he refused to do so, because he wasn't aware of any evidence to substantiate that claim. He said he told his boss, \"I didn't sign up to lie.\"",
      "He was placed on administrative leave seven hours later for \"failure to follow a directive\" and then fired on April 11.",
      "Abrego was returned to the U.S. this month and hit with human trafficking charges."

      "Daniel Park, the Washington man who was charged with providing large amounts of chemicals used in a car bomb outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, last month, died Tuesday in federal custody, the Justice Department said.",
      "Park, 32, was found unresponsive at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, the Justice Department said. He was taken to the facility on June 13 after he was indicted and charged with malicious destruction of property.",
      "\"Responding employees initiated life-saving measures,\" the Justice Department said. \"Emergency medical services (EMS) were requested while life-saving efforts continued.\"",
      "Park was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, the Justice Department said. Officials, who did not reveal the cause of death, said the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service were notified.",
      "\"No employees or other incarcerated individuals were injured and at no time was the public in danger,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Park, of Kent, Washington, was arrested in Poland last month after he traveled there following the May 17 car bombing outside the American Reproductive Centers clinic in Palm Springs. He was taken to the United States, where he was charged with providing and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist, federal prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Park supplied 270 pounds of ammonium nitrate, an explosive precursor commonly used to construct homemade bombs, to Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, the primary suspect in the bombing. Bartkus, of Twentynine Palms, California, was killed in the attack, and four other people were injured.",
      "Officials said the bombing was an \u201cintentional act of terrorism.\u201d Bartkus was motivated by anti-natalist ideology, pro-mortalism and anti-abortion ideology, prosecutors said, and Park was alleged to share similar views, according to Akil Davis, the assistant director of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office.",
      "Investigators said that after the bombing, they learned that Park spent two weeks visiting Bartkus in Twentynine Palms from Jan. 25 to Feb. 8, \u201crunning experiments in Bartkus\u2019 garage.\u201d Park had already sent shipments of ammonium nitrate to Bartkus in January, before his visit, authorities said.",
      "A search warrant in Seattle also found that Park had \u201can explosive recipe that was similar\u201d to the explosive used the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, Davis said.",
      "\u201cWe believe that Park had knowledge of how to create an ammonium nitrate-fueled bomb,\u201d Davis said this month. \u201cSocial media posts indicate that he was attempting to recruit others of like-minded ideology and discuss these things on internet forums.\u201d",
      "The attack damaged the clinic building and left a 250-yard debris field. No one who worked at the clinic was hurt, and the center\u2019s lab \u2014 which houses eggs, embryos and reproductive materials \u2014 was not damaged, according to the clinic."

      "The Emerson College/WPIX/The Hill survey shows former Gov. Andrew Cuomo leading state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani 36% to 34% in the initial first-choice count, with Mamdani eventually overtaking Cuomo after multiple rounds of ranked choice tabulation and winning the final tally 52% to 48%.",

      "One of those polls may be a lot more accurate than the other, although there is room for both to be right, since Marist\u2019s was taken a week earlier and the race could have shifted in that time.",
      "The composition of the electorate is uncertain, too. Both Emerson and Marist find that Cuomo has an advantage with voters who said they would cast ballots in person Tuesday, as opposed to taking part in early voting or voting by mail. But will those voters show up in the numbers pollsters expect? It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 to talk about how crucial turnout is as a variable, but there it is.",
      "Moreover, ranked choice voting is still new to New York City; this is only the second mayoral contest since it was implemented. It\u2019s still uncommon elsewhere. So no polling outlet has a deep and well-established track record when it comes to measuring such races.

      "Sherman was a squeaky-clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunchboxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "A life-changing Hollywood party",
      "Sherman, with sky blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high-school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "From music to medicine",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "The teen idols grow up",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon wrote: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health, and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",
      "\"Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was \u2014 brave, gentle, and full of light,\" Poublon wrote."

      "Disney+'s ill-fated \"Lizzie McGuire\" reboot remains a sore spot for many who rooted for the continuation of the early aughts series.",
      "When Jake Thomas, the actor who played the mischievous younger brother to the show\u2019s titular character, found out that the revival officially got canceled in 2020, he took it as a sign.",
      "\"I have a theory: to a certain degree, the show is cursed,\" the 35-year-old actor said during a June 14 interview on \"Zach Sang Show Clips.\" During the episode, Thomas reflected on the series and its several brushes with revitalization.",
      "For two seasons, Thomas appeared as Matt McGuire and appeared alongside Hilary Duff in the Disney Channel original series that aired from 2001 to 2004. The show inspired the 2003 film \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie,\u201d which had a theatrical release.",
      "\u201cBecause this is not the first time we\u2019ve tried to do a continuation of the show,\u201d he explained. \"Originally, we were going to do, after the original run on Disney Channel, they were going to put us on prime time ABC.\"",

      "Season 2 of the popular Netflix series, which aired June 18, shows several members of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders stepping up to push for more livable wages.",
      "In light of the success of Season 1, some DCC members were emboldened to start a conversation with management about their pay, explaining their effort to make compensation better for future generations of cheerleaders.",

      "The 36 women who end up on the team appear to spend hours at dance rehearsals, volunteering around Dallas, Texas, and performing at games. At one point in the docuseries, the cheerleaders\u2019 coaching staff said that the dancers typically clock an 11-hour day on game days.",
      "But the show also revealed that most of the women work an additional full-time job, on top of being a Cowboys cheerleader. In their introduction, some of the cheerleaders said they worked jobs as doctors, nurses, accountants, fitness instructors and more.",
      "How Much Do NFL Cheerleaders Make?",
      "In 2024, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d director and executive producer Greg Whiteley told Glamour that he never received a \u201cclean answer\u201d on the cheerleaders\u2019 wages.",

      "In a follow-up video Puryear shared to TikTok in June 2024, she explained that, when she was on the team, the cheerleaders were paid a flat fee for games, in addition to an hourly rate.",
      "For public appearances, cheerleaders were also paid an hourly rate and flat fee, but tenure played a role in that amount, she said in the video. Because many of the women work another job, Puryear said the public appearances were not required. She added that for practices, the athletes are solely compensated an hourly rate.",
      "\u201cSo all in all, it\u2019s a full-time commitment, part-time pay,\u201d she said at the time.",
      "As seen in the docuseries, DCC members also score several perks as part of their roles, including meal prep services, gym memberships, beauty services (tanning, nails, makeup, hair, skincare, etc.), products, dental treatments and more.",
      "NBC Sports Boston reported in 2022 that NFL cheerleaders make, on average, about $150 per game. The athletes were reportedly also making about $50 to $75 for public appearances at the time, which altogether equated to about $22,500 per year.",
      "However, pay differs among teams. The outlet reported that Dallas\u2019 cheerleaders in 2022 were making about $15-20 per hour, which, with game and public appearance fees, totaled to about $75,000 a year.",
      "Per old footage in the Netflix docuseries, the cheerleaders were, at one point, making $15 per game. However, in interviews with former cheerleaders, some said they were \u201csurprised (the Cowboys) paid anything,\u201d calling their job an \u201chonorary position.\u201d",
      "Former cheerleader Tina Kalina, who was on the team in the 1980s, said in the docuseries that she made $35 per game.",
      "\u201cThese millennials, X-Gen, whatever they\u2019re called, they do look at it as a job, whereas us old-timers look at it as more of a privilege,\u201d she said.",

      "In the show, the group pushing for change consults with outside legal sources and meets with management, neither of which initially lead to changes. The team considers a walkout to protest the pay, which falls through. Many still debate not turning in their contracts unless changes are made.",
      "In the season finale, however, the athletes receive great news: management has approved a 400% pay increase.",

      "What has DCC said about pay?",
      "In regards to the increased salaries revealed at the end of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d Season 2, the Cowboys told NBC News in a statement June 18, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased, as you\u2019ll see in the series, that the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders were happy with the outcome.\u201d",
      "Charlotte Jones, Cowboys\u2019 chief brand officer and daughter of team owner Jerry Jones, addressed the cheerleaders\u2019 pay in Season 1 of the docuseries.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cynicism around pay for NFL cheerleaders \u2014 and as it should be. They\u2019re not paid a lot,\u201d Jones said in the first season. \u201cBut the facts are that they actually don\u2019t come here for the money. They come here for something that\u2019s actually bigger than that to them.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey have a passion for dance,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere are not a lot of opportunities in the field of dance to get to perform at an elite level.

      "Lavender, a TV writer and producer, and Shores, who works in communications, tell TODAY.com they landed on the idea for what would become \u201cHappy Wife\u201d after what they describe as a \"meet-cute\" at their children\u2019s school.",
      "\u201cIn classic Atlanta fashion, we couldn\u2019t find a parking space, so my husband, my daughter and I blow in probably 10 minutes late,\u201d Shores says. \u201cI don\u2019t think Meredith\u2019s ever been 10 minutes late to anything in her life. She\u2019s there, her son is seated, my daughter sits down next to him, I\u2019m sweating.\u201d",
      "The kids had been tasked with completing a scavenger hunt while waiting for everyone to arrive, and Shores says she started panicking thinking her child wouldn\u2019t have enough time to find things.",

      "It was at a book fair where Shores mustered up the strength to ask Lavender about her career in writing and producing for TV, and a few months later, she approached her with an idea for a book.",
      "\u201cI had an idea in mind, sort of loosely inspired by the way that we, at the time, were all obsessed with the Murdaugh murders,\u201d Shores says. \u201cAnd you could see the way that, in a small town in South Carolina, the way that lore and history and lineage in that community shapes a crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor me, growing up in Winter Park, which has its own lore and its own kind of energy, I just couldn\u2019t stop picturing what would it would be like if that happened in Winter Park,\u201d she adds.",
      "Lavender says that after Shores pitched her the idea, her brain went into \u201chyperdrive.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it was just lightning in a bottle, you know? It\u2019s that moment in time where, like, right idea, right person and then right moment,\u201d Lavender says. \u201cSo I think for us, it was a really fun process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d crack each other up. We\u2019d text each other, she would send me, like, a copy of the chapter, and I would be reading, texting her, like, \u2018Ha ha, this line!\u2019 or, like, screengrabs of it,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd I think we both did that for each other all the way through.\u201d",
      "The pair wrote the book together over the course of a few months. Shores summarizes the book: \u201cA young woman falls in love with a man who is older than her and his friends don\u2019t approve of the courtship or the marriage, so she throws a party in the hopes of winning them over, and the morning after the party, he\u2019s missing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis book, too, is about choice. These are people who just keep choosing their choice, doing it. I think that\u2019s the fascinating thing,\u201d Shores adds.",
      "The authors hint at what may be coming after the release, including a possible TV adaptation (\"For me, obviously, it's a no-brainer,\" Lavender says) and potentially more books, including with characters from the Winter Park universe.",
      "Recalling when they found out Jenna had chosen their book, Shores and Lavender say there was a lot of squealing.",
      "\u201cTo have the opportunity to even have a book on a shelf somewhere, like, I\u2019ll be able to take my daughter to a bookstore and point at something and say, \u2018We made this. It\u2019s possible to make whatever you want,\u2019\u201d Shores says. \u201cAnd so for Jenna to see it and like it and to give it this extra platform is like, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d",

      "When two new bombshells, TJ and Andreina, enter the villa, the rest of the islanders are stoked to get to know them. Jeremiah is making efforts to bounce back after ending things with Huda, and his connection with Iris seems promising. Andreina catches his eye, though, and those feelings are mutual as the two continue to chat and share kisses. Jeremiah and Iris eventually agree that their connection isn\u2019t so strong anyway and decide to stay friends.",

      "As TJ chats up a few girls in the villa, some bright connections emerge. He hits it off with Iris, as well as Cierra, who is happily coupled with Nic \u2014 or so we thought.",
      "Though Cierra jives with TJ, she and Nic just slept together for the first time the night before. But, after a rowdy challenge earlier in the day that made clear Nic is attracted to Andreina, she\u2019s thinks her feelings may be stronger than his. She chats with Nic, seeking a bit of affirmation, but Nic doesn\u2019t exactly deliver. He likes Andreina too, he says, and wants to stay open.",
      "Meanwhile, there\u2019s little trouble with the rest of the islanders: Chelley and Ace, Hannah and Pepe, and Olandria and Taylor seem strong in their couples. Austin and Amaya are newly together, but Austin is concerned Amaya is coming on too strong. Huda, still single after the whole Jeremiah saga, sets her sights on TJ, though he tells her he\u2019s not feeling it.",

The new bombshells, Andreina and TJ, are not included.",

      "\u201cWe were assuming that the damage was going to be much more significant than this assessment is finding,\u201d said one of the three sources. \u201cThis assessment is already finding that these core pieces are still intact. That\u2019s a bad sign for the overall program.\u201d",

      "Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC on Monday that \u201cit will be a good, long time before we know, if we ever learn, whether we were able to actually destroy the stocks of 60% enriched uranium.\u201d",

Our massive bombs hit exactly the right spot at each target\u2014and worked perfectly. The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission.\"",

Grossi confirmed that Natanz and Isfahan were hit and that the entrances to tunnels used to store enriched material appeared to have been hit.",

At the core of it, she said, the focus is \u201cself-determination for the people of Iran.\u201d",

      "\u201cI am aware of the ugliness of war. I have friends in Iran who I am worried for, because there has been collateral damage even with precise strikes, and my biggest fear is some superficial negotiation that keeps Khamenei in power,\u201d Efraim said. \u201cFor the sake of Iranians and Jews around the world, both of whom have been targets of the Islamic regime and its proxies, we must seize this moment and make regime change.\u201d",

      "On Monday, Iran fired back at the U.S. with a strike on the American Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, in what is already being seen as merely a face-saving gesture. Qatar said it had intercepted the Iranian missiles and condemned the attack, calling it a violation of its sovereignty.",
      "But even as Middle Eastern leaders were quick to criticize President Donald Trump\u2019s paradigm-shifting assault on Iran following 10 days of Israeli bombardment, the American strikes are likely to be accepted \u2014 and even privately cheered \u2014 by an Arab officialdom that has long seen Shia Iran as the primary threat to regional stability.",
      "\u201cThese countries are quietly delighted to see Iran cut down to size,\u201d said Firas Maksad, the managing director for the Middle East and North Africa at the Eurasia Group. \u201cBut the primary objective is to guard against blowback targeting them.\u201d",
      "Statements from the governments of Turkey and Saudi Arabia, for example, have stopped short of condemning the U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, instead only issuing expressions of concern over an expanding regional conflict.",

      "The major focus is on oil. Iran remains a major international oil supplier, and it also sits on the Strait of Hormuz, a heavily trafficked waterway in the Persian Gulf that is a key transit channel for about one-fifth of the world\u2019s oil supply.",
      "Concerns centered on whether Iran would begin limiting or shutting down access to the strait. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that closing the strait would be tantamount to \u201ceconomic suicide\u201d for Iran and called on China, Iran\u2019s top trading partner, to head off any attempt by Iran to affect traffic.",

      "Iran may still be assessing the ultimate damage to its nuclear facilities as it contemplates its next move. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Sunday that while it had confirmed that the Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan sites had been hit, it was not immediately possible to assess the damage at the Fordo site.",
      "Until last week, U.S. stocks had been enjoying a substantial, if volatile, recovery from the lows following President Donald Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs announcement in April.

      "Baskaran added that the imports from Myanmar are also particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, which are generally less abundant in the earth\u2019s crust, elevating their value and scarcity.",
      "\u201cMyanmar\u2019s production has significantly strengthened China\u2019s dominant position, effectively giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain \u2014 and much of the leverage it wields today.\u201d",
      "The country has become a key source of two highly sought-after heavy rare earths, dysprosium and terbium, that play crucial roles in high-tech manufacturing, including in defense and the military, aerospace and renewables sectors.",
      "\u201cThis dynamic has given rise to a supply chain in which extraction is concentrated in Myanmar, while downstream processing and value addition are predominantly carried out in China,\u201d said Baskaran.",
      "Why Myanmar?",
      "Myanmar is home to deposits that tend to have higher heavy rare earth content, David Merriman, research director at Project Blue, told CNBC.",
      "These \u201cionic adsorption clay,\u201d or IAC, deposits are exploited through leaching methods that apply chemical reagents to the clay \u2014 and that comes with high environmental costs.",
      "According to Merriman, the vast majority of the world\u2019s IAC operations were in Southern China in the early to mid-2010s. But, as Beijing began implementing new environmental controls and standards in the rare earths industry, many of these projects began to close down.",
      "\u201cMyanmar, particularly the north of the country, was seen as a key region which had similar geology to many of the IAC deposit areas within China,\u201d Merriman said.",

      "In 2024, a report from Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on environmental and human rights abuses, said that China had effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar \u201cat a terrible cost to the environment and local communities.\u201d",

      "China\u2019s reliance on Myanmar for rare earths has also opened it up to supply chain risks, experts said.",
      "According to Global Witness\u2019s research, most of the heavy rare earths from Myanmar originate from the Northern Kachin State, which borders China. However, following Myanmar\u2019s violent military coup in 2021, the military junta has struggled to maintain control of the territory amid opposition from the public and armed groups.",
      "\u201cMyanmar is a risky jurisdiction to rely on, given the ongoing civil war. In 2024, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), a group of armed rebels, seized sites responsible for half the world\u2019s heavy rare earths production,\u201d said CSIS\u2019 Baskaran.",
      "Since the seizure, there have been reports of supply disruptions causing spikes in the prices of some heavy rare earths. According to a Reuters report, the KIA was seeking to use the resources as leverage against Beijing.",
      "Chinese customs data shows imports of rare earth oxides from Myanmar fell by over a third in the first five months of the year compared with the same period last year.",
      "\u201cIf Myanmar were to cease all exports of rare earth feed stocks to China, China would struggle to meet its demand for heavy rare earths in the short term,\u201d said Project Blue\u2019s Merriman.",
      "Not surprisingly, Beijing has been looking to diversify its sources of heavy rare earths.",
      "According to Merriman, there are IAC deposits in nearby countries, including Malaysia and Laos, where some projects have been set up with Chinese involvement.",
      "Still, he notes that environmental standards are expected to be higher in those countries, which will present challenges for rare earth miners.",
      "China\u2019s decision to cut back on its own extraction of heavy rare earth elements may serve as a warning to other countries about the costs of developing such projects. A report by Chinese media group Caixin in 2022 documented how former IAC operation sites in Southern China had left behind toxic water and contaminated soil, hurting local farmers\u2019 livelihoods."

      "\u201cTo see that, one, we actually want to go after a female record, that\u2019s exciting,\u201d said Shalaya Kipp, a former Olympic distance runner and NCAA champion who co-authored the study. \u201cIt\u2019s going to not only draw more females to the sport, but it\u2019s also going to help draw more attention to female physiology and get more research done on females too.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not the runner in me, but that\u2019s the scientist in me that gets really excited if we have this. Scientists are going to start working with more female athletes, and that is a big gap we have right now,\u201d Kipp added.",
      "As experts in physiology and kinesiology, Kram, Kipp and their study\u2019s co-authors, Edson Soares da Silva and Wouter Hoogkamer, were already fans of running. But their pursuit of whether a female sub-four mile was possible began in earnest in 2023 while watching Kipyegon run her 4:07 world record while using pacers for only half the race.",
      "\u201cIt really stood out to us that this was a very fast race \u2014 a world record, of course \u2014 but she had terrible drafting,\u201d said Kipp, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWe\u2019re track nerds, and we watched that, and we\u2019re like, \u2018Well, what if? What if?\u2019 And then we were like, \u2018We actually could do that math.\u2019\u201d",
      "The researchers\u2019 sub-four findings were modeled on a scenario in which Kipyegon would draft off a team of all-female pacers, in part for the gender-breaking symbolism it would represent, Kipp said. In that scenario, the study found that if Kipyegon could stay within about 40 inches behind a pacer in front of her, and 40 inches in front of another behind her \u2014 with a new pacing team swapping in halfway through \u2014 it would create an aerodynamic \u201cpocket\u201d in which she would face the least wind resistance.",
      "Under those conditions, Kipyegon could run 3:59.37, the paper concluded \u2014 the exact time run by Roger Bannister in 1954 when he, using pacers for more than 80% of the race, became the first person to ever break the sub-four barrier.",
      "Less remembered is that also in 1954, Diane Leather became the first woman to break the five-minute barrier in the mile. It took more than half a century for the idea of a woman running a sub-four mile to enter the realm of possibility, however, as training, times and technology all improved.",
      "An inflection point arrived in 2016.",
      "That year, Nike became the first shoe company to combine an exceptionally bouncy new foam with rigid \u201cplates\u201d in its shoes and spikes. Studies have determined such \u201csupershoes\u201d require less effort to run at a given pace by absorbing the impact from each foot strike, allowing runners to rebound more quickly. The breakthrough led Nike to design a different moon shot race, dubbed \u201cBreaking2,\u201d in which Kenyan superstar Eliud Kipchoge attempted to become the first person to run a marathon in less than two hours. He came up 25 seconds short during his first try, in 2017. In his second attempt, three years later, Kipchoge ran 1:59.40. The times do not count as an official world record because the carefully tailored attempt did not meet the standards of the sport\u2019s global governing body, but it represented a seismic shift in what was possible all the same.",
      "It was also a sign of things to come.",
      "\u201cWe opened the 2016 floodgates,\u201d Kipp said, \u201cand we saw these times dropping.\u201d",
      "Of the 50 fastest miles run by women all time, 33 have been run since 2016, including 10 of the top 11. The world record of 4:12.56 had stood since 1996 until Sifan Hassan ran 0.23 seconds faster in 2019. Four years later, Kipyegon shattered Hassan\u2019s world record by a stunning 4.69 seconds in Monaco.",
      "In Paris this week, Kipyegon will wear custom-made Nike supershoe spikes as well as a speed suit and custom bra designed to reduce drag. Kipyegon is unique in that her stride appears effortless, as if floating, Kipp said. Yet what matters most, Kram and Kipp said, is whether Kipyegon has improved at staying tucked in behind her pacers.",
      "Nike did not consult with Kram, Kipp or their research team on the technical details of Kipyegon\u2019s attempt. How the sportswear giant will handle the number and gender of the pacers has led to significant intrigue. Stadiums hosting professional meets feature a metal \u201crail\u201d on the inside of the first lane, separating the track from the infield. Because Paris\u2019 Stade Charlety has little rubberized track surface inside of the rail, it\u2019s unlikely it will have the space needed to use the type of \u201cfull arrowhead\u201d formation it employed in its attempt to help Kipchoge break two hours in the marathon. Kram wonders if Nike will employ a \u201chalf arrowhead\u201d or perhaps even the model the researchers studied, with one in front and one behind.",
      "He and Kipp will also be watching for how Kipyegon and her pacers line up at the start; how relaxed she appears while pushing an unprecedented pace; and, nearing the finish, when the pacers will peel away to allow Kipyegon to finish alone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be watching to make sure that she\u2019s in the pocket, and that the pacers don\u2019t get too excited,\u201d Kram said. \u201cIn the first 200 [meters] you can ruin your chances for the mile. If she goes out and runs 27 [seconds], she\u2019s cooked. She\u2019s got to go out in 29, 29-high.",
      "\u201cIf she comes through 1,200 in three minutes, I think she\u2019s going to get it. Other people are saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s when she\u2019s going to die.\u2019 But I believe in our numbers and our calculations.\u201d",
      "Kipchoge and his training partners wore T-shirts featuring \u201cBreaking4\u201d and Kipyegon\u2019s image during training recently.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an honor for us to support [Kipyegon] as she prepares to achieve the unthinkable and to break down the barriers of human performance,\u201d Kipchoge wrote on Instagram. \u201cFaith is a true inspiration for our world. If there\u2019s one person to do it, it is you. Go for it!\u201d",
      "The race also comes at a significant moment for Nike itself. The company\u2019s roots are in running \u2014 it was founded by a middle-distance runner, Phil Knight, and his collegiate track coach \u2014 and more runners finished distance races in 2024 wearing the brand than any other, according to an industry group survey. In recent years, however, Nike\u2019s shelf space and market share among running shoes has been challenged by newcomers such as Hoka and On. Kipyegon\u2019s sub-four attempt will come on the same day that Nike is scheduled to host a quarterly earnings call.",
      "In the days before Kipyegon\u2019s race, Kram acknowledged having nerves over how the study\u2019s findings would fare in a real-life test. Many of his previous studies had received scant attention from the wider public, he said. February\u2019s sub-four paper, by comparison, had drawn global attention.",
      "\u201cEven if we don\u2019t go below four, how exciting is it just to have this attempt?\u201d Kipp said. \u201cIs it really going to be a failure if she runs, you know, 4:01, 4:02? It\u2019s still going to be a big deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how Eliud Kipchoge\u2019s first sub-two [marathon] attempt was. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it lowered the standard, and it made us realize if we can get closer, we can do it.\u201d"

      "From navigating tough weather in Australia to being questioned by police in Egypt, Ian Andersen has faced many challenges in his journeys biking across continents and documenting them on social media.",
      "But the American creator, known as \u201cridewithian\u201d to his 43,300 followers on TikTok, never had war on his list of possible hurdles \u2014 until last week. Amid his 29-day trek across Iran, Andersen found himself stuck just after Israeli forces began a \u201cpre-emptive\u201d strike on the country.",
      "As Iran and Israel continue to trade attacks, visitors like Andersen have scrambled to find ways to safely exit the Middle East. He was among several people to document how he was able to depart the country, and he shared his journey with followers.",
      "Andersen said that at first, he was determined to continue his Iran trip \u201cas intended.\u201d But then his guide, Reza, told him something that made him change course. \u201cI can no longer protect you,\u201d Reza said, according to Andersen. \u201cIf you\u2019re stopped by police, I should just wave goodbye, because there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d",
      "As of Wednesday, the State Department had advised citizens to \u201cleave Iran now\u201d and to have plans that do \u201cnot rely on U.S. government help.\u201d Other governments have also warned their citizens to leave the region as the conflict unfolds and airspace closes. The United Kingdom has advised against \"all travel to Iran.\" Similarly, Australia has said its citizens should not travel to Israel. Major U.S. carriers like Delta and American have offered rebooking options.",
      "Some Americans in Israel have also been able to leave the region after the state of Florida and a nonprofit organization arranged a flight to bring evacuees home.",
      "Andersen said his departure was possible only because of Reza, whose last name he did not share to protect his safety, and help from the State Department.",
      "\u201cI had a couple weeks there in country of really positive good experiences,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Experiencing Iran as it should be experienced.\u201d",
      "His first vlog from Iran, posted June 2, recorded him crossing into the country from Turkey. Not unlike other influencers whose content focuses on travel, Andersen also posted himself trying different local cuisines \u2014 including a fermented yogurt drink, a Persian omelet and kaleh pacheh, a stew made with goat head \u2014 and showing the hospitality of the Iranian people.",
      "\"They tried to give us for free and said we are their guests, but we had to insist,\" Andersen says in one video, which Reza explains is an example of the \"ta\u2019arof,\" a form of etiquette practiced by Iranians worldwide.",
      "As he biked around the country, he also captured the landscape and talked to viewers about the impact of sanctions, asking in one video, \"What happens when a country is cut off from the global economy for decades?\"",
      "The lighthearted, fun tone of his videos began to shift one week ago while he was in Chalus. Many of his followers began commenting, sharing concerns about his safety.",
      "\"Actually all of us are sad because this is happening,\" Reza says in one video after they heard news of the attack. \"But hope for world without war. ... Everybody needs a peaceful world.\"",
      "The two were headed toward Tehran to try to sort out a visa for Afghanistan, which was the next country on Andersen's itinerary.",
      "\"It's amazing that even after such an event, you know, an emergency, that people are so friendly,\" Andersen says after two people eating near them bring them a meal and insist they share with them.",
      "The information that was available in Iran was initially unclear, and it left Andersen with questions. Iran plunged into a near-total internet blackout this week, limiting Iranians\u2019 ability to access and share information with the outside world.",
      "The situation soon became \u201ctoo dangerous,\" Andersen says in another video, and he and Reza decided not to go to Tehran.",
      "\u201cIt ended up being a good call, \u2019cause there was just more and more attacks as the days went by,\u201d Andersen told NBC News as he reflected on his past week.",
      "\u201cThere was lots of rumors flying around about what borders might be open,\" he added. \"Like, what, like one of the requirements once you get to the border? Like if you\u2019re able to get a visa, if you can just go through. A lifeline came through via an email from the State Department about getting into Azerbaijan.\"",
      "He ultimately was able to exit through Azerbaijan with help from Reza, who drove them to the border. He said he \"probably wouldn\u2019t be here talking\" if it weren't for Reza.",
      "\"I\u2019m out, and truly grateful for all your prayers, messages, and support,\" Andersen wrote in a recent video update. \"It\u2019s an honor to have you following this journey and caring about my wellbeing out here in the Middle East. ... And finally, to my Iranian guide Reza\u2014there\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather have had by my side.\"",
      "Andersen said that since he left the country, his thoughts continue to be with the people of both Iran and Israel and that he is also \u201cthinking about all the people who don\u2019t have the option to leave, like I did.\u201d",
      "U.K.-based influencers Nadia Akhtar and Irfan Aziz, who go by the handle \"fieldofvisions\" on TikTok, where they have 60,000 followers, were also in Iran when the strikes began.",
      "The couple, who were unavailable for an interview, were traveling with their young son, Zakariya. They quickly realized they were among the last to enter the country on an incoming flight and soon had a front-row seat for the attacks from their balcony.",
      "\"Iranian forces were intercepting Israeli drones right above us,\" Aziz says in a video. \"That night, we realized this wasn't normal and it's nothing like what has happened before. We needed to start thinking about an exit plan.\"",
      "The advice they got from officials was simple: \u201cGet out now.\" Like Andersen, they said they leaned on help from their guide, Ali, to help them get out.",
      "Aziz said that at 1:30 a.m. that night, they drove with Ali \"through the night despite getting zero sleep\" to get to the Turkish border.",
      "\"It was when we approached Tabriz, seven hours from Tehran, the reality of the situation kicked in,\" Aziz says in the video, adding that they saw smoke rising in different areas around them.",
      "\"Locals told us five fighter jets had bombed a cement factory at 5 in the morning. Nowhere was truly safe,\" he added.",
      "Akhtar and Aziz described their goodbyes with their guide when they finally reached Turkey\u2019s border as \u201cemotional.\u201d",
      "\"Even though we had just met, he sacrificed his own family's safety, leaving them behind in Tehran to help us,\" Aziz says in part two of his video series about the experience. \"And for this, we will forever be grateful to him. But not everyone has the privilege of leaving like we did. Millions of people just like Ali are at the receiving end of the war that has nothing to do with them.\""

      "Nearly 150 people were jabbed with syringes during a street music festival in France, the country\u2019s interior ministry said, adding that authorities had arrested at least 12 suspects.",
      "Across France, millions of people spilled out into the streets over the weekend to celebrate the annual F\u00eate de la Musique. In Paris, the capital, authorities reported that there were three to four times as many people in public as normal.",
      "The needle attacks involved 145 victims, including 13 in Paris, the French Interior Ministry told NBC News in a statement, adding that at least 12 people had been arrested.",
      "In the northeastern French city of Metz, police arrested two individuals, including a \u201csyringe attacker,\u201d during a festival that broke all attendance records, Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Grosdidier said in a post on Instagram.",
      "\u201cRisks are always present in wild. ... However, we had to deal with syringe attacks,\u201d Grosdidier wrote.",
      "The first syringe attack in Metz was reported at about 9:15 p.m. local time, he said, adding that the victims included 15 young women aged 14 to 20. The suspected syringe attacker had been arrested and handed over to the National Police, he added.",
      "\"I hope that the investigation, particularly through the examination of his cell phone, will lead to the identification of other attackers,\" Grosdidier said.",
      "French officials did not say if these were cases of \u201cneedle spiking,\u201d in which attackers typically inject victims with date-rape drugs such as Rohypnol or GHB, usually in the arm, leg or buttocks, leaving them disoriented and vulnerable to assault.",
      "Warnings about the attacks first appeared on TikTok from social media influencer Abr\u00e8ge Soeur, who said in a post on Saturday that \"Men are planning to attack and sting women at the F\u00eate de la Musique on June 21st.\"",
      "Soeur, who describes herself as a feminist, suggested that women in danger during the festival use \"H&M\" as a code.",
      "\"Approach the person and ask, 'Where\u2019s your top from?' If they answer 'H&M,' it means they need help,\" Soeur said. If \"you are in danger, hail someone over and ask, 'Where\u2019s your top from? H&M, right?'\" she added.",
      "This year's summer music festival season in Paris has brought with it renewed fears of syringe attacks after a wave of reports in 2022. At the time, the French government put out alerts advising people to stay vigilant, go to the police, and take a toxicology test if they suspected they had been drugged by a needle prick.",
      "More than 370 people were arrested on various charges during the festival that year, including nearly 90 in Paris. Among the 14 seriously injured festivalgoers was a 17-year-old who was hospitalized from wounds to the lower abdomen, according to the news agency Agence France-Presse."
