      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Anderson\u2019s ultracontemporary opus signifies a major gamble by Warner Bros. With \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d the studio is making a $130 million-plus bet that audiences would come out for 170-minute-long powerhouse drama from one of cinema\u2019s most celebrated auteurs the way they usually only turn up for a franchise or superhero movie.",
      "Anderson, many critics said, delivered the movie of year. \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor and Sean Penn, has been hailed as a film brimming with many of the political conflicts of today. Oscar prognosticators have pegged it this year\u2019s best-picture front-runner. Aided by DiCaprio\u2019s drawing power, the film added $26.1 million overseas.",
      "But good reviews, star power and a marquee filmmaker are nowadays often insufficient to make a hit. For a movie that cost at least $130 million to make, plus many millions more to market, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will have a long road to reach profitability. For most releases with such a high budget, a $22.4 million start would be a disappointment.",
      "Executives for Warner Bros. declined to be interviewed about the opening.",
      "Yet \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d like movies from earlier movie eras, will hope its time in theaters is more about the long run than opening weekend. Warners is hoping word-of-mouth, awards conversation and a rolling awareness that \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is a major movie event, will keep ticket sales strong in the weeks, or even months, to come.",
      "Some signs suggest that\u2019s possible. Audiences gave \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. That\u2019s far better than CinemaScores for previous Anderson wide releases, including 1997\u2019s \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d (\u201cC\u201d), 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia\u201d (\u201cC-\u201d) and 2002\u2019s \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d (\u201cD+).",
      "\u201cThe long-term playability is going to be key for this,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cAnd given the outpouring of support by critics and audiences, alike, that's where it's going to make back its budget.\u201d",
      "Yet as highly regarded as Anderson is, his films have rarely made a big impact at the box office. His biggest hit was 2007\u2019s \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which collected $76.4 million worldwide.",
      "For Warner Bros., \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d marked its ninth movie this year to open No. 1, more than any other studio. That success \u2014 with $4 billion in global sales \u2014 has included some refreshingly original films that haven\u2019t always made their most obvious way into theaters.",
      "Warners released Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d in April, and it went on to gross $366.7 million worldwide. \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d chose to opt out of the usual fall festival platforms for prestige films, and first screened while most critics were in Venice or Toronto. Yet \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will likely be favorites for many of the same prizes in the coming awards season.",
      "Anderson\u2019s film, loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d stars DiCaprio as a former revolutionary living off the grid with his teenage daughter (Chase Infiniti). Shot in VistaVision, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d played in several large-screen formats, including 70mm, IMAX, 70mm and, on four screens, in VistaVision.",
      "Second place went \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie.\u201d The Universal Pictures release, produced by DreamWorks Animation, grossed $13.5 million in 3,500 theaters. It\u2019s a good start for the G-rated film, based on the long-running series. \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie,\u201d which cost $32 million to make, also earned an \u201cA+\u201d CinemaScore from audiences.",

      "A new poll finds that younger adults are more likely to use subtitles while watching TV or movies than are older adults",
      "NEW YORK -- Taylor Heine, 35, is often multitasking when she watches TV shows or movies at home. \u201cI\u2019ll be playing on the phone, loving on my animals, maybe cleaning, picking up,\u201d she says.",
      "So she watches with the subtitles turned on.",
      "\u201cThat way I can kind of switch back and forth, be able to listen to it or look back at the screen and I know what\u2019s going on, Heine says.\u201d She can also catch up if she misses a piece of dialogue.",

      "\"When he\u2019s cooking or banging around in the kitchen, that way I don\u2019t have to blare the TV,\" she says.",
      "Closed captions or subtitles can be an acquired taste. Some people find them distracting, and even family members in the same household can be in disagreement, resulting in tussles for the remote. But Heine, who lives in Johnson City, Tennessee, is in good company, according to a new survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research: People under age 45 are more likely to use them than older adults.",
      "The poll finds that about 4 in 10 adults under 45 use subtitles at least \u201coften\u201d when watching TV or movies, compared with about 3 in 10 adults older than 45. Those 60 and older are especially likely to say they \u201cnever\u201d use subtitles.",
      "The poll suggests many young adults use subtitles because they are watching in noisy environments, whereas older adults choose them to better hear or understand what is being said.",
      "That makes sense to David Barber, a sound editor and mixer and president of the Motion Picture Sound Editors.",
      "\u201cPart of it is cultural,\u201d Barber says. \u201cWhat the younger kids are doing is, a lot of them will multitask. They\u2019ll listen to music while they\u2019re watching a show. So they\u2019re catching bits and pieces of this, bits and pieces of that. I think they probably are half-listening and half-watching. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon.\u201d",
      "Many people, regardless of age, use closed captions simply to better catch dialogue.",
      "Most subtitle-users, 55%, say they use closed captions because they want to catch every word. About 4 in 10 say they do so because of difficulty understanding accents or because they are watching a foreign movie or show.",
      "Ariaunna Davis, 21, says she typically uses subtitles if she is in an environment where she cannot hear the audio and does not want to blast the volume, or if she cannot understand a character\u2019s accent.",
      "\u201cIf I want to know most of the words that are being said and the audio\u2019s a bit iffy, then that\u2019s the moment I\u2019ll mostly use captions,\u201d she says.",
      "Adrian Alaniz, 31, of Midland, Texas, thinks his hearing was slightly damaged by the concerts he attended when he was younger. With subtitles, he can be sure he is understanding what is going on, particularly if he is eating something crunchy like a bag of chips.",
      "In the animated shows Alaniz watches, the subtitles are particularly helpful for translation. There have been times, he says, when dubbed audio and subtitles do not match. \u201cSometimes the audio doesn\u2019t come across as clearly and the subtitles do help in that matter,\u201d he says.",
      "The poll found that about 3 in 10 U.S. adults use subtitles because they are watching in a noisy environment, while roughly one-quarter say they do so because of poor audio quality.",

He also notes that speakers are often on the back of a flat-screen TV and project toward the wall. \u201cSo you\u2019re not listening on a stellar sound system to start with,\u201d he says.",
      "Another factor is performance-based.",
      "Actors have \u201ca more internal and close\u201d style of emoting than they did decades ago, says sound designer Karol Urban, and sometimes that makes it difficult to discern dialogue.",
      "And there is now simply a lot more sound competing with dialogue, Urban says. \u201cBack in the day there were a lot less sound effects, less music swells,\u201d she notes. \u201cWhen you add more things under dialogue, you\u2019re adding more frequencies and things that can interfere with dialogue.\u201d",
      "Davis, of Tampa, Florida, points to the show \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d as one instance where she often turns on subtitles so she is not constantly adjusting the volume.",
      "\u201cA lot of times the speaking in that show is low and fits the dark environment if it\u2019s in a certain scene,\u201d she says. \u201cThen the next scene will be just music and it's blasting through the walls.\u201d",
      "About one-quarter of subtitle users say they turn on captions because they are watching while multitasking. Fewer say the reason is a hearing impairment, trying to learn a new language or watching with the sound off.",
      "Ask a younger or older adult, though, and you could get a very different justification.",
      "Young adults who have used subtitles are more likely than those 45 and older to say they do this because they are watching in a noisy environment or watching while multitasking. Older subtitle users \u2014 those 45 and older \u2014 are more likely than younger adults to say they use closed captions because they have difficulty understanding accents or because of a hearing impairment.",
      "About 3 in 10 adults 60 and older who use subtitles say they use closed captions because of a hearing impairment, compared with only 7% for younger adults.",
      "Patricia Gill, 67, of Columbus, Tennessee, does not use closed captions. But when her grandson comes over, Gill often notices he has subtitles on his phone when watching movies.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a typical almost-teenager, he just likes watching his phone,\u201d she says.",

      "Two of Case's new songs honor friends, both musicians, who died recently. One is for Dexter Romweber of the Flat Duo Jets, whose songs inspired her to make music before he later became a friend and collaborator. Dallas Good, late singer of The Sadies, who played with Case early in her career, is the inspiration for \u201cMatch-Lit.\u201d",
      "The latter, a detailed description of what happens when a match is lit, illustrates Case's often intriguing pathways to songs; she memorably once wrote from the point of view of a tornado. \u201cI don't do it purposely to try and be weird,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm just a noticer, a chronic noticer.\u201d",
      "Sometimes it's up to the listener to determine what a song means to them, rather than try to figure out what Case specifically meant.",
      "\u201cThere's a bit of, not withholding, but leaving space for people to come into the song and wear it like it's theirs and for them to make associations about their own lives, to make it about themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the songs that meant a lot to me, or did when I was younger. I want the listener to feel invited into it.\u201d",
      "On \u201cRusty Mountain,\u201d Case sings about how writing love songs is mostly \u201can exercise in futility for me.\u201d Slowly it dawns on you that you're listening to a love song. Similarly, \u201cWreck\u201d \u2014 with the memorable line \u201cI'm a meteor shattering around you\u201d \u2014 suggests Case protests a bit too much.",
      "\u201cThere's all different kinds of love on there,\u201d she said. \u201cI think pretty much every song, save maybe one, is a love song \u2014 about music or musicians or specific people here or there. There are love songs about other things, rather than just heterosexual love, which is the thing people write about most of all.",
      "\u201cIt's difficult to avoid cliches when you're writing love songs,\u201d she said, \u201cand the people who are good at it are so good at it that you're like, \u2018why bother?\u2019 I always think about Louie Armstrong singing, \u2018If I Could Be With You,\u2019 and I think, \u2018is there a better love song than that?\u2019 I don't think so. Or his version of \u2018I Can\u2019t Give You Anything But Love.' The bar of people who write love songs is so high that I kind of feel daunted by it.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Paul Thomas Anderson spent about 20 years writing \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d After two decades, it\u2019s never felt more relevant.",
      "The epic action thriller, inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d hits theaters Friday. With a running time of 2 hours and 50 minutes, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d wastes no time immersing audiences in its politically charged world.",
      "The revolution will not be televised, but it will be placed at the front and center of Anderson\u2019s film. The director isn\u2019t there to make his audience comfortable, star Teyana Taylor says, as he zeros in on themes of immigration, racism and systemic corruption showcased at their most absurd.",
      "\u201cI feel like PTA calls out a lot of things that are trying to get swept under the rug,\u201d Taylor told The Associated Press, referring to the director by his nickname. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I respect. This is really waking, shaking and baking some s---. Like, you gotta shake the table.\u201d",
      "Taylor\u2019s character, Perfidia Beverly Hills, is a member of the Weather Underground-inspired French 75 revolutionary group. From the film\u2019s first scene, we see the French 75 take matters into their own hands, liberating undocumented detainees, destroying corrupt political offices and launching their own form of justice, one right after the other. The group is peppered with members portrayed by musicians-turned-actors like Dijon Duenas, Alana Haim, and Shayna McHayle and notable actors like Regina Hall and Wood Harris.",
      "\u201cI mean, this movie is based on some of the revolutionaries and anarchists of the late '60s, the Weathermen that were fighting for civil rights, environmentalism too at the time, capitalism, Vietnam,\u201d star Leonardo DiCaprio told the AP. \u201cBut it\u2019s about the implosion of that too, about the extremes that people go to for their own ideology.\u201d",
      "DiCaprio portrays Bob Ferguson, known in the French 75\u2019s initial scenes as Ghetto Pat, known for his knowledge of explosives and undying devotion to both Perfidia and the revolution. Together, Perfidia and Pat seem unstoppable, until the racist and xenophobic Col. Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn) sets out end the group to fuel his rise to power.",
      "\u201cAnd this is a movie, fast-forward, in today\u2019s day and age, where you see this sort of systematic breakdown that comes from it, if it\u2019s not done with grace and purity and consistently, the whole sort of\u2014 our revolution is dismantled and our past comes back to haunt us,\u201d said DiCaprio. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I love that Paul did. He shows extremity on both sides of the spectrum and how no one seems to be communicating or getting things done in the right way nowadays.\u201d",
      "The film jumps 16 years into the future. Perfidia has disappeared and DiCaprio\u2019s character lives under a new alias in a sanctuary city as a paranoid, stoner dad with his teenage daughter, Willa (newcomer Chase Infiniti). Everything is seemingly mundane until Lockjaw reappears, forcing the father-daughter duo on the run.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of moments where I was like, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna be able to do this, but thankfully I had amazing scene partners and a great support system to kind of assure me that I was here to do my job and I knew exactly that I could do it,\u201d Infiniti said.",
      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is Anderson\u2019s most expensive project to date and shot entirely in VistaVision \u2014 a decades-old format that's been revived in recent years by movies like \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",

      "In the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201dstreaming on Apple TV+ Friday, audiences are presented with a sticky conundrum: What if your soulmate, and your best friend, were different people?",
      "Reactions might differ about the choices Simon (Goldstein) and Laura (Imogen Poots) make in the film, which is a kind of rom-com-dram, if you will. But one thing Goldstein has noticed is that a lot of people who see it think that it\u2019s about them.",
      "\u201cI think everyone has this friendship,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in their life that is not their partner that they have a connection that feels more than friends, but what is that? What is love? And does it take away from the other? We just wanted to explore all of that over time.\u201d",
      "The idea came out of a getting to know you conversation with William Bridges, an Emmy winner for \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d whose episodes include \u201cUSS Callister.\" He co-wrote the film with Goldstein, and directed. At the time of the chat, Goldstein was single. Bridges was not. And Goldstein asked him if the woman he was seeing was \u201cthe one.\u201d It got them thinking about the idea of a soulmate test, something that could just take all the guesswork, all the bad dates, all the lost time, out of the equation.",
      "\u201cAll of You\u201d begins with a moment of truth as Simon accompanies Laura, his best friend from university, on her way to take the test. He even pays for it, and soon enough she\u2019s off making plans with a husband to be.",
      "Though the film has a bit of a science fiction element to it, it\u2019s decidedly less dystopian than a \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Some, like Laura, take the test. Some, like Simon, try to do it the old-fashioned way. But many are left wondering if they made the right choice. The film is told linearly, but skips over months and sometimes years in the saga of Laura and Simon.",

      "\u201cOne thing we didn\u2019t want to do that I think romantic comedies do a lot is they make the other guy boring or a (expletive)-head. So you\u2019re going, \u2018Oh, obviously not him,\u2019\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cYou have to kind of stack the odds against all of them because that is more real and it\u2019s much more challenging, I think, for an audience because I think you are going \u2018I want this thing to happen and I also don\u2019t want this thing to happen.\u2019\u201d",

An even less intentional reference was \u201cAtonement.\u201d Unbeknownst to the filmmakers, they set a pivotal scene between Laura and Simon in the same cottage on the English Channel in East Sussex that Joe Wright used for his classic tearjerker.",
      "While movie fans might bemoan the lack of the Nora Ephron-style romantic comedies of the 1990s on our screens, modern movies are grappling with the state of relationships in serious, satirical and genre-skewing ways, with films like \u201cMaterialists,\u201d\u201cSplitsville,\u201d \u201cAll of You\u201d and more. The distinction, Bridges said, is perhaps audiences today are craving stories not about aspirational, unattainable romance, but about love \u2014 however complicated and messy it might be.",
      "\u201cWe have seen the movie where somebody runs to the train station at the end and confesses undying love and the movie ends and the idea is they live happily ever after. But I\u2019m not quite sure that that\u2019s the experience of love that a lot of people have,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking for love stories rather than romance stories.\u201d",

      "The attorneys for the family of Kevin Rodriguez Zavala, 32, said the fact that he had a spinal disability from birth and used a wheelchair played no role in his death, and he had no medical issues before getting on the Stardust Racers ride at Epic Universe. At a news conference in Orlando, the lawyers also took issue with a top Universal executive last weekend saying in a note to employees that \u201cinternal findings\u201d showed the ride worked as it should have.",

      "Zavala's family described him as a theme park enthusiast and a gamer with friends worldwide from gaming. He treasured his independence and drove and cooked for himself. He also worked as an employment counselor for people with disabilities, helping them land jobs and then checking on them once they started working. His parents said they never treated him any differently than his sister and brother because of his disability.",

      "NEW YORK -- When Lear deBessonet, the incoming artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, was thinking about what should be her first show as its new leader, she landed on something sweeping, very American \u2014 and some unfinished business.",
      "She had just directed an off-Broadway concert version of \u201cRagtime\u201d \u2014 a big, soaring musical celebrating early 20th-century America \u2014 that had wowed critics despite being a bare-boned production with some actors reading from their scripts. Might it fit the bill if she filled it out?",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re hoping is to make work that\u2019s going to be meaningful in people\u2019s lives, and I really felt that it was. And that it was in a way that wasn\u2019t finished,\u201d the Tony Award-nominated director says. \u201cIt really warranted the full flourishing of the idea.\u201d",
      "She gets her wish this fall as 33 actors buoyed by an 28-piece orchestra announce her arrival with a full-throated Broadway revival of the stage version of E.L. Doctorow\u2019s bestselling novel. Previews begin Friday; opening night is Oct. 16.",
      "\u201cRagtime'' is the story of three distinct groups of characters navigating their way through the turbulent racial and economic times of 1906 in New York City \u2014 a Jewish immigrant with his young daughter, a well-to-do white family and a Black piano player.",
      "\u201cBecause \u2018Ragtime\u2019 has, in fact, so many stories with multiple protagonists, there is an opportunity for people to connect with it in many different ways that reflect their own history, their own family\u2019s history, their own experience,\u201d she says.",
      "Tony Award-nominee Joshua Henry leads the cast and views it as the perfect musical for this moment. \u201cHow we see each other, how we hear each other is right now at the forefront,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI think \u2018Ragtime\u2019 puts the spotlight on how we have been successful and not successful doing that in the past, and I feel that\u2019s going to help us move forward.\u201d",
      "The revival is part of a slate of shows that deBessonet is crafting for the multi-Tony Award-winning, three-theater complex on the Lincoln Center campus, one that has built a reputation for new plays and sumptuous revivals of great musicals.",
      "\u201cThe work we make here I want it to be something that anyone of any background \u2014 whether they are visiting New York City or were born here \u2014 could come in and feel restored to humanity, feel connected to other people,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of why I\u2019m such a passionate advocate for the theater as an art form is, I really believe, it\u2019s a place where we can gather across difference.\u201d",

      "A Seattle-area nonprofit group called Community Loaves donates home-baked bread and cookies to food banks in four states",
      "On a recent Saturday near Seattle, Cheryl Ewaldsen pulled three golden loaves of wheat bread out of her kitchen oven.",
      "The fragrant, oat-topped bread was destined not for her table, but for a local food bank, to be distributed to families increasingly struggling with hunger and the high cost of groceries.",
      "\u201cI just get really excited about it knowing that it\u2019s going to someone and they\u2019re going to make, like, 10 sandwiches,\u201d said Ewaldsen, 75, a retired university human resources director.",
      "Ewaldsen is a volunteer with Community Loaves, a Seattle-area nonprofit that started pairing home bakers with food pantries during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and hasn\u2019t stopped.",
      "Since 2020, the organization headed by Katherine Kehrli, the former dean of a culinary school, has donated more than 200,000 loaves of fresh bread and some 220,000 energy cookies to food banks. They come from a network of nearly 900 bakers in four states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho \u2014 and represent one of the largest such efforts in the country.",
      "Now, amid cuts in federal funding for food aid to the poor and rising grocery prices, demand for the group's donations of nutritious baked goods is greater than ever, Kehrli said.",
      "\u201cMost of our food banks do not get any kind of whole-grain sandwich bread donation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we ask what we could do better, they just say, \u2018Bring us more.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ewaldsen\u2019s bread goes to the nearby Edmonds Food Bank, where the client list has swelled from 350 households to nearly 1,000 in the past three years, according to program manager Lester Almanza.",
      "Nationwide, more than 50 million people a year receive charitable food assistance, according to Feeding America, a hunger relief organization.",
      "Anti-hunger experts say they expect the need to rise as recent federal legislation sharply cutting food aid to the poor takes effect. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.",
      "Gauging the impact, however, could soon be more difficult after the U.S. Agriculture Department recently said it would halt an annual report on hunger in America, saying it was redundant, costly and politicized \u201csubjective liberal fodder.\u201d After 30 years, the 2024 report, to be released on Oct. 22, will be the last, the agency said.",
      "\u201cEnding data collection will not end hunger, it will only make it a hidden crisis that is easier to ignore and more difficult to address,\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said in a statement.",
      "Almanza said federal funding for his food bank has dropped at least 10% this year, meaning that every donation helps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that a lot of people rely on,\u201d he said.",
      "That includes people like Chris Redfearn, 42, and his wife, Melanie Rodriguez-Redfearn, 43, who turned to a food bank in Everett, Washington, last spring after moving to the area to find work. They had to stretch their savings until she began a new position this month teaching history at a local college. Chris Redfearn, who has worked for decades in business, is still looking.",
      "\u201cThe food pantry assists with anywhere from $40 to $80 worth of savings weekly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to keep ourselves afloat.\u201d",

      "Finding homemade bread from Community Loaves at a food pantry was a surprise, the couple said. Often, surplus bread sent by grocery stores includes highly processed white breads or sweets donated near their expiration or sell-by dates.",
      "The breads come in three varieties \u2014 honey oat, whole wheat and sunflower rye \u2014 all made with whole grains and minimally processed ingredients.",
      "\u201cThey make it really wholesome and fibrous,\u201d Chris Redfearn said. \u201cIt mimics most of the health-conscious breads that are out there.\u201d",
      "The notion of donating home-baked bread came to Kehrli, 61, during the pandemic, when she was displaced from her job at the busy Seattle Culinary Academy.",
      "\u201cI love to bake and just an idea sparked: Would it be possible for us to help from our home and get important valuable nutrition to our food banks?\u201d she recalled.",
      "Many food pantries don\u2019t accept or distribute donations of homemade baked goods. Feeding America warns individual bakers against the practice, saying \u201csince food banks can\u2019t confirm how your baked goods were made or their ingredients, they can\u2019t be donated.\"",
      "But health department rules vary by state, Kehrli learned. In Washington and the other three states where Community Loaves now operates, bread is one of the few foods allowed to be donated from a home kitchen through a program like theirs.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to donate custard pies. We wouldn\u2019t be able to donate lasagna,\u201d Kehrli said. \u201cBut bread is deemed safe. Anything that is fully baked and does not require refrigeration.\u201d",
      "Still, Community Loaves bakers must follow approved recipes for the bread and two types of energy cookies. They obtain flour from common sources, and bake and deliver on a shared schedule twice a month.",
      "The bakers buy their own supplies, donating the cost of the ingredients as well as their time. Most make a few loaves per baking session before delivering them to local \u201chubs,\u201d where other volunteers collect the bread and transport it to the food banks.",
      "Bakers range from former professionals to beginners. A robust website with recipes and how-to videos backstops every step, Kehrli said.",
      "Baking the bread is satisfying on several levels, said Ewaldsen, who has donated nearly 800 loaves in less than two years. Part of it is addressing the physical need for food, but part is also addressing the spiritual hunger for connection with neighbors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the opportunity for me to bake something and to share something with others in the community, where they don\u2019t necessarily need to know who I am, but they know that there\u2019s a community that loves and cares for them,\u201d she said.",
      "While such sentiments are sincere and admirable, anti-hunger experts stress that individual donations can't take the place of adequately funded government services for struggling Americans.",
      "\u201cIt's beautiful that our communities act this way,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino of the Food Research & Action Center. \u201cBut it is a loaf of bread. That is going to feed one person \u2014 and there are millions in line.\"",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",

      "The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective.",

      "In March, the Trump administration cut more than $1 billion from two U.S. Department of Agriculture programs \u2014 the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides free food to food banks nationwide, and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provides funds to state, territorial and tribal governments to purchase food from local farmers for distribution to hunger relief organizations.",

      "Complicating matters is the infrastructure through which the U.S. distributes most food to those who need help. In Maine, the nearly 600 hunger relief agencies that get free and low-cost food from Good Shepherd Food Bank rely on volunteers. This includes 250 food pantries as well as soup kitchens, senior centers, shelters, schools and youth programs.",

      "Keith Ritchie was greeting clients \u2014 and keeping a gentle eye out to make sure no one took more than their fair share of limited foods. At 89, he is the pantry\u2019s oldest worker, although Betty Williams, 88, teases him about who\u2019s older.",
      "In more than 17 years of service, Ritchie said, \u201cI\u2019ve only missed twice.\u201d He drives 20 miles (32 kilometers) each way to dole out groceries and fill bags with \u201csurprises\u201d \u2013 donated items like Girl Scout cookies.",

      "Fatal shark bites are vanishingly rare, with less than 50 unprovoked shark bites on humans worldwide in 2024, according to the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History. But increased sightings of large sharks in some parts of the world have swimmers, surfers and divers looking for new ways to stay safe.",

They performed the work by dragging samples of the materials behind boats and allowing white and tiger sharks to bite the samples.",
      "The bites from such large sharks can still cause internal and crushing injuries, but the materials showed effectiveness beyond a standard neoprene wetsuit, the scientists said. The research found that the bite-resistant materials \u201ccan reduce injuries sustained from shark encounters,\u201d said Flinders professor Charlie Huveneers, a member of the Southern Shark Ecology Group at Flinders and a study co-author.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration has extended Georgia's Pathways to Coverage program for 15 months",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's program that provides health insurance to some low-income adults that document work or other activities has been extended for 15 months by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced Thursday that the federal government approved that the Pathways to Coverage program will continue as part of the state-federal Medicaid program through December 2026. The five-year pilot program had been scheduled to expire next week, but Kemp argued Georgia should get more time because the program only started after a court battle with President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, which tried to shut it down.",
      "Georgia's program has been closely watched because Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the country as part of the tax and budget overhaul signed into law by Trump. Starting in 2027, some adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "The Georgia program, which has similar work or activity requirements, has enrolled far fewer people than originally projected, covering 9,175 people as of August. It has spent twice as much on administrative costs than on providing actual health care. The Kemp administration had projected it would cover 25,000 people in its first year and up to 100,000 eventually.",
      "Critics warn the Georgia experience shows that millions will lose coverage under the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to document their work. Republicans have defended the low enrollment, saying Medicaid should be temporary for people who can get insurance through an employer.",
      "Pathways is Kemp's answer to pressure to expand Medicaid to cover all adults who earn less than 138% of federal poverty line wages, as originally envisioned under President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul. Georgia is one of 10 Republican-led states that refused to expand coverage. Instead, Kemp launched Pathways, offering coverage to people who earn up to the poverty line \u2014 $15,650 a year. Georgia\u2019s traditional Medicaid program still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a few other very poor adults.",
      "Under the extension, Georgia will offer health coverage to parents and guardians of children younger than six without any additional work requirement. The state will also let beneficiaries report qualifying work or activity hours only once a yearly, instead of monthly. Some beneficiaries had said the monthly reporting process was glitchy and hard to use. Insurance will also start on the first day of the month that an application is received, meaning hospitals and doctors will have an incentive to help uninsured patients apply in hopes of getting paid for care already delivered. Right now, coverage doesn't start until after someone is approved.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin will stop scheduling patients for abortions starting next week as it works to find a way to provide the service in the face of Medicaid funding cuts in President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, the nonprofit said Thursday.",
      "Abortion funding across the U.S. has been under siege, particularly Planned Parenthood affiliates, which are the biggest provider.",
      "The organization warned earlier this year that about half its clinics that provide abortion could be closed as a result of a ban on Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood for services other than abortion.",
      "The measure was part of the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. Initially, a judge said reimbursements must continue, but a federal appeals court this month said the government could halt the payments while a court challenge to the provision moves ahead.",
      "Planned Parenthood services include cancer screenings and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment. Federal Medicaid money was already not paying for abortion, but affiliates relied on Medicaid to stay afloat.",
      "The remaining Planned Parenthood clinics in Louisiana \u2013 where abortion is banned \u2013 are scheduled to shut down at the end of this month.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said in a statement that it is trying to see as many patients as possible between now and Tuesday. The federal law takes effect Wednesday. It is not scheduling patients beyond that date and the organization believes the move will allow it to continue seeing other Medicaid patients. The organization said it was working with providers across the state to make sure patients are referred quickly and receive timely care.",

      "\u201cPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin will continue to provide the full spectrum of reproductive health care, including abortion, as soon and as we are able to,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said in the statement. \u201cIn the meantime, we are pursuing every available option through the courts, through operations, and civic engagement.\u201d",
      "The abortion landscape has been shifting frequently since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2022 that allowed states to ban abortion. Currently, 12 states do not allow it at any stage of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four more ban it after about six weeks\u2019 gestation.",
      "The bans have resulted in more women traveling for abortion and an increased reliance on abortion pills.

      "UNITED NATIONS -- Every year, tons of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and other drugs flow around the world, an underground river that crisscrosses borders and continents and spills over into violence, addiction and suffering. Yet when nations' leaders give the U.N. their annual take on big issues, drugs don't usually get much of the spotlight.",
      "But this was no usual year.",
      "First, U.S. President Donald Trump touted his aggressive approach to drug enforcement, including decisions to designate some Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and to carry out deadly military strikes on speedboats that he says said were carrying drugs in the southern Caribbean.",
      "\u201cTo every terrorist thug smuggling poisonous drugs into the United States of America: Please be warned that we will blow you out of existence,\u201d he boasted at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.",

      "The U.S. \u201canti-drug policy is not aimed at the public health of a society, but rather to prop up a policy of domination,\u201d Colombia's Gustavo Petro bristled, accusing Washington of ignoring domestic drug dealing and production while demonizing his own country. The U.S. recently listed Colombia, for the first time in decades, as a nation falling short of its international drug control obligations.",
      "The barbs laid bare, on global diplomacy's biggest stage, the world's wide and pointed differences over how to deal with drugs.",
      "\u201cThe international system is extremely divided on drug policy,\u201d said Vanda Felbab-Brown, who has followed the topic as a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution think tank. \u201cThis is not new, but it\u2019s really just very intense at this UNGA.\u201d",
      "While the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, climate change and other crises got much of the focus in the U.N.'s marathon week of speeches and meetings, the topic of drugs turned up from Trump's and Petro's tough talk to side events on such themes as gender-inclusive drug policy and international cooperation to fight organized crime.",
      "Some 316 million people worldwide used marijuana, opioids and/or other drugs in 2023, a 28% rise in a decade, according to the most recent statistics available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. The figures don\u2019t count alcohol or tobacco use.",
      "The specifics vary by region, with cocaine use growing in Europe, methamphetamine on the rise in Southeast Asia, and synthetic opioids making new inroads in West and Central Africa and continuing to trouble North America, though opioid-related deaths have been falling.",
      "The U.N. drug office says trafficking is increasingly dominated by organized crime groups with tentacles and partnerships around the world, and nations need to think just as broadly about trying to tackle the syndicates.",
      "\u201cGovernments are increasingly seeing organized crime and drug trafficking as threats to national and regional security and stability, and some are coming around to the fact that they need to join up diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement and central-bank efforts to push back,\u201d agency chief of staff Jeremy Douglas said by email.",
      "Although organized crime hasn't featured very prominently in top-level discussions at the General Assembly to date, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re at a point where this needs to, and hopefully will, change.\u201d",
      "Nations pair up in various joint counternarcotics operations and working groups and sometimes form regional coalitions, but some experts and leaders see a need to go global.",
      "Countries need to \u201cpool resources in a fight that must be a common cause among all nations,\u201d Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino told the assembly. He said his nation had seized a \u201chistoric and alarming\u201d total of 150 tons of cocaine and other drugs this year alone.",

      "Government scientists say infection rates from drug-resistant \u201cnightmare bacteria\u201d have been increasing dramatically",
      "NEW YORK -- Infection rates from drug-resistant \u201cnightmare bacteria\u201d rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.",
      "Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in an article published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said.",
      "Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.",
      "\u201cThe rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,\u201d said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.",
      "It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said.",
      "That may play out in doctors\u2019 offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat \u2014 like urinary tract infections \u2014 could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report\u2019s authors.",
      "Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise \u2014 unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn\u2019t kill the germs made them stronger.",
      "In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to \u201c nightmare bacteria \u201d resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.",
      "Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.",
      "They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.",
      "The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 \u2014 an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 \u2014 an increase of 460%, the authors said.",

      "Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren\u2019t able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.",
      "The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections \u201cis definitely underestimated,\u201d Burnham said.",

      "North Carolina Republican legislators have introduced criminal justice measures to toughen bail rules and evaluate offenders for mental health issues",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republican legislators are poised this week to approve criminal justice measures designed to toughen bail rules, restrict magistrates' powers and evaluate offenders' mental health after the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte commuter train. The bill also could help get the death penalty carried out again in the ninth-largest U.S. state.",
      "Senate and House Republicans unveiled legislation that their leaders previously signaled would surface when the General Assembly reconvened on Monday after nearly two months away from Raleigh.",
      "The Aug. 22 death of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska \u2014 her attack caught on camera \u2014 and subsequent charges against a suspect who had previously been arrested more than a dozen times caused public outrage. An array of Republicans, President Donald Trump among them, have attempted to blame Zarutska's death on Charlotte-area leaders and Democratic state officials for what they call soft-on-crime policies.",
      "The Senate approved the legislation 28-8 late Monday, with many Democrats absent from the otherwise party-line vote. The bill now goes to the House, where a vote is likely Tuesday.",
      "Any final measure would then go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein\u2019s desk. Stein, the former attorney general, has suggested pretrial release changes and greater emphasis on mental health are needed in light of Zarutska's death.",
      "But the measure took a different direction \u2014 away from bipartisan support \u2014 when Senate Republicans approved an amendment that could in the future open the door to other forms of capital punishment beyond lethal injection, which is currently the state\u2019s sole method. North Carolina last carried out an execution in 2006.",
      "The stabbing suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., could received a death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder in state court or a federal count filed against him.",
      "Brown, whose criminal record included serving more than five years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery using a deadly weapon, had been charged in January in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, with misusing the 911 system, a misdemeanor, according to court records.",
      "But a magistrate \u2014 a nonelected local court official who often determines if a defendant can be released while awaiting trial \u2014 released him on a written promise to return for court. And it took more than six months for a court to order a mental evaluation for him. Brown\u2019s mother told Charlotte-area television that she had sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment this year after he became violent at home.",
      "GOP Sen. Ralph Hise said the legislation has nothing to do with winning political points, but rather is a response to the failure of the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cWe need a criminal justice system that protects society from individuals. I believe these are many great steps in this bill,\u201d Hise said.",
      "The measure, named \u201cIryna\u2019s Law,\u201d would prohibit cashless bail for certain crimes and eliminate some of the discretion that magistrates and judges have for pretrial release decisions.",
      "For example, first-time defendants accused of a violent offense could only be released on a secured cash bond or receive house arrest with electronic monitoring. Such house arrest and monitoring would be the only option for some repeat defendants.",
      "The bill also attempts to ensure that more suspects are subject to psychological examinations before their potential release. Defendants accused of a violent crime and committed involuntarily in recent years to a mental health facility would be subject to a psychological evaluation.",

      "NATO is ramping up aerial surveillance in the Baltic Sea",
      "BRUSSELS -- NATO is stepping up aerial surveillance in the Baltic Sea, while France, Germany and Sweden are bolstering Denmark\u2019s air defenses ahead of two summits in Copenhagen this week over a series of troubling drone incidents near the country\u2019s airports and military bases.",
      "The number of serious airspace violations in Europe has spiked this month, including by Russian warplanes. But not all NATO allies agree on how to respond. Poland is ready to use lethal force. Others say that must only be a last resort.",
      "Regardless of who is to blame in Denmark, European leaders believe that Russia is testing NATO. Military planners in Moscow can observe how Western forces react, and countering intrusions by relatively cheap drones is a financial burden on the allies.",
      "In the wake of the drone incident in Poland, NATO launched operation Eastern Sentry, with Britain among the allies to send more air defense equipment.",
      "However, these deployments might also deprive Ukraine of the air defense systems it badly needs from its allies. NATO must tread a tightrope in its response.",
      "Poland's message is blunt. It intends to shoot down intruders over its territory.",
      "\u201cIf another missile or aircraft enters our space without permission, deliberately or by mistake, and gets shot down and the wreckage falls on NATO territory, please don\u2019t come here to whine about it,\u201d Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski told Russia's U.N. delegation last week. \u201cYou have been warned.\u201d",
      "Poland activated its air defenses over the weekend during a major Russian attack on Ukraine.",
      "Defense is a national prerogative, even within the world\u2019s biggest military alliance. Poland or Finland, say, might use force to defend their territory. U.S. President Donald Trump has agreed that European countries should be able to shoot intruders down.",
      "The responsibility for that act would lie with the nation concerned. NATO, though, is likely to be more cautious in any joint operation using aircraft and equipment drawn from across the 32-country alliance.",
      "\u201cWe have to act decisively and quickly,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said last week, but he underlined that it\u2019s important to \u201calways assess the threat levels\u201d to see whether force is necessary.",
      "NATO\u2019s supreme commander in Europe, U.S. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, manages airspace violations.",
      "NATO\u2019s rules of engagement are classified, but Grynkewich knows what arms and ammunition he has and what restrictions allies might place on their use. More than 30 air bases have aircraft on standby.",
      "His choice would be based on intelligence about the threat posed. It would involve understanding the aircraft\u2019s intent and weaponry, and the risk it \u2014 or a shootdown \u2014 might represent to NATO forces, civilians and infrastructure.",
      "The response should also be proportionate. Spending millions of dollars to deter relatively cheap drones is not sustainable. Sometimes it\u2019s best just to escort aircraft away, as NATO did when three Russian jets flew into Estonian airspace.",
      "\u201cEach airspace incursion puts NATO in a bind,\u201d Rafael Loss from the European Council on Foreign Relations said in a security analysis.",

      "\u201cOpening fire is really, really, really, really the last resort,\" he said.",
      "An overreaction could incur even greater costs. Russia\u2019s ambassador to France, Alexei Meshkov, has already warned that downing a Russian aircraft would trigger a war, and NATO does not want to be dragged into conflict with a nuclear armed adversary.",
      "Already in 2015, Russia and NATO ally Turkey came to the brink of open conflict after a Turkish F-16 shot down a Russian bomber near the Syrian border, killing its pilot. Russia retaliated with sanctions.",
      "In 1983, a Korean Airlines flight was shot down with an air-to-air missile after veering into Soviet airspace, killing all 269 people on board. It caused a major spike in tensions between the Soviet Union and the West.",

      "Right now, though, U.S. leadership appears reticent. Coincidentally or not, the serious airspace violations have happened since Trump\u2019s summit with President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August, when the U.S. leader dropped his demand for a ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "In response to the drone incident in Poland, Trump said that it \u201ccould have been a mistake.\u201d Last week he said the U.S. would \u201ccontinue to supply weapons to NATO for NATO to do what they want with them,\u201d almost as if America were not a member.",
      "And so far, the United States has not sent military equipment to help counter the airspace violations.",
      "\u201cThrough these successive incursions, Putin has shown he is undeterred. After all, by flaunting mischief at low cost, Putin aims to leave Europeans \u2014 lacking resolute American backing \u2014 with only bad options,\u201d Loss said.",

      "CSX railroad replaced its CEO less than two months after an investment fund urged it to either find another railroad to merge with to better compete with the proposed transcontinental Union Pacific railroad or fire outgoing CEO Joe Hinrichs",
      "CSX railroad announced Monday that it had replaced its CEO less than two months after an investment fund urged it to either find another railroad to merge with to better compete with the proposed transcontinental Union Pacific railroad or fire outgoing CEO Joe Hinrichs.",
      "The outgoing CEO, who came to the railroad in 2022 after a long career with Ford, focused on repairing CSX's relationship with its workers and labor unions and unifying the team after a bitter contract fight. But Ancora Holdings, which helped spur major changes at Norfolk Southern, said CSX's operating performance deteriorated significantly under Hinrichs' leadership. Hinrichs resigned to clear the way for Steve Angel to become CEO effective Sunday.",
      "Angel, 70, also comes from outside the rail industry although earlier in his career he oversaw GE's locomotive building unit, so he does have that experience. CSX said he has 45 years experience leading large public companies, including most recently as CEO of Linde and Praxair that provide industrial gasses to other companies.",
      "\u201cWe are excited to welcome Steve as our new CEO. He is a visionary in creating long-term value and an expert in guiding companies through significant transformation,\" the railroad's board Chairman John Zillmer said.",
      "CSX has been under pressure from Ancora and other investors since Union Pacific announced its $85 billion deal to acquire Norfolk Southern, which is CSX's rival in the eastern United States. But both BNSF and CPKC railroads said they aren't interested in a merger right now.",
      "Ancora said CSX has delivered disappointing shareholder returns and poor financial performance during Hinrichs' tenure. But over the past year, CSX was working on two major construction projects \u2014 repairs from Hurricane Helene and a major tunnel renovation in Baltimore \u2014 that disrupted the railroad. Both those projects were just completed this month, so CSX's performance was expected to improve in the fourth quarter.",

      "WASHINGTON -- An experimental medication made from marijuana successfully reduced back pain in a new study, offering further support for the drug\u2019s potential in treating one of the most common forms of chronic pain.",
      "The 800-patient study by a German drugmaker is the latest evidence of the therapeutic properties of cannabis, which remains illegal under U.S. federal law even as most states have made it available for medical or recreational use.",
      "Health officials in Canada and Europe have previously approved a pharmaceutical-grade form of cannabis for several types of pain, including nerve pain due to multiple sclerosis. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has approved a drug containing CBD \u2014 one of the many non-intoxicating chemicals found in cannabis \u2014 to treat rare seizures in children with epilepsy.",
      "Unlike that drug, known as Epidiolex, the new cannabis formula from drugmaker Vertanical contains THC, the active ingredient in marijuana that gets users high. But levels of the chemical are very low, essentially a microdose compared to what\u2019s available in gummies, chocolate bars and other products sold at marijuana dispensaries in the U.S. The company said patients in the trial didn\u2019t show any signs of drug abuse, dependence or withdrawal.",
      "Vertanical is seeking approval for a large group of patients: those suffering from lower-back pain, a chronic condition that affects millions and has few proven treatments.",
      "Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can\u2019t be used for long-term pain because of their side effects, which include stomach ulcers and indigestion. Opioids are no longer recommended, after the overprescribing of painkillers such as OxyContin in the 1990s and 2000s led to the ongoing epidemic of addiction to that class of drug.",
      "Chronic pain is one of the most frequently cited conditions of people enrolled in state-run medical marijuana programs. But there's been little rigorous research on the drug's use in that group.",
      "Lead study author Dr. Matthias Karst said in an email that the new findings show cannabis \"can significantly reduce pain and improve physical function in patients with chronic low-back pain, without the safety concerns commonly associated with opioids.\u201d Karst is a pain specialist at Hannover Medical School and a consultant for Vertanical.",
      "For the new study, patients with back pain were randomly assigned to take Vertanical\u2019s proprietary liquid cannabis extract or a placebo.",

      "Air travel results in a lot of planet-warming emissions, but it's also sometimes necessary",
      "So you're booking your flight, and just when you're about to check out, the airline asks if you'd like to pay a little something to offset your share of the flight's pollution. Or, maybe you're an environmentally minded person, and you've heard you can buy these things called carbon offsets.",
      "Are they worth it? Let's explore.",
      "A roundtrip flight from New York to Los Angeles emits more than 1,300 pounds (about 614 kilograms) of planet-warming carbon dioxide per passenger, according to an emissions calculator from the International Civil Aviation Organization. That's about the amount of pollution you'd save if you swore off meat for 17 months.",
      "Jet engines burn fossil fuels, releasing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. They also release water vapor, which turns into long, thin clouds called contrails that trap heat instead of letting it escape to space \u2014 additional warming that isn't typically included in a flight's emissions, said Diane Vitry, aviation director at a clean energy advocacy organization called the European Federation for Transport and Environment.",
      "Reducing emissions from air travel is difficult. Batteries weigh too much and provide too little power for long flights. Sustainable aviation fuel \u2014 biofuels made from things like corn, oil seeds and algae that can be mixed with jet fuel \u2014 is currently more expensive than traditional fuel and lacking sufficient supply to be in wide use.",
      "\u201cAviation is the problem child,\u201d Vitry said. \u201cAviation and shipping are not decarbonizing, and definitely not fast enough.\u201d",
      "That's where carbon offsets come in.",
      "A carbon offset is a certificate or a permit to emit planet-warming gases. It's connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions \u2014 for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.",
      "The idea is that the program or action offsets your pollutive action. You drive a car that pollutes a certain amount, you buy a carbon offset that leads to the planting of a tree that sequesters the same amount, and bam: the pollutive action (driving) is offset (tree planting).",
      "They've gotten popular enough that there's an entire marketplace that connects people and companies wanting to reduce their impacts with other companies that promise to do so.",
      "Vitry doesn't think so. She calls them a fake climate solution.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it is not what is going to solve aviation\u2019s climate problem,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t clear your climate conscience with an offset.\u201d",
      "Sure, you can plant a tree, but Vitry said that doesn\u2019t stop your flight's emissions from entering the atmosphere. The tree may eventually absorb an equivalent amount of emissions. Or it may die. Or it may be sold as an offset multiple times by an unscrupulous company, meaning the tree can't possible absorb all the emissions it's supposed to.",
      "Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, has studied carbon offsets for more than 20 years. She said some offset schemes are overcounted by 10 to 13 times their actual value.",

      "She said that\u2019s partly because the voluntary offset market is largely unregulated, and it\u2019s really difficult to measure offsets. The other problem is everyone involved benefits from over-exaggerating the benefits of offsets. \u201cThe buyer of the credit wants the cheap credits, the seller of the credits wants to get more credits for the same activity and the third party verifier is hired by the project developer, so has a conflict of interest to be lenient,\u201d Haya said.",
      "Jodi Manning, chief executive of the carbon offset nonprofit Cool Effect, said consumers should beware of offset programs that don't say clearly which project will benefit from your purchase or how much of your money is going to a project. But she said \u201chigh-quality\u201d carbon credits can play an important role where emissions are unavoidable.",
      "Manning said offsets have to be permanent, transparent, and unable to exist without the offset funding.",

      "Several airlines that offer offsets did not respond to requests from AP to talk about their use. One that did, Southwest Airlines, said in a statement that it does not plan to rely on carbon offsets to help it reach a goal of net zero emissions by 2050.",

      "MILAN -- The last Giorgio Armani collection signed by the late designer himself and marking the 50th anniversary of his signature line was shown Sunday night in a solemn runway show that gathered Hollywood stars and Italian friends in tribute.",
      "Richard Gere, Lauren Hutton, Glenn Close and Spike Lee attended the black-tie gala in the courtyard of the Brera Art Gallery where an exhibition features 129 Armani creations in dialogue with Italian masterpieces.",
      "They include one of the soft-shouldered suits that Gere wore in \u201cAmerican Gigolo,\u2019\u2019 looks that helped catapult Armani to global fashion stardom. Gere said he had no idea the Armani suits he wore in the 1980 movie would make fashion history, but he said they helped him decide how to approach the role.",
      "\u201cI was trying the suits on, and I hadn\u2019t decided how I was going to play this character at all,\u2019\u2019 Gere told The Associated Press from the front row. \u201cAnd I had to do it very quickly. I had a couple of weeks to figure it out. I started trying the clothes on, and the clothes actually started telling me who this guy was.\u2019\u2019",
      "Hutton, Gere's \u201cAmerican Gigolo\" co-star, reminisced about a light blue suit that Gere wasn't sure about. She called Armani a \u201ctreasure\u201d who contributed greatly to Italy's economy, and remembered attending a Giorgio Armani fashion show shortly after Gigolo came out.",
      "Armani \u201cgave me a pair of diamond earrings. And they are still the only pair of diamond earrings I have ever had,\u2019\u2019 Hutton said.",
      "Hollywood stars and friends alike honored Armani for his key role in helping putting Milan at the center of global fashion.",

      "The Associated Press sat down with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon at the company's sprawling headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, to talk about AI and the American workforce. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "MCMILLON: I would say pretty much a steady state. Turnover numbers are coming down. I'm remembering what happened during the pandemic and relative to that experience, things feel much more stable now. I think the pace of change in the employment market is just smaller and easier to manage.",
      "MCMILLON: We continue to invest in wages. So I think that\u2019s helping some, and that process will continue. As it relates to AI and the future of employment, I think for the most part, our folks are enthusiastic about it because they\u2019ve seen new tools that they\u2019re receiving that are making their jobs better. That's helping them take fewer steps.",
      "And our sales are growing so much. I think people are optimistic about the future of what their life can look like.",

      "As I look across our company, we have everything from store associates to supply chain associates. Of the 2.1 million people (globally), something less than 75,000 of them are home office jobs. All the other ones are working in a store, a club, a distribution center. And I think those jobs change more gradually. We are still going to want to serve customers and members with people. The change as it relates to the home office jobs probably happens faster.",
      "MCMILLON: I don\u2019t know there\u2019ll be a moment where we all have clarity. I think the way for all of us to approach it, especially here at Walmart, is just in a very transparent, honest, human, straightforward way, talking to people real time about what we\u2019re learning and what we're doing and why we\u2019re doing it.

I hope what happens as we lead through this is that there will be pluses and minuses, but the net ends up being even more people because we have more ideas of how to grow.",
      "MCMILLON: The first thing that comes to mind is store managers. Being a store manager is such a great job and such a challenging job. And it\u2019s a job that pays well, and it pays well for a reason. You\u2019re interacting with the community with large numbers of people. You have a large number of associates. You have big sales numbers to deliver. And those skills that the store manager has are both human and technical. I think the skills that we have as human beings are valuable. They always have been, and that\u2019ll be even more true in the future.",

I think most Americans probably don\u2019t know what a tech makes that helps take care of our stores and clubs and that we can help them learn how to be a tech. The same thing\u2019s true for our drivers. So we have a need to get the word out so that people know there are some great jobs.",

      "CHISINAU, Moldova -- Moldova\u2019s pro-Western ruling party has taken a decisive lead in a critical parliamentary election that was overshadowed by Russian interference claims. The race was widely viewed as a geopolitical choice between a path to the European Union or a drift back into Moscow\u2019s fold.",
      "The tense ballot pitted the governing pro-Western Party of Action and Solidarity, which has held a strong parliamentary majority since 2021, against several Russia-friendly opponents but no viable pro-European partners. But the party now looks on track to secure a majority of legislative seats.",
      "With about 95% of polling station reports counted, official electoral data showed the pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity leading with 48% of the vote, while the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc has 25.6%. The Russia-friendly Alternativa Bloc stood at 8.3% and the populist Our Party \u2014 which wants \u201cbalanced foreign policy\u201d between East and West \u2014 has 6.3%. The right-wing Democracy at Home party has 5.7%.",
      "The election day was marked by a string of incidents, ranging from bomb threats at multiple polling stations abroad to cyberattacks on electoral and government infrastructure, voters photographing their ballots and some being illegally transported to polling stations. Police also detained three people suspected of plotting to cause unrest after the vote.",
      "The pivotal vote will elect a new 101-seat parliament, after which Moldova\u2019s president nominates a prime minister, generally from the leading party or bloc, which can then try to form a new government. A proposed government needs parliamentary approval.",
      "When polls closed locally at 9 p.m. on Sunday, the Central Electoral Commission reported that more than 1.59 million, or about 51.9% of eligible voters had cast ballots. Some 276,000 Moldovans have voted in polling stations set up abroad, which will remain open until 7 p.m. in their respective countries.",
      "Moldova\u2019s large diaspora will likely play a decisive role in the final outcome. In last year\u2019s presidential runoff \u2014 which was also viewed as a choice between East and West \u2014 a record number of 327,000 voters cast ballots abroad, more than 82% of whom favored Moldova\u2019s pro-Western President Maia Sandu.",
      "Sunday\u2019s high-stakes ballot was to some extent a litmus test for the Moldovan authorities in countering what they have long alleged is a massive \u201chybrid war\u201d conducted by Russia, which they accused of spending \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of euros to try to seize power in Moldova and ultimately derail the country\u2019s EU path.",
      "Igor Grosu, the leader of Party of Action and Solidarity, said after polls closed that \u201cRussia\u2019s attempts to hijack the electoral process have been huge\u201d and that state institutions made efforts to ensure the security and integrity of the voting.",

      "Moldova is landlocked between Ukraine and EU member Romania. The country of about 2.5 million people has spent recent years on a westward path and gained candidate status to the EU in 2022, shortly after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Tensions between Russia and Moldova, a Soviet republic until 1991, skyrocketed.",
      "After casting her ballot on Sunday, Sandu reiterated long-held claims that Russia \u201cmassively interfered\u201d in the election, saying she voted \u201cto keep the peace\u201d and insisted her country\u2019s future lies within the EU.",
      "The alleged Russian strategies include a large-scale vote-buying operation, cyberattacks, a plan to incite mass riots around the election and a sprawling disinformation campaign online to diminish support for the pro-European ruling party and sway voters toward Moscow-friendly ones.",
      "Just before the vote, police carried out hundreds of raids, detaining scores of people allegedly trained in Serbia to cause \u201cmass riots\u201d and destabilize the country around the critical election.",

      "Igor Dodon, a former president and a member of the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc, called for a protest in front of the Parliament building on Monday, and later alleged after polls closed that the pro-Western ruling party \u201cis now in panic and is considering various pretexts, excuses and scenarios that go beyond the law and democratic norms.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is planning big tariffs on pharmaceuticals, kitchen counters, bathroom vanities, upholstered furniture and heavy trucks",
      "WASHINGTON -- Naturepedic, a mattress and furniture company based outside Cleveland, has been planning to introduce an upscale upholstered headboard late this year or early in 2026.",
      "But President Donald Trump has thrown those plans into disarray. On Thursday night, the president announced on social media that he was slapping a 30% tax on imported upholstered furniture. Naturepedic ships its headboards in from India and Vietnam.",
      "So what is the company to do?",
      "\u201cDo we continue forth ... and hope for the best?\u2019\u2019 asked Arin Schultz, Naturepedic\u2019s chief growth officer. \u201cOr do we feel like we\u2019re priced out and drop it altogether?\u2019\u2019 And if Naturepedic decides to continue with the rollout, \u201cdo we eat the cost or pass it on\u2019\u2019 to customers?",
      "Across the United States, lots of executives were asking themselves similar questions as they came to work Friday morning.",
      "Upholstered furniture, after all, wasn\u2019t the only import in Trump\u2019s crosshairs Thursday night. In addition, the president posted on his Truth Social platform, he\u2019s plastering import taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2013 of 100% on pharmaceutical drugs, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities and 25% on heavy trucks.",
      "And he\u2019s not waiting around to do it. The tariffs, he said, would take effect Wednesday.",
      "Trump also raised eyebrows by justifying the levy on vanities and sofas as necessary for national security. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how a kitchen cabinet industry is essential to winning the next war,\u2019\u2019 said Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Thursday\u2019s social media barrage was j ust the latest in Trump\u2019s push to upend American trade policy, which for decades pushed for lower trade barriers around the world.",
      "In place of an open market, Trump has built a tariff wall around the U.S. economy, slapping double-digit taxes on imports from almost every country on earth and targeting products (steel, aluminum, autos) with specific taxes of their own.",
      "Trump says the tariffs will protect U.S. industries from foreign competition, encourage companies to bring production to the United States and raise money for the U.S. Treasury.",
      "They certainly have become a moneymaker for the federal government. Since fiscal year 2025 began last Oct. 1, the U.S. Treasury has collected $172 billion in customs duties, up by $96 billion (or 126%) from the same period in fiscal 2024. Still, tariffs account for less than 4% of federal revenue.",
      "Businesses, lawyers and trade analysts are still wondering what to make of Trump\u2019s Thursday night tariffs. \u201cWe\u2019ve only seen the President\u2019s Truth Social posts,\u201d said Dan McCarthy, principal in McCarthy Consulting and a former official with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in the Biden administration. \u201cWe need to see the details.\u2019\u2019",
      "For example, Naturepedic isn\u2019t sure whether the 30% levy on upholstered furniture will be stacked atop a separate and earlier 50% tariff on goods from India.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know so far:",
      "The president has been threatening tariffs of 200% or more on pharmaceuticals. \u201cIt\u2019s to force Big Pharma to move jobs and put new factories into the U.S,\u2019\u2019 said Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School. \u201cSo it\u2019s industrial policy.\u201d",
      "In recent decades, drugmakers have moved many operations overseas \u2013 to take advantage of lower costs in China and India and tax breaks in Ireland and Switzerland.",
      "The COVID-19 experience \u2013 when countries were desperate to hang onto their own medicine and medical supplies \u2014 underscored the dangers of relying on foreign countries in a crisis, especially when a key supplier is America\u2019s geopolitical rival China.",

      "Several big drugmakers like Merck & Co. Inc., Eli Lilly and Co. and Johnson & Johnson have already announced U.S. expansion plans.",
      "In his tariff announcement, Trump did not mention generic drugs, which account for the vast majority of U.S. prescriptions.",
      "Still, analysts warn, the tariffs are likely to mean higher prices. \u201cThe people who are punished the most are Americans who need the drugs so badly, especially those who don\u2019t have full health care plans,\u201d Appleton said. He called the tariff is a \u201csimplistic but drastic\u201d approach to a complicated problem. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to go, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to do well for consumers,\u201d he said.",
      "The tariffs on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture come as the White House is investigating whether imports of lumber and other wood products pose a threat to U.S. national security. A report on that investigation is due Nov. 26 and could mean more and broader tariffs.",
      "The levies are likely to hurt big furniture exporters China and Vietnam.",
      "But they\u2019re also likely to drive up the cost of new homes and apartments and of do-it-yourself redecorating projects.",
      "Homeowners are already scaling back due to high costs and a shaky economy. According to the Labor Department, the price of living room, kitchen and dining room furniture has risen nearly 10% over the past year.",
      "\u201cAdding significant costs to furniture, cabinets, vanities and building materials will make the American dream of owning a home significantly more expensive,\u201d said Jonathan Gold, the National Retail Federation\u2019s vice president of supply chain and customs policy. \u201cThe speed at which these tariff announcements are made and implemented continues to wreak havoc on retail supply chains. The uncertainty makes it difficult for retailers to properly plan and mitigate the impact of tariffs.\u201d",
      "Charles Clevenger, a supply chain specialist at the consultancy UHY, said tariffs on pharmaceuticals make sense because so much production has shifted away from the United States to Europe and Asia. Likewise, North Carolina and other states in the American South have also lost furniture factories to cheaper competitors in the China.",
      "But he was surprised by the tariffs on heavy trucks because \u201cwe do have a rather robust industry\u2019\u2019 \u2013 with manufacturers like Paccar (parent company of Peterbilt and Kenworth).",
      "But Appleton at New York Law School suspects the tariff is aimed at Mexico, where many heavy trucks are made. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal negotiated in Trump\u2019s first term, is coming up for negotiation. \u201cI don\u2019t think that (the tariff) was done by accident, Appleton said. \u201cThey wanted to put some more pressure onto the Mexicans\u201d to make concessions in the talks.",
      "Using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Trump had launched investigations into whether imports of pharmaceuticals, lumber and heavy trucks posed a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "He\u2019d justified his broader tariffs another way: by declaring national emergencies under a 1977 law. But two courts have ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose import taxes. The Supreme Court is hearing the case on appeal.",
      "Robert Lawrence, a professor of International trade and investment at Harvard University, said that using Section 232 gives the president a Plan B if the courts strike down his IEEPA tariffs. \u201cHe now has insurance and shows that he\u2019s going to be able to get away with raising tariffs, even if he loses that case.\u201d",
      "But Ted Murphy, co-leader of the trade practice at the Sidley Austin law firm, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to discern much of a plan ... What the administration does is they identify a problem and then the solution is a big tariff. The question is whether that\u2019s really as nuanced or strategic as it could be. There could be a strategy but it\u2019s hard to discern from a tweet.\u2019\u2019",

      "Here's what you need to know about potential cesium 137 contamination:",
      "Cesium 137 is a radioactive isotope created as a byproduct of nuclear reactions, including nuclear bombs, testing, reactor operations and accidents. It\u2019s widespread around the world, with trace amounts found in the environment, including soil, food and air.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials detected cesium 137 in shipping containers of shrimp sent by PT Bahari Makmur Sejati to several U.S. ports. CBP officials flagged the potential contamination to the FDA, which tested samples of the shrimp and detected cesium 137 in one sample of breaded shrimp.",
      "The company has sent about 84 million pounds (38 million kilograms) of shrimp to U.S. ports this year, according to data from Import Genius, a trade data analysis company. It supplies about 6% of foreign shrimp imported in the U.S.",
      "This month, FDA officials detected cesium 137 in one sample of cloves exported by PT Natural Java Spice, which sends spices to the U.S. and other countries. Records show the company sent about 440,000 pounds ( 200,000 kilograms) of cloves to the U.S. this year.",
      "No food that triggered alerts or tested positive has been released for sale in the U.S., FDA officials emphasized.",
      "But hundreds of thousands of packages of imported frozen shrimp sold at Kroger and other grocery stores across the U.S. have been recalled because they may have been manufactured under conditions that allowed them to be contaminated, the agency said.",
      "Although the risk appears to be small, the foods could pose a \u201cpotential health concern\u201d for people exposed to low levels of cesium 137 over time.",

    "story": [
      "The Washington attorney who brokered book deals for Barack Obama, George W. Bush and dozens of other government leaders has died at age 79",
      "NEW YORK -- Robert B. Barnett, a powerhouse Washington attorney who became a fixture in the political and publishing worlds as the literary representative for Barack and Michelle Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton and dozens of other leaders, has died at age 79.",
      "Barnett's executive assistant, Ashley Duffy, told The Associated Press that he died Thursday night. Additional details were not immediately available.",
      "A stocky, raspy-voiced man with tortoise shell glasses, antique cuff links and a knack for being both forthright and discrete, Bob Barnett embodied an era when it was possible to work freely with both Democrats and Republicans and politics could stop at the edge of a good book deal. He was a longtime Democrat, working on Jimmy Carter's 1976 campaign and helping Bill Clinton and other candidates in debate preparation. But he would broker contracts for such a wide range of political figures that he liked to joke that should his clients all gather in one room the result would be \u201cWorld War III.\u201d",
      "He was a partner at the high-end law firm Williams & Connolly, and for more than 20 years no one approached his stature as an intermediary between the Washington elite and New York publishers. From the early 1990s through the end of the Obama administration, in 2017, Barnett represented three consecutive presidents and first ladies \u2014 the Clintons, George W. and Laura Bush and the Obamas \u2014 and much of the remaining A-list political players, from Ted Kennedy and Mitch McConnell to Dick Cheney and Joe Biden, from Paul Ryan and Donald Rumsfeld to Al Franken and Elizabeth Warren.",
      "Barnett was called upon so often by politicians leaving office that he became known as \u201cthe doorman to Washington\u2019s revolving door.\u201d",
      "He was not an agent, he liked to point out, but an attorney who billed clients by the hour instead of receiving a percentage of royalties. It was a unique business arrangement that priced out the average writer, but well rewarded Obama, the Clintons and others who landed multi-million dollar deals.",
      "The general public could have made good money betting on Barnett's authors to prevail in elections. In six consecutive presidential races, from 1992-2012, a current or future Barnett client was elected, often defeating a non-Barnett client.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of the sagest advisers I\u2019ve ever been able to call upon,\u201d Republican strategist Karl Rove, a Barnett client and top aide to George W. Bush, told Politico in 2017. \u201cHe has counseled me on every professional decision I\u2019ve made.\"",
      "Barnett also handled negotiations for media executives and reporters (Roger Ailes, Bob Woodward, Chris Wallace), musical superstars (Elton John, Barbra Streisand), business leaders (Jack Welch, Phil Knight), international leaders (former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Queen Noor of Jordan) and one of the world's best-selling novelists, James Patterson. For years, he was not only representing presidents, but Jake Tapper, Brit Hume and other White House reporters who covered them. One of the best-selling political novels in recent years, \u201cThe President Is Missing,\u201d was a collaboration conceived by Barnett for Patterson and Bill Clinton.",
      "His political winning streak ended after 2016 when non-client Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. He was disdainful of Trump and eventually overtaken by the Creative Artists Agency and such younger Washington players as the Javelin literary agency.",
      "Asked in 2012 by the British law firm Chamber Associates how he wanted to be remembered, Barnett responded. \u201c\u2018He was loyal, kept confidences, and tried his best. He was a good husband, father, grandfather, counselor, and friend.\" Around the same time, Obama offered a wryer take, as recorded in Mark Leibovich\u2019s bestselling political chronicle \u201cThis Town.\u201d",

      "Barnett was part of the team helping Obama prepare for his 2012 debates with Republican challenger Mitt Romney, and was known among the president\u2019s advisers for his quintessentially insider observations. When Barnett prefaced one of his comments with \u201cthe conventional wisdom is,\u201d Obama responded, \u201cBob, you ARE the conventional wisdom.\u201d",
      "In 1972, Barnett married Rita Braver, a fellow graduate of the University of Wisconsin and a future CBS television correspondent. They had a daughter, Meredith.",
      "A native of Waukegan, Illinois, Robert Bruce Barnett graduated as senior class president from Waukegan High School, majored in political science at the University of Wisconsin and received a law degree from the University of Chicago. He moved to Washington in the early 1970s, clerking for Supreme Court Justice Byron White and working as aide to then-Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota. In 1975, he joined Williams & Connolly, and was made a partner three years later. Beyond his political clients, he also represented numerous corporations and businesses, including Deutsche Bank, McDonald's and JM Family Enterprises.",
      "Barnett did not plan his rise in book publishing. He had helped Vice Presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro prepare for her 1984 debate against George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan's vice president, and consulted with her when reports came out about her husband's alleged ties to organized crime. After the election, Ferraro asked him to help find a publisher for her memoir. Barnett, as inexperienced about publishing a book as Ferraro was about writing one, worked with New York agent Esther Newberg on a 7-figure deal with Bantam Books. Soon after, he arranged a lucrative deal for David Stockman, the first budget director in the Reagan administration.",
      "Among political leaders, he was especially close to the Clintons. They turned to him when White House aide and family friend Vince Foster killed himself in 1993 and when news broke that Bill Clinton had an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. His influence was never greater than in 2008, during the Democratic presidential primary. The main contenders were his longtime client, Hillary Clinton, and a new client, Obama, who had dropped his previous agent and turned to Barnett to make a deal for \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d one of history's bestselling political books and a key factor in his stunning rise.",
      "After a long and emotional primary campaign, Clinton, who had been heavily favored, conceded in June 2008 and began negotiating her role at the Democratic National Convention. The negotiations were handled by Barnett. By the end of the year, Obama had been elected (defeating the non-Barnett client Sen. John McCain) and Barnett was arranging a multi-million dollar deal for another client, the outgoing president, George W. Bush.",

      "The Minnesota Twins have fired manager Rocco Baldelli, ending his seven-year tenure that included three AL Central titles after a second straight disappointing season",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Twins fired manager Rocco Baldelli on Monday, ending his seven-year tenure that included three AL Central titles after a second straight disappointing season.",
      "Minnesota announced Baldelli's firing following a season marked by a major selloff leading up to the trade deadline after the team faltered in June and failed to mount any momentum in July. The Twins (70-92) went 19-35 after the deadline passed following the departure of 10 players off their major league roster, with only the Colorado Rockies faring worse over the final two months.",
      "The Twins finished with the fourth-worst record in the major leagues and their worst mark since 2016, when they went 59-103 after firing longtime general manager Terry Ryan at midseason. Current team president Derek Falvey was hired to replace Ryan after that.",
      "\"Over the past seven years Rocco has been much more than our manager. He has been a trusted partner and teammate to me in leading this organization,\u201d Falvey said in a statement. \u201cTogether we shared a deep care for the Twins, for our players and staff, and for doing everything in our power to put this club in the best position to succeed. Along the way we experienced some meaningful accomplishments, and I will always be proud of those, even as I wish we had ultimately achieved more.",
      "\u201cThis is a difficult day because of what Rocco represents to so many people here. He led with honesty, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to our players and staff. He gave himself fully to this role and I have tremendous respect and gratitude for the way he carried himself and the way he showed up every single day.\"",
      "For the second straight year, uncertainty around Baldelli\u2019s status hovered around the club. The Twins, who went 87-75 in 2023 to win their third AL Central title under Baldelli and their first series in the playoffs in 21 years, were in firm control of a wild-card spot down the stretch last season before tumbling out of contention with a 12-27 record over the last six weeks to land at 82-80.",
      "Factoring that finish into their extended funk this year, the Twins are 82-119 over their last 201 games for a .408 winning percentage. That includes a 13-game winning streak they produced earlier this season.",
      "Attendance has swooned at Target Field, with the Twins finishing with an 81-home game total of a little more than 1.7 million tickets sold, their lowest number in a non-pandemic season since 2000 when they played at the Metrodome and finished 69-93. Fans have mostly directed their disdain toward ownership, with deep frustration over cost-cutting that came after the 2023 breakthrough. The Pohlad family put the franchise up for sale last year, but decided last month to keep control and bring on two new investment groups for an infusion of cash to help pay down debt.",
      "The dizzying trade-deadline activity left Baldelli and his staff without much to work with down the stretch, though All-Star center fielder Byron Buxton was a bright spot in a breakthrough season for his health and rookie second baseman Luke Keaschall provided consistent production and a professional approach at the plate belying his inexperience.",

      "The Twins traded their five best relievers, from closer Jhoan Duran on down, and left the final 54 games to a ragtag group that had eight blown saves in 18 opportunities during that span. The conversion rate of 44.4% ranked second-worst in the major leagues over the final two months.",
      "Baldelli was hired before the 2019 season to replace Hall of Famer Paul Molitor, with Falvey citing his adaptivity to the data-based direction of baseball strategy and his communication skill in distilling it to coaches and players and clearly setting expectations and preferences.",
      "Particularly in this modern age of analytics, there\u2019s plenty of mystery about just how much impact a manager in the dugout truly has on a baseball team\u2019s won-loss record, but the overall performance \u2014 even with the post-trade deadline roster depletion this year \u2014 and lack of life from the club lately suggested some type of staffing change would be warranted.",

      "Now, another change.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not ideal but unfortunately we talked about it a lot what the standards are for the Giants and we have high standards,\u201d Posey said. \u201cAnd I hold myself to those same standards. I understand fully the position that I\u2019m in now. My job and the team\u2019s success is evaluated accordingly as well. You without a doubt hope that there can be consistency in these leadership positions. We\u2019ve got to get back to a place where we\u2019re getting in the playoffs, we\u2019re making runs in playoffs. That\u2019s what our fan base deserves, that\u2019s what the city deserves.\u201d",
      "As Posey begins finalizing his list of candidates, one familiar name has come up as a possibility: the catcher's former manager, Bruce Bochy.

      "Micah Parsons' much-anticipated return to Dallas to face his former Cowboys teammates ended with a 40-40 tie.",
      "The Cowboys' Brandon Aubrey and Green Bay's Brandon McManus traded short field goals in overtime Sunday night, and Parsons\u2019 only sack played a role in keeping Dallas out of the end zone in the extra period. It was the second time the Cowboys played into overtime this season and another showcase for the league's tweak of its overtime rule.",
      "The league approved a proposal to make regular-season overtime more like the postseason, with both teams getting a chance at a possession, even if the team that gets the ball first scores a touchdown.",
      "The NFL instituted regular-season overtime in 1974, adding a 15-minute sudden-death period that ended on any score. In 2010, the rule was tweaked to a modified sudden death that required an opening possession touchdown to immediately end the game instead of only a field goal. That was in effect in both the regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Overtime then was shortened for the regular season to only 10 minutes in 2017. A rule change in 2022 for the playoffs gave both teams the chance to score even with a touchdown on the opening possession.",
      "Now that's the case in the regular season, after the improved field position on kickoffs made winning in OT on an opening possession TD easier.",
      "According to Sportradar, six of the 16 overtime games last season ended on an opening-drive TD for the most overtime games ended on the first drive since the rule change went into effect in 2010.",

      "The league kept the 10-minute overtime period instead of expanding it back to 15 minutes like was originally proposed by Philadelphia, which could lead to teams opting to go for 2 and a win if they match an opening-drive TD with one of their own since there might not be time for another possession.",

      "By the age of 19 Kylian Mbappe had already won the World Cup, become one of the most expensive soccer players ever and was labeled the heir-apparent to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo",
      "MANCHESTER, England -- By the age of 19 Kylian Mbappe had won the World Cup, become one of the most expensive soccer players ever and was labeled the heir-apparent to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Seven years later, and with Messi and Ronaldo long past their peak, Mbappe is still to be officially recognized as the best player in the world.",
      "If anything, he is going backward.",
      "By the most recent measure he was ranked seventh. That's where he placed in this year's voting for the Ballon d'Or \u2014 the sport's biggest individual prize \u2014 which, last week, was won by Mbappe's France teammate Ousmane Dembele.",
      "\u201cYou deserve it x1000,\u201d Mbappe graciously posted on social media.",
      "In second place was teenage sensation Lamine Yamal \u2014 a player of such prodigious talent that he is now the one predicted to dominate the Ballon d'Or. A new generation is threatening to usurp Mbappe before he's even established himself at the top.",
      "\u201cThe challenges do seem to be getting bigger for him to go to the top,\u201d author Luca Caioli told The Associated Press. Caioli co-wrote the book \u201cMbappe\u201d chronicling his rise from prodigy to superstar.",
      "He said the emergence of the 18-year-old Yamal places doubts over whether Mbappe would become a multiple Ballon d'Or winner.",
      "\u201cNow it could be very complicated because of the fascination of this young player of 18 years that broke all the records for (someone his) age,\u201d said Caioli. \u201cAlso the age starts to be interesting for Mbappe. He's not 19 years old like when he won the World Cup. It\u2019s changed.\u201d",
      "Yamal, who has already led Spain to a European Championship and Barcelona to the Spanish title in his nascent career, won the Kopa trophy for the best under-21 player for the second year running. But there were claims he deserved the top prize, which would have made him the youngest ever recipient of the Ballon d'Or - overtaking Brazil striker Ronaldo, who won it aged 21.",
      "La Liga president Javier Tebas said the forward was only overlooked because of his age. Yamal\u2019s father said his son was the \u201cbest player in the world by far.\u201d",
      "There was no such outrage in response to Mbappe missing out. Not even from his club, Real Madrid, which last year boycotted the ceremony when Vinicius Junior was beaten to the prize by Manchester City midfielder Rodri.",
      "Frankly, Mbappe was barely part of the conversation this year despite winning the Golden Shoe as the top scorer in Europe.",
      "But at the age of 26, Mbappe's levels are not dropping. The Golden Shoe was the first of his career and last month he moved past Thierry Henry's total of 51 goals for France. He is now just six short of overtaking Olivier Giroud as his country's all-time leading scorer.",
      "He was the first teenager since Brazil great Pele to score in a World Cup final when France won in 2018. And he followed that four years later by becoming only the second player to score a hat trick in the final when France lost on penalties against Argentina.",
      "He left Paris Saint-Germain as the club's all-time top scorer.",
      "Yet despite the comments by Tebas and Yamal\u2019s father, few could say Dembele was not a deserved winner of the Ballon d'Or as the star player of a PSG team that won the Champions League and the French league and Cup, scoring 32 goals.",
      "While it was a year of personal redemption for Dembele, whose career had stalled after a move to Barcelona in 2017, it also happened to come in the first season after Mbappe's years-long-trailed transfer from PSG to Madrid.",

      "\u201cHe made a beautiful season. He is a European Golden Boot (winner) \u2026 But he found one of the worst years for Real Madrid,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he waited too long to go to Madrid \u2026 and then chooses the wrong moment.\u201d",
      "The Ballon d'Or is an imperfect way to determine the best player in the world. Ultimately it is a matter of opinion \u2014 voted for by one journalist from each of FIFA's top 100-ranked nations. The criteria includes individual and team performances, \u201cdecisive and impressive character\u201d and \u201cclass and fair play.\u201d",
      "It is, however, often weighted towards the best player in a team that wins the Champions League or a major international competition like the World Cup in any given year.",
      "Which is why Mbappe could consider himself unfortunate to miss out after winning the World Cup with France in 2018 when he placed fourth. The winner that year was Luka Modric, who was runner up in the World Cup with Croatia and won the Champions League with Madrid.",
      "\u201cI did everything I could, but not everything I could to win a Ballon d\u2019Or,\u201d Mbappe said at the time. \u201cIt shows me how much I still have to do to win this trophy or it would be too easy to get there and win it all at once.\u201d",
      "Mbappe's highest placing in the Ballon d'Or came in 2023 after his World Cup final hat trick. The winner that year was Messi, who led Argentina to victory at the Qatar tournament.",
      "The expectation that Mbappe could dominate the Ballon d'Or was based on the standards set by Messi and Ronaldo, who won it a combined 13 times. It was predicted that he and Man City striker Erling Haaland would develop a similar rivalry, but Yamal's emergence has changed that.",
      "\u201cHe is the present and, without a doubt, has a great future,\u201d Messi has said of Yamal.",
      "\u201cWe have seen a genius, the product of a genius,\u201d Spain coach Luis de la Fuente said of the teenager, who passed Pele as the youngest player to win a major international tournament as part of Spain's Euro 2024 team.",
      "A rivalry between Madrid's Mbappe and Barcelona's Yamal would emulate that of Ronaldo and Messi who also spent the height of their careers at Spain's two biggest clubs.",
      "And time is still on Mbappe\u2019s side. He is just reaching his peak years and has joined European soccer's most successful team in Madrid, which has won a record 15 Champions League titles.",
      "It seems improbable Mbappe wouldn't win European club soccer's top prize at least once with the Spanish giant. Especially if he continues to score at the rate he has so far.",
      "This season alone he has scored 12 goals in 10 games for Madrid and France, including two against Levante a day after the Ballon d\u2019Or ceremony.",
      "Given Dembele had to wait until he was 28 to win the trophy, he can serve as inspiration for Mbappe, who is 19 months his junior.",

      "But it at the post-match presentation ceremony where tensions reached boiling point.",
      "The ceremony was first delayed for unclear reasons for over one-and-a-half hours. The Pakistan team, led by captain Salman Agha, then arrived late for the ceremony. However, there was a further delay as the Indian team refused to accept the trophy from Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Interior Minister of Pakistan.",
      "India\u2019s Twenty20 skipper Suryakumar Yadav claimed that his team was denied the chance to lift the 2025 Asia Cup trophy.",
      "\u201cThis is one thing which I have never seen since I started playing cricket, started following cricket \u2013 a champion team is denied a trophy, that too a hard earned one,\u201d said Yadav in the post-match media conference. \u201cI feel we deserved it. And I can\u2019t say anything more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you tell me about trophies, mine are sitting in the dressing room, all 14 guys with me, the support staff \u2013 those are the real trophies throughout this journey in the Asia Cup.\u201d",
      "A statement on the ACC website had stated on Saturday that Naqvi would hand over the trophy to the Asia Cup winners. However, it is understood that the Indian team did not want to receive the trophy from him \u2013 in line with their refusal to shake hands with the Pakistan team in any of the three matches the two sides played during the tournament, both at the coin toss and at the end of the match.",
      "While the Indian team had refused to accept the trophy from Naqvi, he reportedly refused to step down from the presentation ceremony altogether. Before the ceremony began, an official also removed the Asia Cup trophy from the presentation podium. No explanation was provided from the ACC for this action.",
      "\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight. So that does conclude the post-match presentation,\u201d Simon Doull, former New Zealand cricketer and broadcaster, announced.",

      "All three received their awards from sponsor representatives, and did not acknowledge or shake hands with Naqvi on the presentation stage.",

      "Eventually, the Indian team celebrated without the trophy or its individual winners\u2019 medals.",
      "\u201cWe have decided not to take the Asia Cup trophy from the ACC chairman, who happens to be one of the main leaders of Pakistan,\u201d BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told Indian news media outlet, ANI. \u201cBut that does not mean that the gentleman will take away the trophy with him, along with the medals. So it is very unfortunate and we hope that the trophy and the medals will be returned to India as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cThere is an ICC conference in November in Dubai. In the next conference, we are going to launch a very serious and very strong protest against the act of the ACC chairperson.\u201d",

      "TORONTO -- The Toronto Blue Jays capped a turnaround from worst to first by holding off the New York Yankees to win the AL East on the final day of the season, their first division title in a decade and the seventh in team history.",
      "\u201cThe job is not finished,\u201d slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. said after a 13-4 win over the Tampa Bay Rays that clinched the division crown and secured a bye into the Division Series. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to continue to play hard and play good baseball.\u201d",
      "The Blue Jays finished 74-88 a season ago, last in the AL East and 20 games behind the first-place Yankees.",
      "\u201cI think everybody believed that last year was not who we were as a team,\u201d outfielder George Springer said. \u201cFrom day one of spring training you could kind of feel the vibe.\u201d",
      "This year, a four-game sweep over New York from June 30 to July 3 was part of a season-best 10-game winning streak that vaulted Toronto into the division lead for good.",
      "\u201cOnce we kind of hit our stride, we didn\u2019t think anyone could beat us,\u201d manager John Schneider said. \u201cThis is, in my opinion, the toughest division in the game. I don\u2019t think anyone, besides the people that are here soaking wet like me, expected us to be in this position.\u201d",
      "Toronto lost six of seven down the stretch, falling into a first-place tie with New York, but held onto the top spot in the American League by winning its final four games.",
      "\u201cWe almost broke at the end but, from that point on, we didn't break in the division,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cThat was obviously a huge four games for us.\u201d",
      "The Blue Jays won eight of 13 meetings with the Yankees this season, giving them the tiebreaker after both teams finished 94-68.",
      "Springer hit one of four Blue Jays home runs in Sunday\u2019s rout, his latest drive in a productive season that seemed unlikely in 2024, when the 2017 World Series MVP struggled through one of the worst years of his career, hitting just .220.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t say enough about him,\u201d Schneider said of Springer. \u201cFitting that his last at-bat was a home run. He\u2019s the heart and soul of our team. He\u2019s infectious when he plays and he\u2019s infectious in the clubhouse.\u201d",

      "Game 1 will be Saturday in Toronto, and the Blue Jays have home-field advantage throughout the AL playoffs after finishing with the top record in the American League.",
      "Arguably no one needs the break more than shortstop Bo Bichette. The two-time AL hits leader and two-time All-Star hasn\u2019t played since Sept. 6, when he injured his left knee in a collision with Yankees catcher Austin Wells.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of exactly what we needed,\u201d Schneider said of the five-day break before the Division Series. \u201cI hope that (Bichette) gets a chance to contribute to this. He\u2019s been instrumental to what we\u2019ve been doing here the last six years.\u201d",
      "Bichette has been hitting off a tee and throwing but has yet to resume running.",
      "\u201cEvery day I\u2019m feeling better,\u201d Bichette said. \u201cI\u2019ll be doing everything that I possibly can to get back.\u201d",
      "Toronto hasn't won a postseason game since losing the American League Championship Series to Cleveland in 2016. The Blue Jays won wild-card berths in 2020, 2022 and 2023 but were swept by Tampa Bay, Seattle and Minnesota, respectively.",

      "\u201cThese last few months have been filled with a lot of healing, rest, and reflection,\u201d Watkins said on Instagram. \u201cRecovering from this injury hasn\u2019t been easy, and I want to say thank you \u2014 your love, support and kind words have truly lifted me up during one of the most challenging times in my life. Because you\u2019ve been with me every step of the way, I wanted you to hear it from me directly that following the advice of my doctors and trainers, I will sit out this season and fully focus on continuing to recover so I can come back to the game I love.\u201d",

The AP started giving out the award in 1995, and Watkins is the first Trojans player to win it.",
      "\u201cJuJu\u2019s health and well-being are our top priority, and we fully support her decision to focus on recovery this season,\u201d USC women\u2019s basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cWhile we will certainly miss her impact on the court, she continues to play a vital role in our program as a leader and teammate. The strength and maturity she has shown through this process is a reflection of who she is, and we know the Trojan Family will continue to rally behind her. We look forward to the day she returns to competition stronger than ever.\u201d",

      "Watkins is already in the top 10 on USC\u2019s career scoring list, ranking ninth. She was averaging 23.9 points, 6.8 rebounds and 3.4 assists before her season was cut short in the NCAA Tournament with the ACL injury suffered in the second round against Mississippi State.",

Texas pinch-hitter Rowdy Tellez put the Rangers up 8-5 with a three-run homer in the 10th, but the Guardians came back again with Bo Naylor's RBI double in the bottom half and then Rocchio's three-run drive down the right-field line that hit the foul pole and gave them a 9-8 victory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible. I think not only because of the homer and the walk off, but knowing that we were going to win the division the right way. We knew we had at that point, but winning the game was really important for us,\u201d Rocchio said through an interpreter in the celebratory Cleveland clubhouse.",
      "The second baseman has symbolized the Guardians' second-half rally from 15 1/2 games behind Detroit in early July.",
      "Rocchio was a Gold Glove finalist at shortstop and a catalyst in Cleveland's run to the American League Championship Series last season. But he started this year batting .165 in 35 games before being optioned to Triple-A Columbus on May 12.",
      "Since being recalled on July 1, Rocchio not only rediscovered his hitting stroke, but he moved to second base.",
      "His .257 batting average the last three months of the season was second on the team to Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (.258). Rocchio also was third on the club in RBIs (36) and doubles (15).",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been one of our best hitters since he\u2019s come back. And for him to hit that walk-off, it\u2019s super emblematic of our season,\u201d manager Stephen Vogt said. \u201cWe never quit. Every setback is an opportunity to get better and Rocchio embodies that better than anybody.\u201d",
      "Rocchio admitted there was a lack of confidence when he got sent down, but said he's proud of the work he put in to make it back.",
      "\u201cI felt like I was digging from something within, something that I couldn\u2019t know to get that strength to come back, to keep being resilient and keep fighting. So I think it\u2019s that sense of pride that I was able to show what I\u2019m capable of doing,\u201d he said.",
      "The Guardians are hoping Rocchio provides the same offensive spark he did during the postseason last year. The 24-year-old Venezuelan infielder went 11 for 33 in 10 games, including an eight-game hitting streak.",

      "\u201cWhat happened here this week is not acceptable,\u201d McIlroy said on Sunday after going 3-1-1 to help Europe beat the United States 15-13. His lone loss came in a Sunday singles match with world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who had also played in all five sessions, that was more of a slog than a pristine, shot-for-shot battle of the world\u2019s top two players.",
      "It was McIlroy\u2019s most blunt assessment yet of a New York crowd that Europe fully expected to be rowdy and passionate \u2014 captain Luke Donald even gave players virtual-reality goggles to get used to the noise \u2014 but maybe not this crass or downright obnoxious.",
      "The 36-year-old Northern Irishman, who came to Bethpage on a mission to win his second Ryder Cup on U.S. soil, sometimes pushed back \u2014 whirling around and cursing at his hecklers or stepping away from a shot until the riled masses settled down.",
      "On Saturday, he told boisterous fans to \u201cshut the (expletive) up\u201d before knocking his approach to 3 feet to set up a clinching putt in a morning foursomes match. When a fan yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re not that good, Rory!\u201d he responded: \u201cI\u2019m (expletive) very good.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am,\u201d McIlroy added at the winners' press conference. \u201cReally good.\u201d",
      "While there was more golf to play, McIlroy stayed guarded in his post-match interviews. Asked on Saturday if he thought fans had crossed a line, he said: \u201cPeople can be their own judge of whether they took it too far or not.\u201d After all, he still had to deal with them on Sunday.",
      "With the crowds gone and the Ryder Cup in hand, the five-time major champion let loose.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we should ever accept that in golf,\u201d McIlroy told reporters, his European teammates and captain crowded around on the interview room dais. \u201cI think golf should be held to a higher standard than what was seen out there this week.\u201d",
      "Then he turned philosophical about the sport that has made him rich and popular, that he has worked at since he was a boy, that he has achieved so much in, including the career Grand Slam.",
      "\u201cGolf has the ability to unite people. Golf teaches you very good life lessons. It teaches you etiquette. It teaches you how to play by the rules. It teaches you how to respect people,\" McIlroy said. \u201cSometimes this week we didn\u2019t see that. So no, this should not be what is acceptable in the Ryder Cup.\u201d",
      "The culprits, he noted, were the minority of a crowd full of \u201ctrue golf fans\u201d who were \u201crespectful and let both teams have the same chance to hit the shots and play a fair contest.\u201d",

As European fans serenaded him with their go-to cheer, a version of a song by the Cranberries that replaces \u201cZombie\u201d with \u201cRory,\u201d American fans did everything they could to knock him off his game.",

      "Lowry assumed the role of bodyguard and bouncer as tensions rose during his and McIlroy\u2019s fourball match on Saturday. The Irishman told off fans and jawed with hecklers, thumping his chest, marching across the green and cursing at the crowd after sinking a pivotal putt.",
      "By Sunday, a European victory was all but assured. The visitors were up 11 1/2 to 4 1/2 going into the final round. No side had ever come back from such a deficit \u2014 and still hasn't.",

More than a dozen state troopers flanked their group and a marshal warned spectators to \u201ckeep it clean.\"",
      "In the end, it was McIlroy who had the final word. In April, he won the Masters after years of trying to complete the career grand slam. Now, he's won his sixth Ryder Cup in eight tries, improving his record in the event to 19-14-5. And the next one is a veritable home game, at Adare Manor in Ireland.",

      "The Baltimore Ravens? Pretty much the opposite of all of that.",
      "Patrick Mahomes threw for 270 yards and four touchdowns in a turn-back-the-clock kind of performance, and the Chiefs jumped on a Ravens team missing seven defensive starters by the end \u2014 to say nothing of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who had to leave with a hamstring injury \u2014 for a 37-20 victory in a matchup of AFC behemoths desperate for a win.",
      "Four different players caught TD passes for the Chiefs, while Xavier Worthy returned from a shoulder injury to catch five passes for 83 yards, igniting a Kansas City offense that had been struggling to find its footing through the first three weeks.",
      "\u201cWe've been making little mistakes here and there and that causes frustration,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cbut we've been learning from them. I've been proud of the guys for the way they've responded, getting better every week.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs (2-2) built a 20-10 halftime lead against Baltimore before cruising to their seventh win in the past eight meetings. The most recent time the Ravens (1-3) beat them was September 2021, and their previous win in Kansas City was on Oct. 7, 2021.",
      "Jackson threw for 147 yards with a touchdown and his first interception of the season before hurting his hamstring midway through the third quarter, though by that point the game was mostly decided. Cooper Rush played the rest of the way for the Ravens, who suddenly find themselves in a dire situation just four weeks into the season.",
      "Only five teams in the 14-team playoff era have started 1-3 and made the postseason.",
      "\u201cI'm concerned but I'm not overwhelmed by it. Three losses to probably three of the top teams in the league,\u201d said Ravens coach John Harbaugh, who explained that Jackson sustained a strain to his hamstring and will be evaluated further on Monday.",

      "While the Chiefs were getting healthier with the return of Worthy, the Ravens defense \u2014 already decimated by injuries \u2014 thinned even more when linebacker Roquan Smith, Marlon Humphrey and Nate Wiggins got hurt. That left the Ravens without seven defensive starters \u2014 among them two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike and pass rusher Broderick Washington Jr., who went on injured reserve Saturday \u2014 by the early minutes of the fourth quarter.",

      "The company is taking action after AI chatbot safety for young users has hit the headlines. The technology's dangers have been recently highlighted by a number of cases in which teenagers took their lives after interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has even opened an inquiry into several tech companies about the potential harms to children and teenagers who use their AI chatbots as companions.",
      "In a blog post posted Monday, OpenAI outlined the new controls for parents. Here is a breakdown:",
      "The parental controls will be available to all users, but both parents and teens will need their own accounts to take advantage of them.",
      "To get started, a parent or guardian needs to send an email or text message to invite a teen to connect their accounts. Or a teenager can send an invite to a parent. Users can send a request by going into the settings menu and then to the \"Parental controls\" section.",
      "Teens can unlink their accounts at any time, but parents will be notified if they do.",
      "Once the accounts are linked, the teen account will get some built-in protections, OpenAI said.",
      "Teen accounts will \u201cautomatically get additional content protections, including reduced graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent role-play, and extreme beauty ideals, to help keep their experience age-appropriate,\u201d the company said.",
      "Parents can choose to turn these filters off, but teen users don't have the option.",
      "OpenAI warns that such guardrails are \u201cnot foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\u201d It advised parents to talk with their children about \u201chealthy AI use.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump and his administration have embraced artificial intelligence-generated images, crafting a new official portrait of him",
      "WASHINGTON -- Here he is, depicted at six months in office, chiseled and brawny, as mighty as the very nation. Here he is as a Star Wars Jedi wielding a patriot-red lightsaber, rescuing our galaxy from the forces of evil. Here he is taking over Gaza, transforming the strip into a luxury resort complete with a golden effigy of himself.",
      "You can be anything, perhaps you were told growing up. Doctor. Astronaut. Maybe, one day, the president. But even the chief executive of the United States, the free world\u2019s leader, frames himself as something more epic \u2014 as someone not entirely himself.",
      "On the social media accounts of Donald Trump and his second-term administration, a new official image of the president is emerging bit by bit: one generated artificially.",
      "A sign of the times, certainly \u2014 when the appeal of reimagining yourself with artificial intelligence has trickled up from us everyday citizens. Bored with your selfies? Join a viral trend: There\u2019s an image generator or a chatbot that can turn you into a Renaissance-style painting, a Studio Ghibli character or an action figure with box art and accessories.",
      "Artificial imagery isn\u2019t new for Trump, an early target of AI-generated simulacra who later exploited the technology during his 2024 campaign for the presidency. \u201cIt works both ways,\u201d the Republican president said of AI-generated content at a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIf something happens that\u2019s really bad, maybe I\u2019ll have to just blame AI.\u201d",
      "The AI images of Trump posted by him and his team opt for the alternative \u2014 not deceptive but self-evident in their fictitiousness. Pope Francis dies, and Trump jokes to reporters that he\u2019d like to be pope. A week later, he is, but in an AI-generated image that he posts, reposted by the White House. Trump likens himself to a king in a Truth Social post in February, and AI makes him one in an X post by the White House less than an hour later.",
      "The artifice arrives in Trump\u2019s usual style \u2014 brassy, unabashed, attention-grabbing \u2014 and squares with his social media team\u2019s heavy meme posting, which it has promised to continue. The administration\u2019s official social media accounts have grown by more than 16 million new followers across platforms since Inauguration Day, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "The White House recognizes the appeal. In July, it posted to its X account: \u201cNowhere in the Constitution does it say we can\u2019t post banger memes.\u201d Attached to the post, a photo of a sign on the White House lawn parodying the naysayers: \u201coMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHis?\u201d",
      "Behind the commander in chief\u2019s desire to craft an AI self \u2014 not itself uncommon \u2014 an infantry of official communications channels stands at his ready. And we, the people, can\u2019t help but tune in.",
      "Like so much on the internet these days, Trump\u2019s AI portraits are primed for people to react, says Evan Cornog, a political historian and author of \u201cThe Power and the Story: How the Crafted Presidential Narrative Has Determined Political Success from George Washington to George W. Bush.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy the time you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve understood it. And that\u2019s, of course, the efficacy,\u201d Cornog said. \u201cIt requires no effort, either for the person generating it, but particularly for the person consuming it.\u201d",
      "The expressive power of political imagery, regardless of the truth of its message, has long been understood by politicians and their detractors.",
      "President William Henry Harrison\u2019s log cabin and hard cider campaign symbols, representing him as a \u201cman of the people,\u201d helped him win the election of 1840. Thirty years later, political cartoonist Thomas Nast would turn public opinion against William Marcy \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed with his scathing portrayals of the politician, whom he depicted satirically overweight from greed. \u201cLet\u2019s stop those damned pictures!\u201d Tweed once said, or so the story goes.",
      "The decades since witnessed the birth of photo, film, TV, the internet, computer printers, image-editing software and digital screens that shrank until they could fit in our pockets, making it increasingly easy to create and disseminate \u2014 and manipulate \u2014 imagery.",
      "By contrast, today\u2019s generative AI technology offers greater realism, functionality and accessibility to content creation than ever before, says AI expert Henry Ajder. Not to mention, of course, a capacity for endless automated possibility.",
      "Past presidents \u201chad to actually have fought in a war to run as a war hero,\u201d Cornog says. Now, they can just generate an image of themselves as one. On a horse \u2014 or no, a battlefield. With an American flag waving behind him and an eagle soaring.",

      "Indeed, generative AI allows for an exposure of perhaps uncomfortably intimate inner worlds as people use such technology to illustrate and communicate their \u201cfantasy lives\u201d or cartoonish versions of themselves, says Mitchell Stephens, author of \u201cThe Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word.\u201d",
      "But it can just as easily fulfill an inverse desire: to depict or reinforce a subjective concept of reality.",
      "\u201cQuite a lot of people are sharing AI-generated content, which is clearly fake but is almost seen as a revelatory kind of representation of someone,\u201d Ajder said. This content feeds a mentality that mutters, \u201cWe all know they\u2019re really like this.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so, even if people know it\u2019s fake,\u201d Ajder said, \u201cthey still see it as kind of reflecting and satisfying a kind of truth \u2014 their truth about what the world is like.\u201d",
      "The lack of subtlety in Trump\u2019s AI images of himself helps explain their consistent virality.",

      "Does Trump really think he should be pope? Does the White House really think him a king? Accuracy isn\u2019t the point, not for a man who frequently arbitrates what counts as truth. Trump's use of AI sticks to a familiar recipe for bait: crude comedy sprinkled with wishful thinking.",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "\u201cTherapy is more than just word exchanges,\u201d Treto said. \"It requires empathy, it requires clinical judgment, it requires ethical responsibility, none of which AI can truly replicate right now.\u201d",
      "In March, a Dartmouth University-based team published the first known randomized clinical trial of a generative AI chatbot for mental health treatment.",
      "The goal was to have the chatbot, called Therabot, treat people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or eating disorders. It was trained on vignettes and transcripts written by the team to illustrate an evidence-based response.",
      "The study found users rated Therabot similar to a therapist and had meaningfully lower symptoms after eight weeks compared with people who didn't use it. Every interaction was monitored by a human who intervened if the chatbot\u2019s response was harmful or not evidence-based.",
      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",
      "\u201cThe space is so dramatically new that I think the field needs to proceed with much greater caution that is happening right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples\u2019 thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not.",
      "Therabot\u2019s team sought to avoid those issues.",
      "The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective.",
      "\u201cThey want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.\u201d",
      "Regulators and advocates of the laws say they are open to changes. But today's chatbots are not a solution to the mental health provider shortage, said Kyle Hillman, who lobbied for the bills in Illinois and Nevada through his affiliation with the National Association of Social Workers.",
      "\u201cNot everybody who's feeling sad needs a therapist,\u201d he said. But for people with real mental health issues or suicidal thoughts, \"telling them, \u2018I know that there\u2019s a workforce shortage but here's a bot' \u2014 that is such a privileged position.\u201d",

      "K\u0101rearea, the Indigenous M\u0101ori name for the New Zealand falcon, was crowned Bird of the Year on Monday. But the annual poll, run by conservation group Forest & Bird, is no ordinary online vote.",

      "\u201cBird of the Year has grown from a simple email poll in 2005 to a hotly contested cultural moment,\u201d said Forest & Bird Chief Executive Nicola Toki. \u201cBehind the memes and mayhem is a serious message.\u201d",
      "The contest draws attention to New Zealand\u2019s native bird species, with 80% designated as being in trouble to some degree. But it attracts passionate fandom because New Zealanders are bird-obsessed.",
      "In a country with no native land mammals except for two species of bat, birds reign supreme. They appear in art, on jewelry, in schoolchildren\u2019s songs, and in the name New Zealanders are known by abroad, \u201ckiwis.\u201d",
      "Beloved birds include alpine parrots that harass tourists and pigeons which get so drunk on berries that they sometimes fall out of trees.",

      "DR said that for a period of time, the airspace was closed to civil air traffic, but that didn't have much practical significance as there is currently no civil aviation in Karup.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Private investment firms that are helping finance America\u2019s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers \u2014 and the servers that power AI.",
      "Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.",
      "\u201cThe reason is very simple: because there\u2019s a lot of money to be made,\u201d said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.",
      "Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Brown said.",
      "BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is \u201cat the beginning of a golden age.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe believe that there\u2019s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy\" and energy, Fink said.",

      "Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.",
      "However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.",
      "Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.",
      "Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.",
      "Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.",
      "\u201cIt's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don\u2019t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,\u201d said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.",
      "The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers.",

      "On the other side are the state attorney general\u2019s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.",
      "In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price \u2014 $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium \u2014 to affect electric rates.",
      "In essence, Allete \u2014 which solicited bids for a buyout \u2014 argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota\u2019s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.",
      "Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.",
      "However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to meet its financing needs.",
      "It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.",
      "In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's \u201cintent to do what private equity is expected to do \u2013 pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.\u201d",
      "In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.",
      "They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.",
      "\u201cFor the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,\u201d the staff wrote. \u201cFor the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity \u2018wins\u2019 and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses \u2013 it is a lose-lose.\u201d",

      "Rep. John Moolenaar has requested an urgent briefing from the White House after Trump supported a deal giving Americans a majority stake in TikTok",
      "WASHINGTON -- The chairman of a House committee that pushed for the law demanding TikTok be spun off from its Chinese owners has requested an urgent briefing from the White House, one day after Trump signed an executive order supporting a proposed deal that would put the popular social video platform under U.S. ownership.",
      "In a statement released Friday, Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, praised the proposed deal as \"an important step\u201d in transitioning ownership of the TikTok platform to American hands but he emphasized that \u201cdivestment was not the law's only requirement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance,\u201d Moolenaar said.",
      "The Michigan Republican's statement marks the first congressional effort to conduct oversight into the negotiations over TikTok, coming nearly two weeks after Chinese and American officials met in Spain to discuss a framework divestment deal for TikTok. Trump on Thursday signed an executive order providing support for the deal, and said Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to move forward with negotiations.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to an inquiry from the Associated Press regarding the urgent briefing.",
      "Much is still unknown about the actual deal in the works, but the new U.S. venture would license the famed ByteDance-owned algorithm that currently keeps TikTok users engaged. U.S. tech giant Oracle, a confirmed partner in the U.S. investment consortium that would own TikTok, would audit the copy of the algorithm and monitor it for security purposes.",
      "Vice President JD Vance on Thursday assured the public that the deal would not only keep TikTok operating but also protect Americans' data privacy as required by law. Moolenaar on Friday said he would like to know more.",
      "While algorithms are valuable assets, the real value of TikTok is its users, which is likely why the consortium won\u2019t just start from scratch to build a new app, said computer scientist Bart Knijnenburg, an associate professor at Clemson University who has studied how recommendation systems steer people to online content.",
      "Knijnenburg said all algorithms are biased in some way and if the administration is serious about retraining the TikTok algorithm to avoid Chinese influence, it should push for \u201cradical openness\u201d in TikTok\u2019s mechanics so that users have a window into how bias might be influencing their feeds.",
      "More than politics, Knijnenburg said the biggest problem with TikTok\u2019s algorithm is that it\u2019s geared toward addictive engagement and overuse.",
      "\u201cMoving it to the U.S. is not going to magically solve these types of problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAny company might put undue influence on these applications and from a business perspective, the best way to engage users is to make them addicted to watching these videos, which is not a good idea.\u201d",
      "Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, doubts that the deal, as revealed so far, complies with the law.",
      "\u201cThe law is clear: divestiture means severance, not supervision,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cA board seat for ByteDance or any continued role in maintaining the algorithm would flout Congress\u2019s mandate.\"",
      "Though the details have yet to be finalized, the U.S. investment group\u2019s controlling stake in the new venture would be around 80%. While ByteDance is expected to have a stake in the new venture, it would be less than 20% \u2014 a portion of the ownership reserved for foreign investors. The board running the new platform would be controlled by U.S. investors. ByteDance will be represented by one person on the board, but that individual will be excluded from any security-related matters.",

      "Singleton argues that a board foothold by ByteDance is not merely symbolic. \u201cByteDance\u2019s reported role as the largest single shareholder in a restructured TikTok U.S. venture, combined with a board seat, ensures continuing Chinese influence over the app,\u201d he said. \u201cPlainly put, ByteDance on the board means Beijing in the building.\u201d",
      "Vance said he expects the new U.S.-based TikTok to be valued at about $14 billion, describing it as a \u201cgood deal\u201d for investors who must ultimately decide \u201cwhat they want to invest in and what they think is the proper value.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a \u201csurprisingly low\u201d valuation, said Daniel Keum, a management professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school.",
      "Keum said it\u2019s possible that \u201cpolitics overrode the business case\u201d or that the licensing structure, which hasn\u2019t yet been disclosed, could have been designed with high fees or profit-sharing that depressed the value of TikTok\u2019s app in the U.S.",

      "\u201cThis is a fair settlement,\u201d Alsup said, though he added that distributing it to all parties will be \u201ccomplicated.\u201d About 465,000 books are on the list of works pirated by Anthropic, according to Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors.",
      "\u201cWe have some of the best lawyers in America in this courtroom and if anyone can do it, you can,\" Alsup said.",
      "The Association of American Publishers called the settlement a \u201cmajor step in the right direction in holding AI developers accountable for reckless and unabashed infringement.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnthropic is hardly a special case when it comes to infringement. Every other major AI developer has trained their models on the backs of authors and publishers, and many have sourced those works from the most notorious infringing sites in the world,\u201d said Maria A. Pallante, president and CEO of the publisher group.",
      "San Francisco-based Anthropic said it is pleased with the preliminary approval.",
      "\u201cThe decision will allow us to focus on developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems. As we\u2019ve consistently maintained, the court\u2019s landmark June ruling that AI training constitutes transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement simply resolves narrow claims about how certain materials were obtained,\u201d said Aparna Sridhar, deputy general counsel at Anthropic.",
      "The Authors Guild, meanwhile, said the settlement \u201cmarks a milestone in authors\u2019 fights against AI companies\u2019 theft of their works. It sends a clear signal to AI companies that infringement of authors\u2019 rights comes at a steep price and will undoubtedly push AI companies towards acquiring the books they want legally, through licensing.\u201d",
      "A Monday filing sought to convince the judge that the parties have set up a system designed to get out robust notice to all authors and publishers covered by the agreement, ensuring they get their cut of the pot if they want to sign off on the settlement or opt out to protect their legal rights moving forward.",
      "They also tried to assure him that the author and publishers group that cobbled the deal together are not doing any \u201cback room\u201d dealings that would hurt lesser-known authors.",

      "It's the latest example of wildlife flourishing in polluted sites. Previous research has shown shipwrecks and former weapons complexes teeming with biodiversity.",
      "In the new study, researchers filmed networks of anemones, starfish and other underwater life in the Bay of L\u00fcbeck off the coast of Germany. They were lurking on pieces of V-1 flying bombs used by Nazi Germany.",
      "\u201cNormally, one does not study the ecology of bombs,\u201d said University of Georgia ecologist James Porter, who was not involved with the research.",
      "The research was published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment.",
      "Why would sea creatures make their home on contaminated weapons? They could be drawn to the hard surfaces, which are in short supply in the Baltic Sea. The seafloor is mainly a flat bed of mud and sand because stones and boulders were fished out of the water for construction in the 1800s and 1900s, Vedenin said.",

      "Humans first began foraging for food some 12,000 years ago, long before they developed agricultural tools that overshadowed the ancient act that helped sustain early humans",
      "PORTSMOUTH, N.H. -- Standing barefoot in a grassy patch of dandelions, Iris Phoebe Weaver excitedly begins listing the many ways the modest plant can be used medicinally and in cooking.",
      "\u201cI just picked a bunch of dandelion flowers yesterday and threw them in vodka with some orange peel and some sugar, and that\u2019s my dandelion aperitif,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThat will make a lovely mixed drink at some point.\u201d",
      "A longtime herbalist and foraging instructor in Massachusetts, Weaver takes people on nature walks that transform their relationships with their surroundings. Lately, she's been encouraged by the uptick in interest in foraging, a trend she sees as benefiting the environment, community and people.",
      "\u201cThere is just an amazing amount of food that is around us,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThere is so much abundance that we don\u2019t even understand.\u201d",
      "Humans have been foraging long before they developed the agricultural tools some 12,000 years ago that quickly overshadowed the ancient act that helped sustain early humans. Yet foraging enthusiasts say the search for wild mushrooms, edible plants, shellfish and seaweed has grown more popular in recent years as people tout their rare finds. Others share knowledge on social media, and experienced foragers offer training to novices on safe and sustainable practices.",
      "The renewed interest ranges from those wanting to be budget-conscious \u2014 foraging is free after all \u2014 to those wanting to be more mindful of their environmental footprint. Some even use foraging as a creative outlet, using mushrooms they find to create spore prints and other art.",
      "The popularity is also helped by the hobby's accessibility. Foragers can look for wild food everywhere, from urban landscapes to abandoned farmlands to forests \u2014 they just need permission from a private landowner or to secure the right permit from a state or federal park. Some advocates have even launched a map highlighting where people can pick fruits and vegetables for free.",
      "Gina Buelow, a natural resources field specialist with the Iowa University Extension Program, says the university has had a backlog of folks eager to learn more about foraging mushrooms for the past two years. Buelow runs presentations and field guide days throughout the state, regularly meeting the attendance cap of 30 in both rural and urban counties.",
      "\u201cTypically, I would get usually older women for a master gardener or pollinator garden class. That audience still shows up to these mushrooms programs, but they bring their husbands. And a lot of people between the ages of 20 and 30 years old are really interested in this topic, as well,\u201d she said.",
      "Some creative chefs are also sparking interest in foraging as they expose patrons to exotic and surprisingly tasty ingredients found locally.",
      "\u201cForaging is an ancient concept,\u201d said Evan Mallett, chef and owner of the Black Trumpet Bistro in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, a popular historic New England destination. \u201cOur culture has moved far away from foraging and is fortunately coming back into it now.\u201d",
      "Mallett opened the restaurant nearly 20 years ago and uses foods foraged from around Portsmouth. He said he hopes more people will continue to learn about foraging, and encouraged those worried about picking something poisonous to find a mentor.",

      "Former Vice President Al Gore has announced an expansion of Climate TRACE to track soot pollution using satellite technology and artificial intelligence",
      "NEW YORK -- Soon people will be able to use satellite technology and artificial intelligence to track dangerous soot pollution in their neighborhoods \u2014 and where it comes from \u2014 in a way not so different from monitoring approaching storms under plans by a nonprofit coalition led by former Vice President Al Gore.",
      "Gore, who started Climate TRACE, which uses satellites to monitor the location of heat-trapping methane sources, on Wednesday expanded his system to track the source and plume of pollution from tiny particles, often referred to as soot, on a neighborhood basis for 2,500 cities across the world. Particle pollution kills millions of people worldwide each year \u2014 and tens of thousands in the United States \u2014 according to scientific studies and reports.",
      "Gore's coalition uses 300 satellites, 30,000 ground-tracking sensors and artificial intelligence to track 137,095 sources of particle pollution, with 3,937 of them categorized as \u201csuper emitters\u201d for how much they spew. Users can look at long-term trends, but in about a year Gore hopes these can become available daily so they can be incorporated into weather apps, like allergy reports.",
      "It\u2019s not just seeing the pollutants. The website shows who is spewing them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, before AI, for people to really see precisely where this conventional air pollution is coming from,\u201d Gore said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s over in their homes and in their neighborhoods and when people have a very clear idea of this, then I think they\u2019re empowered with the truth of their situation. My faith tradition has always taught me you will know the truth and the truth shall set you free.\u201d",
      "Unlike methane, soot pollution isn't technically a climate issue because it doesn't cause the world to warm, but it does come from the same process: fossil fuel combustion.",

      "Louisiana has issued a warrant to arrest a California doctor accused of mailing abortion pills",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana is pursuing a criminal case against another out-of-state doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to a patient in the state, court documents filed this month revealed.",
      "A warrant for the arrest of a California doctor is a rare charge of violating one of the state abortion bans that has taken effect since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and allowed enforcement.",
      "It represents an additional front in a growing legal battle between liberal and conservative states over prescribing abortion medications via telehealth and mailing them to patients.",
      "Pills are the most common way abortions are accessed in the U.S., and are a major reason that, despite the bans, abortion numbers rose last year, according to a report.",
      "Louisiana said in a court case filed Sept. 19 that it had issued a warrant for a California-based doctor who it says provided pills to a Louisiana woman in 2023.",
      "Both the woman, Rosalie Markezich, and the state attorney's general, are seeking to be part of a lawsuit that seeks to order drug regulators to bar telehealth prescriptions to mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions.",
      "In court filings, Markezich says her boyfriend at the time used her email address to order drugs from Dr. Remy Coeytaux, a California physician, and sent her $150, which she forwarded to Coeytaux. She said she had no other contact with the doctor.",
      "She said she did not want to take the pills but felt forced to and said in the filing that \u201cthe trauma of my chemical abortion still haunts me\u201d and that it would not have happened if telehealth prescriptions to the drug were off limits.",
      "The accusation builds on a position taken by anti-abortion groups: That allowing abortion pills to be prescribed by phone or video call and filled by mail opens the door to women being coerced to take them.",
      "\u201cRosalie is bravely representing many woman who are victimized by the illegal, immoral, and unethical conduct of these drug dealers,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement.",
      "Murrill's office did not immediately answer questions about what charges Coeytaux faces, or when the warrant was issued. But under the state's ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, physicians convicted of providing abortion face up to 15 years in prison and $200,000 in fines.",
      "Coeytaux is also the target of a lawsuit filed in July in federal court by a Texas man who says the doctor illegally provided his girlfriend with abortion pills.",
      "Coeytaux did not immediately respond to emails or a phone message.",

      "U.S. House members have met in North Carolina's largest city to hear from families of violent-crime victims",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- U.S. House members visited North Carolina's largest city on Monday to hear from family members of violent-crime victims who pleaded for tougher criminal justice policies in the wake of last month's stabbing death of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte commuter train.",
      "A judiciary subcommittee meeting convened in Charlotte to listen to many speakers who described local court systems in North Carolina and South Carolina that they say have failed to protect the public and keep defendants in jail while awaiting trials.",
      "The meeting was prompted by the Aug. 22 stabbing death of Iryna Zarutska on a light rail car and the resulting apprehension of a suspect who had been previously arrested more than a dozen times.",
      "\u201cThe same system that failed Mary failed Iryna. Our hearts are broken for her family and her friends and we grieve with them,\u201d Mia Alderman, the grandmother of 2020 murder victim Mary Santina Collins in Charlotte, told panelists. Alderman said defendants in her granddaughter's case still haven't been tried: \u201cWe need accountability. We need reform. We need to ensure that those accused of heinous crimes are swiftly prosecuted.\u201d",
      "A magistrate had allowed the commuter train defendant, Decarlos Brown Jr., to be released on a misdemeanor charge in January on a written promise to appear, without any bond. Now Brown is charged with both first-degree murder in state court and a federal count in connection with Zarutska\u2019s death. Both crimes can be punishable by the death penalty.",
      "Public outrage intensified with the release of security video showing the attack, leading to accusations from Republicans all the way to President Donald Trump that policies by Democratic leaders in Charlotte and statewide are more focused on helping criminals than victims. Democratic committee members argued that Republicans are the ones who have reduced crime-control funds or failed to provide funding for more district attorneys and mental health services.",
      "\u201cThe hearing for me is not really about public safety,\u201d Democratic Rep. Alma Adams, who represents most of Charlotte. \u201cIt\u2019s about my colleagues trying to paint Democrats as soft on crime \u2014 and we're not \u2014 and engaging in political theater, probably to score some headlines.\u201d",
      "Dena King, a former U.S. attorney for western North Carolina during Joe Biden's administration, testified that Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, needs dozens of additional prosecutors to cover a county of 1.2 million people. And a crime statistician said that rates of murder and violent crime are falling nationwide and in Charlotte after increases early in the 2020s.",
      "Republicans, in turn, blasted Democratic members, saying additional funding wouldn't have prevented the deaths of Zarutska or the other homicide victims highlighted Monday. And they attempted to question the crime figures as misleading.",

Ralph Norman of South Carolina, representing in part Charlotte's suburbs. He spoke while holding a poster of a screenshot of the video showing Zarutska and her attacker. Adams protested Norman's use of the placard.",
      "In response to Zarutska's death, the Republican-controlled North Carolina legislature last week approved a criminal justice package that would bar cashless bail in many circumstances, limit the discretion magistrates and judges have in making pretrial release decisions and seek to ensure more defendants undergo mental health evaluations. The bill now sits on Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's desk for his consideration.",

      "Federal spending reductions on Medicaid and food benefits also could cause states to spend more of their own money on social safety net programs. But new Medicaid work requirements, which are among the most prominent changes, don't begin until 2027. Administrative cost shifts to states for food stamps begin in October 2026, with additional performance-based cost shifts in subsequent years.",

      "Legislation recently signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom provides $255 million for California's response to Trump's big bill and other federal policy changes. That includes $84 million to try to reduce errors in benefit payments in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Those food benefits currently are fully covered by the federal government, but states with error rates greater than 6% could have to pay part of the cost starting in October 2027.",
      "Trump's big bill also expands work requirements for adults participating SNAP, which is expected to force some people off the program in the coming months. The California legislation provides $40 million for counties to implement the new SNAP requirements and pumps $20 million into emergency food banks, a one-third increase over previously approved state funding.",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

But it was never designed to be a suicide prevention app, Stephan said, and police would not be called if someone told the bot about thoughts of self-harm.",
      "Stephan said she's happy that people are looking at AI with a critical eye, but worried about states' ability to keep up with innovation.",
      "\"The speed at which everything is evolving is massive,\u201d she said.",
      "Other apps blocked access immediately. When Illinois users download the AI therapy app Ash, a message urges them to email their legislators, arguing \u201cmisguided legislation\u201d has banned apps like Ash \"while leaving unregulated chatbots it intended to regulate free to cause harm.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Ash did not respond to multiple requests for an interview.",
      "Mario Treto Jr., secretary of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, said the goal was ultimately to make sure licensed therapists were the only ones doing therapy.",
      "\u201cTherapy is more than just word exchanges,\u201d Treto said. \"It requires empathy, it requires clinical judgment, it requires ethical responsibility, none of which AI can truly replicate right now.\u201d",
      "In March, a Dartmouth University-based team published the first known randomized clinical trial of a generative AI chatbot for mental health treatment.",
      "The goal was to have the chatbot, called Therabot, treat people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or eating disorders. It was trained on vignettes and transcripts written by the team to illustrate an evidence-based response.",
      "The study found users rated Therabot similar to a therapist and had meaningfully lower symptoms after eight weeks compared with people who didn't use it. Every interaction was monitored by a human who intervened if the chatbot\u2019s response was harmful or not evidence-based.",
      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",
      "\u201cThe space is so dramatically new that I think the field needs to proceed with much greater caution that is happening right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples\u2019 thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not.",
      "Therabot\u2019s team sought to avoid those issues.",
      "The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective.",
      "\u201cThey want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.\u201d",
      "Regulators and advocates of the laws say they are open to changes. But today's chatbots are not a solution to the mental health provider shortage, said Kyle Hillman, who lobbied for the bills in Illinois and Nevada through his affiliation with the National Association of Social Workers.",
      "\u201cNot everybody who's feeling sad needs a therapist,\u201d he said. But for people with real mental health issues or suicidal thoughts, \"telling them, \u2018I know that there\u2019s a workforce shortage but here's a bot' \u2014 that is such a privileged position.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Majority Leader John Thune are digging in ahead of this week's deadline to keep the government open, showing little evidence of budging even as both sides have agreed to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday.",
      "Republicans say Democrats need to help them pass a simple extension of government funding by Tuesday night to avoid a shutdown and they will not agree to negotiate until after it's approved. Democrats say they want immediate talks on health care, and they are willing to shut down the government if they don't get concessions.",
      "A shutdown is \u201ctotally up to the Democrats,\u201d Thune, R-S.D., said in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\"",
      "\u201cThe ball is in their court.\u201d Thune said. \u201cThere is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now, we could pick it up today and pass it, that has been passed by the House that will be signed into law by the president to keep the government open.\u201d",
      "Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the same program that \u201cit's up to them\" whether Republicans will negotiate when the two sides meet at the White House on Monday.",
      "\u201cGod forbid the Republicans shut the government down,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThe American people will know it\u2019s on their back.\u201d",
      "The Senate standoff is just the latest in annual disagreements over funding, but hopes are dimming for a quick resolution. Democrats have suggested they are more willing than ever to allow a shutdown as they face demands from their base voters to fight harder against Trump and the Republican-led Congress. Some even argue that a shutdown might not make much difference because Trump has slashed so many government jobs already.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hearing from the American people that they need help on health care,\u201d Schumer said. \"And as for these massive layoffs, guess what? Simple, one-sentence answer: they\u2019re doing it anyway.\"",
      "The Senate is expected to vote on the House-passed bill to extend government funding on Tuesday, ahead of the 12:01 a.m. Wednesday deadline to avert a shutdown. The bill would keep the government open for another seven weeks while Congress finishes its annual spending bills.",
      "Republicans will likely need at least eight Democrats to approve a short-term fix, as Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is expected to vote against it. Majority Republicans hold 53 seats and they need 60 votes to end a filibuster and pass the legislation.",
      "Schumer said Democrats need \u201ca serious negotiation\u201d at the White House meeting with Trump and the four top congressional leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.",

Thune said Sunday that the program is \u201cdesperately in need of reform\u201d and \u201cis fraught with waste, fraud, and abuse. There are so many people who don\u2019t even know they have coverage, because the payments are made directly to the insurance company.\u201d",
      "The White House has raised the possibility of mass firings across the federal government if there is a shutdown. Trump's White House told agencies to prepare large-scale layoffs of federal workers if the government shuts down.",

      "Maine has one of New England\u2019s highest food insecurity rates",
      "WINTERPORT, Maine -- Phylis Allen spends her days looking for things. She searches for potatoes at Sam\u2019s Club, cheap beets and ginger at Walmart and a local grocery store. She studies the weekly inventory from Good Shepherd, Maine\u2019s only food bank, for good deals on butter and cheese.",
      "Every Monday morning, she shops at three different stores, keeping lists of prices in her head and remembering what particular clients want. On a recent trip to Sam\u2019s Club, she was searching for affordable eggs.",
      "The diminutive 78-year-old food pantry director found them in a huge cooler. Stretching, she pulled two huge boxes off the top shelf \u2014 seven dozen eggs each, $21 a box. \u201c$2.82 a dozen,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good price for eggs.\u201d",
      "The eggs were destined for Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard, the food pantry in Winterport, Maine, that Allen has helped run for the past 17 years. Every Wednesday, she and a tightknit group of volunteers provide 25 to 30 families with heaping bags of food.",
      "Maine has long been one of the most food insecure states in New England. Directors of food pantries say the task of making sure people are fed is getting harder because of diminishing food supplies, increasing demand and an overwhelming reliance on volunteers, many of whom are retirees with ages up into their 80s.",
      "About one in seven people in rural Waldo County, where Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard is, were food insecure in 2023, a rate that was similar to the state and national average, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying on Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration cut more than $1 billion from two U.S. Department of Agriculture programs \u2014 the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides free food to food banks nationwide, and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provides funds to state, territorial and tribal governments to purchase food from local farmers for distribution to hunger relief organizations.",
      "\u201cI can watch the availability of federal food going down every month,\u201d Allen said.",
      "Charitable food networks are also bracing for $186 billion in cuts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the federal low-income nutrition program better known as food stamps. In turn, Feeding America predicts that food pantries will see more demand.",
      "Complicating matters is the infrastructure through which the U.S. distributes most food to those who need help. In Maine, the nearly 600 hunger relief agencies that get free and low-cost food from Good Shepherd Food Bank rely on volunteers. This includes 250 food pantries as well as soup kitchens, senior centers, shelters, schools and youth programs.",
      "More than 75% of these organizations rely completely on volunteers, with no paid staff, according to Good Shepherd.",
      "Anna Korsen, who co-chairs the Ending Hunger in Maine advisory committee, said food pantries alone aren\u2019t the answer to food insecurity.",
      "\u201cIf our goal is to end hunger in Maine, which is a lofty goal, then we\u2019re not going to do that through a charitable food network that\u2019s run by volunteers, right?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be for crisis situations \u2026 but what has happened is that it is just a part of the food system now. It shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d",
      "Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard hummed with activity on a recent Wednesday morning, cans stacked in piles six feet high and children\u2019s collages taped to a cooler.",
      "Keith Ritchie was greeting clients \u2014 and keeping a gentle eye out to make sure no one took more than their fair share of limited foods. At 89, he is the pantry\u2019s oldest worker, although Betty Williams, 88, teases him about who\u2019s older.",
      "In more than 17 years of service, Ritchie said, \u201cI\u2019ve only missed twice.\u201d He drives 20 miles (32 kilometers) each way to dole out groceries and fill bags with \u201csurprises\u201d \u2013 donated items like Girl Scout cookies.",

      "It\u2019s not a lack of desire to serve, but obstacles in the way, said researcher Quixada Moore-Vissing, an author of the report.",
      "\u201cI would categorize it as being an overwhelmed and overworked society,\u201d Moore-Vissing said. \u201cThe rising costs of everything, and in particular the cost of housing, means that people have to work more.\"",

Make a volumetric drawing of a person, a portrait, or an acrobat, or an animal, or some scene, and creating something that was experienced by people in a very different way than you would a solid mass.\"",
      "Just like the garden's namesake, the space embraces the unconventional.",
      "\"I'm trying to work with my grandfather's own idea, where he doesn't predispose you to a certain outcome,\" Rower said. \"He'd like to create a forum where there's an object in space, and you enter that space. The space is part of the work of art. For some people these kind of subtle things can happen, and you can have an experience. Hopefully it's an uplifting one.\"",

    "summary": "Part of the 1960s British pop invasion that began with The Beatles, The Zombies took a lot longer for success to catch up with them. Now their most famous album, 1968's \"Odessey and Oracle,\" has been remastered.",
    "story": [
      "Remember when radio DJs used to say a hit song was \"number one with a bullet\"?\u00a0 Well, this one was the slowest bullet in rock history. \"Time of the Season,\" by The Zombies, released in March 1968, reached #3 on the Billboard charts a full year later.",
      "Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone are in their 80s now. In their teens they were members of The Zombies, part of the 1960s British pop invasion that began with The Beatles, except that, for The Zombies, success took a lot longer to catch up with them.",
      "Of the five original Zombies, four survive: Argent, Blunstone, Hugh Grundy and Chris White. The fifth member, Paul Atkinson, died in 2004.",
      "\"We were friends, really, right from the very start,\" said Agent.",
      "\"It just clicked, yeah, it really did,\" said Grundy.",
      "White added, \"And we're still friends!\"",
      "They first got the band together at a youth club in their hometown just north of London, where a local artist has now finally put up a mural of them.",
      "But boy, was it a bumpy road to rock 'n' roll immortality.",
      "The first song Argent wrote was \"She's Not There,\" about unrequited adolescent love (is there another kind?). It was the making of them.",
      "\"She's Not There\" made it onto \"Juke Box Jury,\" a British is-it-a-hit-or-a-miss TV show, where one of the panelists loved it: \"I think it's a hit,\" he said. That panelist was George Harrison of The Beatles. It didn't hurt.",
      "The song went to #1 on the Cash Box chart, and #2 in Billboard.",
      "\"It was on the 9 o'clock news,\" said Argent. \"They said The Zombies had become the first group after The Beatles to have a number one record with a self-written composition\" - the song Argent wrote - \"Yeah, I'm in heaven!.\"",
      "\"She's Not There\" wasn't just a hit; it was their ticket to ride. They went to America, and hit the road with the Dick Clark Caravan of Stars. \"This was a dream come true for us,\" said Blunstone.",
      "Grundy said, \"We were terrified because here we were taking a lot of their influence, and there we were on stage with these fabulous artists going, 'Can we do this, can we even play with them?'\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel you were being imposters bringing American-style rhythm and blues music back to America?\"",
      "\"With English accents!\" said White.",
      "\"We thought exactly that,\" Argent replied. \"But they saw us as doing something really quite different. But we realize now that we did really have something quite original. We really did have our own stamp.\"",
      "But there was a problem: Money. There wasn't any.",
      "Blunstone said, \"We were 19 years old, we were very na\u00efve, and we didn't realize what our options were. So, I'm afraid that touring revenue was poor. Sometimes non-existent!\"",
      "Not only that, they felt their music had stagnated and suffered. They decided to produce their own album, in their own way. They went to the mothership of British rock, the famous Abbey Road Studios in London.",
      "Returning there, Blunstone said, \"You do get this really emotional feeling walking into it. Because, I mean, there's so much history in these walls.\"",
      "The session produced what became their signature album, \"Odessey and Oracle,\" now considered one of rock 'n' roll's greats. But not then. Then, it sank without a trace. \"There was no real interest in us,\" Argent said.",
      "Blunstone said, \"I thought we had a chance, but it became fairly clear fairly quickly that the industry pretty much ignored it, really.\"",
      "The Zombies thought it was all over and broke up. Blunstone took a job in insurance. Grundy sold cars. White and Argent wrote songs for other people, including this one for Argent's new band: \"Hold Your Head Up.\"",
      "But \"Odessey and Oracle\" wouldn't die. More than a year later, one of the tracks, \"Time of the Season,\" started to get some play.",
      "\"Famously there was one DJ in Boise, Idaho who kept playing 'Time of the Season,'\" said Blunstone. \"It spread to other radio stations. It took months for it to be a hit, but again, it went to number one in Cash Box.\"",
      "Finally, more than 50 years after their hits, The Zombies made it into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; and now, a remastered version of \"Odessey and Oracle\" has been released.",
      "\"Now,\" said Blunstone, \"it gets name-checked as a major influence in so many people's careers.\"",
      "\"Considered a Top 50 rock album, iconic rock album,\" I added.",
      "\"I know! And here we are. Is it nearly 70 years later? It's a very strange story.\"",
      "But a story with a happy ending. For The Zombies, their season has finally come.",

    "story": [
      "The first thing you notice about Jennifer Lopez' perch over West Hollywood is the Old Hollywood part of it. Images of Barbra Streisand, Bette Davis and the Rat Pack all bedazzle the walls.",
      "\"I love making movies,\" she said, pointing to one photo. \"And I feel like this is me a little bit. But it's not me, it's Sophia Loren! And with the crew there, and this is what my life is: it's me by a camera doing this every day!\"",
      "Lopez is a movie mainstay. She's made at least one film almost every year for the past three decades. Some were memorable, others weren't. Golden Globes and Oscars both eluded her. But this year just might be different, due to \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" an old-fashioned musical. \"I just thought to myself, This is what I've been waiting for my whole life,\" she said. \"I grew up on musicals. My mom loved musicals, and so I saw every musical you can think of. She was a fanatic!\"",
      "I asked, \"How many times do you think you saw 'West Side Story'?\"",
      "\"So many,\" she sighed. \"And it wasn't, 'Oh I've seen it about five times.' No! I've seen it hundreds of times! I feel like, so much!\"",
      "No surprise one of her idols is Rita Moreno, the other the late Chita Rivera, who starred in \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" on Broadway \u2013 the same Tony-winning shoes that Lopez is now trying to fill.",
      "Does she feel the weight of that? \"I kind of let it go and understood that I had to make it my own,\" she said.",
      "It came, though, at a tough time in her personal life \u2013 Ben Affleck, her now ex-husband, is one of the film's executive producers. \"It was a really tough time,\" she said. \"Every moment on set, every moment I was doing this role, I was so happy. And then, it was like, back home it was not great. And it was just like, Oh, you know, how do I reconcile this?\"",
      "Their divorce was settled the same month that \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" premiered at Sundance. \"It was the best thing that ever happened to me,\" she said. \"Because it changed me \u2026 It didn't change me, it helped me grow in a way that I needed to grow.\"",
      "The bright music of \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" is a purposeful contrast to the film's darker tale. It's an escape for two cellmates in an Argentinian prison: Molina, a queer window dresser; and Valentin, a proud Marxist revolutionary. Going to a movie in their mind helped ease their drudgery, and dissolve their differences.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" click on the video player below:",
      "Lopez said, \"It is a love letter, in a way, to the Latin community and to the queer community, this movie, because in a time like this \u2026 those communities are being demonized and marginalized.\"",
      "Inclusion and acceptance have always been themes in her music. Performing at the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show in Miami, one of her twins, Emme (whom she had with her third husband Marc Anthony), sang with her proudly about the challenges of identity \u2013 cultural and otherwise. \"Singing that with my child there, and them screaming that back to me \u2013 'cause I'm gonna live my life \u2013 that was one of the best moments in my life,\" said Lopez, who then apologized for getting emotional thinking back on that. \"I didn't know it would catch me like that. It was one of the best moments of my life. Being so joyful and happy and being exactly who they were.\"",
      "The kind of global platform that she has now was unimaginable back when, against her parents' wishes, she dropped out of college and ran from her home in the Bronx chasing the city lights of Manhattan.",
      "With no place to stay, she slept on a bench at the Phil Black Dance Studio on Broadway. \"I crashed there for a while,\" she said. \"You know, when you're young you can do stuff like that. You don't know what's gonna happen to you.\"",
      "\"It's not an inconvenience,\" I said.",
      "\"No! You're like, whatever. Great! I can sleep here. I'll sleep here!\"",
      "As a kid, seeing a live Broadway show was a rare privilege, but the experience stuck. \"I remember sitting in an audience, watching a live show one time,\" she said. \"And I was with a friend, and I said, 'When you see that, don't you want to be up there, doing that?' And they were like, 'No!' And I was like, 'Okay. Is it just me?'\"",
      "In-between her auditions, Lopez was selling programs for \"Phantom of the Opera\" out in front of the Majestic Theatre. \"I was, like, really using my best tactics,\" she said. \"Like, I swing it up in the air and, like, you know, kind of try to be charming and funny!\"",
      "It was a winding road that finally got Jennifer Lopez to her own musical. It might just be that going back in time to Old Hollywood \u00a0-- is what pushes her Hollywood career forward.",
      "\"The hard times are the lessons, and you have to understand that,\" she said. \"You have to understand that. And once you do, everything just becomes a little bit lighter. And you can really, really fly.\"",
      "\"Does it feel like you're flying now?\" I asked.",

    "summary": "President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between Tylenol and autism has drawn pushback from medical experts.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout\" Thursday the Trump administration is not advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol under any circumstances \u2014 as President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between the painkiller and fever reducer and autism draws pushback from medical experts.",
      "Oz \u2014 a former surgeon and television personality who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency that is under the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 said that if a pregnant woman develops a high fever, a doctor will likely encourage her to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, because fevers can pose health risks. And\u00a0studies show acetaminophen is the safest medication to treat fevers in pregnant women.",
      "\"The concern here is that I believe most women get low-grade fevers, they stub their toe, they have little aches and pains, and they think it's perfectly safe to throw a couple paracetamol or acetaminophen or Tylenol when they're pregnant, and I don't think that's the case,\" Oz said.",
      "On Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary released an open letter to physicians that said acetaminophen use during pregnancy \"may be associated with\" an increased risk of conditions like autism.",
      "The letter noted that \"while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established.\"",
      "Makary's letter was also more tempered than Mr. Trump's comments during a news conference earlier this week in which the president said there's \"no downside in not taking\" Tylenol.",
      "\"Acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics,\" Makary wrote in his letter.",
      "There is concern among the medical community that, as a result of the FDA's announcement Monday, that some patients could turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News following the FDA's announcement. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "In a statement in response to the FDA's announcement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "Oz also addressed Makary's announcement that the agency will approve the prescription drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, to treat autism in children. Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"The key question is, if you, as a researcher on those trials, had a child, would you give that child leucovorin?\" Oz said he asked of researchers studying leucovorin. \"And when I asked the doctors on those trials, they said yes.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years,\u00a0according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no scientific consensus as to why.",
      "Oz said that when he, Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, were asked by the White House to examine the issue, they found two \"clues,\" not conclusions, that pointed to leucovorin as a possible treatment option for autistic children, and acetaminophen as a medication pregnant women should be cautious about taking.",
      "\"These are things that we believe, that if you're fully transparent about, you'll rebuild trust with the American people,\" Oz said. \"Just tell people what you know.\"",
      "Oz argued that Mr. Trump was right in pushing for the FDA to both approve leucovorin and make its Tylenol recommendation \u2014 even though there is no consensus in the medical community and no definitive evidence supporting either move \u2014 because he believes the FDA has an obligation to be transparent.",
      "But Oz was clear that patients should consult their doctors first before making a decision.",
      "\"The Tylenol issue is whether or not we should warn moms, who are pregnant today, about a problem that we may not know fully the answer to \u2014 'Is Tylenol a problem during pregnancy?' \u2014 for another five years,\" Oz said. \"Well, what about the kid today? Are you going to take the Tylenol or not. Well I think the answer is, the best prudent answer, of course take it if a doctor says you need it.

      "The U.S. Department of Labor said it would delay releases of economic data if the federal government shuts down\u00a0this week, which could postpone Friday's highly anticipated monthly jobs report.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department posted a 73-page \"contingency plan\" detailing operations if government funding lapses at midnight on Sept. 30. If that occurs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) would suspend all operations, including data collection activities for BLS surveys, website updates and economic reports, the plan states.",
      "The BLS is scheduled to release its report on September employment gains on Oct. 3. In a shutdown, government agencies must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded from other sources, such as fees, or under other legislation.",
      "The BLS' closely watched monthly jobs report drew scrutiny last month when President Trump\u00a0fired its commissioner of labor statistics after disappointing employment numbers. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled it is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness amid a hiring slowdown.",
      "Awkward timing",
      "Earlier this month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited headwinds facing the labor market as a key factor in the central bank's vote for an\u00a0interest rate cut\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "\"The timing of the looming potential government shutdown is not ideal for the Fed, which is set to meet again on October 29th,\" said Mike Reid, senior U.S. economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, in a research report.",
      "Although it's unclear whether a shutdown will occur or how long it could last, the possibility raises the risk that some government economic reports would not be available to the Fed before its next meeting on Oct. 29, he added.",
      "\"In our view, an increasingly data dependent Federal Reserve with limited visibility into the September data increases the probability of an October pause,\" meaning that the Fed could hold off on an additional rate cut at the Oct. 29 meeting, Reid\u00a0wrote.",
      "Earlier this month, the BLS reported that\u00a0employers added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' forecasts. The September report, scheduled for Friday, is expected to show about 50,500 new hires, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "\"We believe that a shutdown will have only a small and transitory economic impact, but it may spur some financial market volatility, especially if delays in government economic reports obscure the path of Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts,\" said Jennifer Timmerman, investment strategy analyst, in a Wells Fargo Investment Institute\u00a0report\u00a0released Monday.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government could shut down on Wednesday if Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even if a U.S.\u00a0government shutdown begins on Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress, with lawmakers currently at loggerheads over funding the federal government past Sept. 30.",
      "If an agreement isn't reached before then, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for their operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan published by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

    "summary": "While the tariffs will impact everyone to some degree, experts say more of the pain will be felt by lower-income consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Fresh tariffs on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities recently announced by President Trump on social media\u00a0could cause already high prices to rise even further, and deter some Americans from embarking on home renovation projects.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday said his administration will levy a 50% tariff on all imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and \"associated products,\" plus a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture from abroad.",
      "Preventing what he called the \"flooding\" of such goods into the U.S. is a matter of national security, the president added. Both sets of tariffs will kick in Oct. 1, he said. \"It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture \u2014 much of which is imported \u2014 rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025,\u00a0the latest CPI data shows, driven by Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs, according to economists.\u00a0Furniture and bedding also rose 4.7% over the same period, and 2.8% for household furnishings and supplies.",
      "If the new levies go into effect, furniture makers will feel the hit, and some will likely pass the costs on to consumers, industry analysts told CBS News. The sectoral tariffs could also hinder business activity and growth, they added, as companies wait to see if tariff policies change and defer investment decisions.",
      "\"Higher prices are an inevitable consequence of these tariffs,\" Zak Stambor, a retail analyst at market research company eMarketer, told CBS News. \"People undergoing bathroom or kitchen renovations are in a tough spot right now because there was so little warning. The costs of those things will now be higher, and people might not have already bought them because they were waiting for permits.\"",
      "Low-income consumers will feel the squeeze the most, not just because they have less discretionary income but because lower-cost furniture sold in the U.S. tends to be imported from Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia and India.",
      "Some higher-end furniture is manufactured in the U.S., and therefore less exposed to tariffs, according to Telsey Advisory Group managing director and senior retail analyst Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. She said retailers will have no choice but to raise prices on imported goods once the tariffs take effect.",
      "\"They are trying not to raise prices too much ahead of holiday season. But they can't absorb 30% tariffs on top of other tariffs that are already in place,\" she told CBS News. \"They'll have to pass through pricing, probably in the form of a double-digit price increase.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News's request for comment on analysts' claims the tariffs could drive up prices or inhibit business investment.",
      "Uncertainty persists",
      "From retailers' point of view, the levies could make investing in new inventory a riskier and more difficult proposition, according to Stambor, as costs and consumer demand could shift.",
      "\"Retailers' only certainty is that uncertainty is here to stay. What's true today very well may not be true tomorrow and that makes life incredibly challenging,\" he said.",
      "Naturepedic, an Ohio-based maker of organic mattresses and bedroom furniture, said it had been planning to launch an upholstered product line in late 2025 or early 2026, including headboards. However, as of Thursday, it is reconsidering that expansion.",
      "\"We are having to go back to the drawing board a little bit,\" Naturepedic Chief Growth Officer Arin Schultz told CBS News. \"We might drop it if it doesn't make sense, even though we're pretty far along in the process.\"",
      "Of the tariffs announced on Thursday, he said, \"If they could turn around and not do it, that would be great.\"",
      "Cost to consumers",
      "John Mercer, head of global research at Coresight Research, a provider of retail industry insights, doesn't expect all manufacturers to pass on all tariff-related costs to the consumer, and says some will likely take steps to mitigate the impact.",
      "Firms with larger inventories will be able to sell through what they have in stock before implementing any price hikes, while on-demand furniture makers may have to raise prices sooner, rather than later, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing.",
      "Mercer, however, doesn't expect the levies to compel makers of upholstered furniture and cabinetry to quickly move production to the U.S.",
      "\"Generally, that's not easy, and it's more expensive,\" he said. \"There is a reason why companies have offshored production, and that's because because it's traditionally much cheaper.\"",

      "The contamination problem was discovered after Hillshire received multiple consumer complaints, the service notes, five of which involved injuries. The company later determined that a \"limited number\" of these products included \"extraneous pieces of wooden stick within the batter,\" Tyson said in a corresponding announcement, adding that it opted to initiate a recall \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "The recalled corn dogs and sausage-on-a-stick goods were produced between March 17 and as recently as Friday, per Saturday's recall notices. Tyson, which is headquartered in Arkansas, said the issue was isolated to one facility located in Haltom City, Texas.",
      "FSIS is worried that some of these recalled products may be in consumers' refrigerators and freezers in households across the U.S., as well as some schools and other institutions. In addition to being sold online and to retailers nationwide, the agency noted Saturday, these products were also sold to school districts and Defense Department facilities.",
      "Consumers in possession of the recalled items are urged to throw them away or return them to their place of purchase.",
      "To determine which corn dogs and other sausage goods are subject to this recall, consumers should check the product's name, use-by dates and other identifying information published online by the FSIS and Tyson. The products being recalled should also have an establishment number of \"EST-582\" or \"P-894\" printed on the packaging.",
      "It's unclear if consumers who purchased these now-recalled products will be eligible for a refund. The FSIS says consumers with questions about the recall can contact Christina Self, The Hillshire Brands Company Associate Director of Customer Care, at 888-747-7611.",
      "Foreign object contamination is one of the top reasons for food recalls in the U.S. Beyond plastic, metal fragments, bits of bugs and more \"extraneous\" materials have prompted recalls by making their way into packaged goods.",

      "Forbes, which has produced a list of billionaires since the 1980s, counted roughly 900 in early 2025 \u2014 up from 813 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the wealth-data firm Altrata pinned the number of U.S. billionaires at 1,135 in 2024, an uptick from 1,050 in 2023 and up more than 80% from levels in 2016, when they began releasing yearly reports.",
      "And JP Morgan Chase Private Bank estimated the number at roughly 1,990 in 2024 \u2014 about 15% more than its 2023 estimate.",
      "Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates.",
      "Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set.",
      "His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and\u00a0Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29.",
      "Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, \"The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people.\"",
      "Billionaires have roughly $6.8 trillion in wealth in 2025",
      "Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024.",
      "In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth \"could be turned into cash and distributed equally\u2014which it couldn't\u2014[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each.\"",
      "Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person.",
      "Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt\u00a0and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over.",
      "The ultra rich own an increasingly large share of the nation's wealth",
      "Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades \u2014 toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age.",
      "The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data.",
      "\"What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses,\" said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas.",
      "But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri.",
      "By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth \u2014 up over 10 percentage points from 1980.",
      "Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country \u2014 or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023.",
      "The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023.",
      "Most billionaires are males with self-made fortunes, but a significant number inherited their money",
      "Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways.",
      "The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men \u2014 about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes \u2014 and most make rather than inherit their wealth.",
      "Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of \"A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.\"",
      "\"He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks,\" Nichols said. \"But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time.\"",
      "Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data.",
      "Some of America's wealthiest heirs include Walmart's Alice, Rob and Jim Walton, and Jacqueline Mars, who owns roughly one third of the candy giant Mars founded by her grandfather.",
      "Rockefeller and his son gave away a significant amount of their money to charity but it continues to live on. And descendants of the family share a fortune valued around $10.3 billion in 2024.",

    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin on Wednesday, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap. Federal agencies develop plans ahead of a shutdown to determine which employees will remain working.",
      "For instance, the Department of Health and Human Services posted its shutdown plan on Sept. 25, which states that more than 32,000 employees, or about 41% of the agency's workforce, will be furloughed. The other employees are either funded through sources other than annual appropriations or will continue to work, although without pay, because they are in essential roles.",
      "And while federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "Government shutdowns have typically been short, with the pay of military service persons often seen as a deadline for getting funding restored, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report. The next military pay date at risk from a shutdown would be Oct. 15, they noted.",
      "\"For civilian employees, the first pay date at risk would be Oct. 10 but this is less likely to drive a compromise,\" the analysts noted.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a self-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

    "summary": "Under a new law, many Americans will have to meet a work requirement to obtain and keep their Medicaid coverage. But due to an exemption, millions living in areas of high unemployment could be spared.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Medicaid enrollees may have a way out of the new federal work requirement \u2014 if they live in a county with high unemployment.",
      "By January 2027, President Trump's far-reaching domestic policy law will require many adult, nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 42 states and Washington, D.C., to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or go to school.",
      "But under the law, Medicaid enrollees in counties where unemployment is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate could be shielded from the work requirement, if their state applies for an exemption.",
      "A new analysis by KFF shows that exemption in the GOP's work requirement could offer a reprieve to potentially millions of Americans caught in a tough spot \u2014 needing to work to secure health insurance but having trouble finding a job.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office projected the work requirement would apply to 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees, causing about 5.3 million to lose their government health coverage by 2034. CBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma confirmed to KFF Health News that analysts factored the unemployment rate exemption into their projections. Only states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act or a special waiver must enact a work requirement, under the federal law.",
      "But how many people could be exempt depends on how the Trump administration interprets the law, in addition to whether their states' officials apply.",
      "For example, if Trump officials exempt people in counties where the unemployment rate has been above the law's thresholds for any month over a 12-month period, about 4.6 million Medicaid enrollees in 386 counties could qualify for an exemption today based on the latest unemployment data, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That amounts to just under a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees subject to the work requirement.",
      "Under that one-month threshold, \"the impact could be fairly significant,\" said Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the analysis and the deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.",
      "But, she said, the Trump administration is more likely to adopt a stricter threshold based on average unemployment over a 12-month period. That would align with work requirements under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food assistance commonly known as food stamps.",
      "Only about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees living in 158 counties could be exempted under that standard, or about 7% of the total subject to work requirements, KFF found. That's about 7% of enrollees who live in expansion states who would otherwise need to meet the new requirement.",
      "Based on the 12-month criteria, about 90% of Medicaid enrollees who could be exempted based on high unemployment reside in five states, according to KFF: California, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. California alone accounts for over half of those who could be exempted.",
      "The unemployment rate exemption is one of several carve-outs from the Medicaid work requirement in the GOP's law. The law also exempts parents with children under 14, people who are disabled or frail, and those who are pregnant, incarcerated, or in a substance use disorder program, among others. The high unemployment provision is different than most because it exempts people living in entire counties.",
      "Two top Republicans key to the bill's passage \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "To qualify for the Medicaid exemption, states would have to apply to the federal government on behalf of individuals in eligible counties. And if a county earned an exemption, the government would determine how long it applies.",
      "Even if the federal government grants exemptions broadly, health advocates fear some Republican-led states could balk at applying for exemptions in order to keep enrollment down, as they say has been the case with SNAP exemptions. As of 2023, 18 states did not have an exemption under the SNAP program, even though some of their residents might be eligible.",
      "\"It's not a guarantee that people can rely on,\" said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group that intends to push for the broadest possible exemptions to help people maintain their coverage. Eastern Kentucky has several counties with perennially high unemployment.",
      "In advocating for Mr. Trump's bill, many Republicans in Washington argued that most people who gained Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act should be working to get off of government assistance.",
      "But as Georgia's and Arkansas' experiences have shown, Medicaid work requirements can be costly for states to run and frustrating for enrollees to navigate. About 18,000 people in Arkansas, or nearly a quarter of the state's adults who gained Medicaid coverage through the ACA expansion, lost coverage when the state had a work requirement in 2018 and 2019. A court ended the state's work requirement program.",
      "Critics point out that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a disability or caregiving responsibilities, and they argue the reporting requirements merely serve as a bureaucratic hurdle to obtaining and keeping coverage. Under the GOP law, enrollees' work status needs to be verified at least twice a year.",
      "Most of the coverage losses due to work requirements occur among people who work or should qualify for an exemption but nevertheless lose coverage due to red tape, research shows.",
      "Not every state must implement a work requirement under Mr. Trump's law, only those that chose to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people through the ACA or a federal waiver. The ACA has provided hundreds of billions in federal dollars to help states cover everyone making up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 $21,597 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Forty states and Washington, D.C., took up the expansion. Georgia and Wisconsin partly expanded their Medicaid eligibility by getting a federal waiver, adding them to the list of states subject to the work requirement. These two states were not included in the KFF analysis because of a lack of county-level enrollment data.",
      "Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said she is pleased the law makes some exceptions for places where jobs are scarce. It could limit how many people lose coverage because of the work requirement, she said.",
      "Wagner said SNAP's unemployment rate exemption has helped millions of people avoid losing their food assistance, but its impact also depends on whether a state seeks the waiver.",
      "She is concerned the Trump administration may make it difficult for counties to get exempted under the Medicaid law.",
      "\"I'm glad it's in there as it will certainly help people, but it's still a terrible bill,\" she said. \"This will not really blunt the harm of the bill.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is warning consumers not to eat certain ready-to-eat pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's stores because they may be contaminated with listeria bacteria previously linked to a deadly outbreak tied to pre-made chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals.",
      "In an announcement Thursday, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a public health alert for Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce sold at Walmart in refrigerated 12-ounce clear plastic trays. The products have best-by dates of Sept. 22 through Oct. 1 and may still be in consumers' refrigerators.",
      "In an update on Friday, the FSIS added to its public health alert some meals sold at Trader Joe's, the Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo, sold in 16-ounce plastic tray packages with \"best if used by\" dates of Sept. 20, Sept. 24 or Sept. 27. The products contain the establishment number \"P- 45288\" inside the USDA mark of inspection. The stores possibly affected are in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, Trader Joe's said Friday.",
      "The affected meals from Walmart contain the establishment numbers \"EST. 50784\" and \"EST. 47718\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the label. They were sent to Walmart stores nationwide.",
      "\"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have removed this product from our impacted stores and we are working with the supplier to investigate,\" a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News on Friday.",
      "There have been no reported illness complaints for the product in question and consumers should discard the meals if they have them and can receive a full refund at any Walmart store. Trader Joe's told customers to discard the product or return it to their local store for a full refund.",
      "\"We are issuing this guidance in an abundance of caution because testing of another brand with a shared ingredient source indicated this product may have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,\" Trader Joe's said on its website. \"There have been no positive Listeria tests for the Trader Joe's product itself, and there have been no reports of illness associated with these production codes.\"",
      "No recall has been issued, but FreshRealm, a large food producer that distributed the products, said they advised Walmart this week to pull the meals from store shelves. Additional products may be identified, according to the FSIS.",
      "The meals may be contaminated with the same strain of listeria that caused an outbreak tied to chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Walmart and Kroger stores.\u00a0Four people were killed and at least 20 were sickened in the outbreak, which federal health officials updated on Friday evening. The outbreak led to a large recall this summer.",
      "\"FreshRealm held beef meatball marinara linguine meals after they tested positive for the outbreak strain,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0said in its update Friday. \"Pasta that went into the beef meatball marinara linguine meals has tested positive for Listeria, but additional information is pending to determine if the samples taken from the pre-cooked pasta is the same strain making people sick. Do not eat affected foods, return them or throw them out.\"",
      "FreshRealm conducted tests that detected the listeria in linguine used in the meatball dish, company officials said. The strain matched the listeria identified in the chicken fettuccine Alfredo outbreak, the company said.",
      "\"We have long maintained that the source of the listeria was likely an ingredient supplied by a third party,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The pasta came from Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California. The company did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.",
      "Listeria infections can cause serious illness, particularly in older adults, people with weakened immune systems, and those who are pregnant or their newborns. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, tiredness, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, according to the CDC.",
      "About 1,600 people get sick each year from listeria infections and about 260 die, the CDC says. Federal officials in December said they were revamping protocols to prevent listeria infections after several high-profile outbreaks, including one linked to Boar's Head deli meats that led to 10 deaths and more than 60 illnesses last year.",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 20:29:37 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture and a 25% tariff on heavy trucks.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks.",
      "In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either \"breaking ground\" or being \"under construction.\"",
      "In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.",
      "Still, some experts think the new pharma tariffs could end up having only a modest impact, noting that generic drugs are exempt. The loophole for drugmakers with operations in the U.S. is also likely to soften the blow, Neal Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the U.S. or have announced plans to build production in the near future,\" he said. \"Add in the fact that pharmaceuticals is the one area where we think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year, as importers have sought to front-run potential tariffs, and the impact on the effective tariff rate is likely to be small.\"",
      "Higher costs for home furnishings?",
      "Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were \"flooding\" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied \"for National Security and other reasons.\"",
      "The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a \"major Tariff Investigation\" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced.",
      "The president said the 25% tariff on \"all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world\" was \"in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition.\"",
      "\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted.",
      "Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after economic data this month showed the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.",
      "Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.",
      "\"There's no inflation,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We're having unbelievable success.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for\u00a0a deal\u00a0brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "\"With this executive order, you will be effectively bringing into effect the agreement that will save TikTok and ensure that it can operate safely and securely,\" White House staff secretary Will Scharf said ahead of a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.",
      "The move declares that the deal represents a \"qualified divestiture\" that satisfies a law passed by Congress requiring TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban and pushes back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during their call last week. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The TikTok deal",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16. The new order extends the pause until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, according to the White House. The executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by the divest-or-ban law.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said at the White House that the new entity would have a valuation of about $14 billion.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok, according to the White House. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The full roster of U.S. investors and their stakes in the company remain unclear, but Vance said Thursday the administration is planning to announce the other investors in the coming days.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "CBS News contributor Christopher Krebs, the former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said there are \"still some questions on how operationally ... it's going to play out and what the user is going to experience on a daily basis.\"",
      "There's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern Friday and said he has asked for an \"urgent\" briefing from the Trump administration.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",
      "The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress, however, left it up to the president to ultimately determine what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\" The law gives the president the power to decide, through an interagency process, whether \"the relevant foreign adversary controlled application [is] no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" It defines \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" as a company headquartered in a foreign adversary country and owning at least a 20% stake.",
      "According to the executive order, the joint venture resolves national security concerns because ByteDance will have a minority stake; the joint venture will operate the algorithm and code and make content-moderation decisions; the data of U.S. users will be stored in a cloud environment run by an American company; and the arrangement includes \"intense monitoring\" of software updates, algorithms and data.",
      "\"These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it,\" it says.",
      "The interagency process was led by Vance and included consultation with the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Treasury Department, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "\"This process has included, among other things, significant interagency deliberations and consultations, numerous briefings by informed experts and national security officials, and extensive negotiations with outside parties,\" the executive order says.",
      "The senior White House official said the administration plans to engage \"vigorously\" with lawmakers \"to show them what a great deal this is\" for Americans while also making the app \"safe and secure.\"",
      "During the legal battle over the law, TikTok's lawyers said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that global content will still be accessible for American users.",
      "For that to happen, the U.S. algorithm would have to interact with the original algorithm that feeds the rest of the world content, according to Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University.",
      "\"The semantics associated with how that'll work have not been disclosed at all,\" Lightman said.",
      "Lightman added that the level of complexity involved in retraining an algorithm to run off a smaller set of users and potentially weighting data sets differently while also maintaining the quality of the current user experience is \"huge.\"",
      "\"The TikTok algorithm has been optimized over a long period of time to understand its community's interests and what defines value for them,\" he said. \"It's kind of it's impossible to recreate.\"",

      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",
      "Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions.",
      "REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2015. In 2023, Unicomer Group acquired RadioShack, and in 2024, relaunched it as an e-commerce platform. RadioShack's current owners are not named in the lawsuit.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, when it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",
      "The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, \"made material misrepresentations\" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were \"on fire\" and that \"cash flow is strong.\" They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be invested in that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC's lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "\"Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits,\" the suit states. \"Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations.\"",
      "Neither Mehr nor Lopez immediately responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The SEC alleges that at least $5.9 million of returns paid to investors were actually Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors, as opposed to companies' profits.",
      "Additionally, the federal regulatory agency claims that Mehr and Lopez allocated $16 million worth of investments for their own use, according to the filing.",
      "REV Chief Operating Officer Maya Burkenroad is also accused of aiding Lopez and Mehr's alleged crimes. On REV's website, Burkenroad, who is Lopez's cousin, was described as having \"over 10 years of experience managing multi-million-dollar companies,\" according to the complaint.",
      "But the SEC claims Lopez and Mehr misrepresented her experience. Before joining REV, she had worked as a substitute preschool teacher, a promoter at a radio station, and as an assistant to Lopez at a prior endeavor, the complaint alleges.",

The Consumer Price Index (CPI), another key measure of inflation that tracks the change in prices on everyday items, also ticked higher last month.",
      "The ongoing strain of higher prices is taking a toll on Americans. A CBS News poll released earlier this month showed many are souring at the state of the economy. Two-thirds of the 2,344 U.S. adults polled said prices are still going up, with the same amount saying they expect prices to keep escalating in the coming months.",
      "Last week, the Fed went ahead and reduced the rate for the first time this year, lowering borrowing costs to help a deteriorating U.S. job market. But it's been cautious about cutting, waiting to see what impact President Donald Trump's sweeping taxes on imports have on inflation and the broader economy.",
      "For months, Trump has relentlessly pushed the Fed to lower rates more aggressively, calling Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"Too Late\" and a \"moron\" and arguing that there is \"no inflation.\"",
      "It's widely expected that the Fed will cut rates at its next meeting, which is scheduled for Oct. 28 - 29.",
      "\"This inline PCE today can keep the focus of the Fed on their full employment mandate, which will give them room to continue normalization of the Fed Funds rate,\" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment firm B. Riley Financial, said in an email note.",
      "Last month, Trump sought to fire Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed's governing board, in an effort to gain greater control over the central bank. She has challenged her dismissal in court, and the Supreme Court will decide whether she can stay on the job while the case goes through the judicial system.",
      "The Fed tends to favor the PCE inflation gauge that the government issued Friday over the better-known consumer price index. The PCE index tries to account for changes in how people shop when inflation jumps. It can capture, for example, when consumers switch from pricier national brands to cheaper store brands.",

      "These calls could be played back by intelligence officers, and The Guardian cited three sources within Unit 8200 who said the database was used to help shape military operations in Gaza and the West Bank, and to prepare deadly airstrikes by helping with research and to identify bombing targets in Gaza.",

      "\"When they need to arrest someone and there isn't a good enough reason to do so, that's where they find the excuse,\" one source told the British newspaper.",
      "The Guardian reported that leaked Microsoft files suggested a large proportion of the sensitive data was potentially being stored in Microsoft data centers in Ireland and the Netherlands.",
      "After the publication of its report, several sources told the newspaper that the repository of intercepted calls \u2014 as much as 8,000 terabytes of data \u2014 had been held in a Microsoft data center in the Netherlands, but within days of its report being published in early August, the data appeared to have been moved out of the country.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday approved a $1.5 billion settlement between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors who allege nearly half a million books had been illegally pirated to train chatbots.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued the preliminary approval in San Francisco federal court Thursday after the two sides worked to address his concerns about the settlement, which will pay authors and publishers about $3,000 for each of the books covered by the agreement. It does not apply to future works.",
      "\"This is a fair settlement,\" Alsup said, though he added that distributing it to all parties will be \"complicated.\" About 465,000 books are on the list of works pirated by Anthropic, according to Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors.",
      "\"We have some of the best lawyers in America in this courtroom and if anyone can do it, you can,\" Alsup said.",
      "The Association of American Publishers called the settlement a \"major step in the right direction in holding AI developers accountable for reckless and unabashed infringement.\"",
      "\"Anthropic is hardly a special case when it comes to infringement. Every other major AI developer has trained their models on the backs of authors and publishers, and many have sourced those works from the most notorious infringing sites in the world,\" said Maria A. Pallante, president and CEO of the publisher group.",
      "San Francisco-based Anthropic said it is pleased with the preliminary approval.",
      "\"The decision will allow us to focus on developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems. As we've consistently maintained, the court's landmark June ruling that AI training constitutes transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement simply resolves narrow claims about how certain materials were obtained,\" said Aparna Sridhar, deputy general counsel at Anthropic.",
      "The Authors Guild, meanwhile, said the settlement \"marks a milestone in authors' fights against AI companies' theft of their works. It sends a clear signal to AI companies that infringement of authors' rights comes at a steep price and will undoubtedly push AI companies towards acquiring the books they want legally, through licensing.\"",
      "A Monday filing sought to convince the judge that the parties have set up a system designed to get out robust notice to all authors and publishers covered by the agreement, ensuring they get their cut of the pot if they want to sign off on the settlement or opt out to protect their legal rights moving forward.",
      "They also tried to assure him that the author and publishers group that cobbled the deal together are not doing any \"back room\" dealings that would hurt lesser-known authors.",
      "Alsup's main concern centered on how the claims process will be handled in an effort to ensure everyone eligible knows about it so the authors don't \"get the shaft.\" He had set a Sept. 22 deadline for submitting a claims form for him to review before Thursday's hearing to review the settlement again.",
      "The judge had raised worries about two big groups connected to the case \u2014 the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers \u2014 working \"behind the scenes\" in ways that could pressure some authors to accept the settlement without fully understanding it.",
      "Attorneys for the authors said in Monday's filing they believe the settlement will result in a high claims rate, respects existing contracts and is \"consistent with due process\" and the court's guidance.",
      "Alsup had dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn't illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites to help improve its Claude chatbot.",
      "Bestselling thriller novelist Andrea Bartz, who sued Anthropic with two other authors last year, said in a court declaration ahead of the hearing that she strongly supports the settlement and will work to explain its significance to fellow writers.",
      "\"Together, authors and publishers are sending a message to AI companies: You are not above the law, and our intellectual property isn't yours for the taking,\" she wrote.",
      "Alsup also said in the courtroom Thursday that he plans to step down from the bench by the end of the year. President Bill Clinton nominated him for the federal bench in 1999.",

      "The overhaul will cost $1 billion, according to a Thursday regulatory filing. Most of the costs are related to the store closures, such as $450 million in costs for breaking leases early. About $150 million will cover expenses for cutting the 900 employees, who Niccol said are \"nonretail\" workers.",
      "Niccol disclosed the plan in a letter to employees, but didn't specify how many locations would be shuttered. He did note that after adding some new locations over the last year, the company's overall store count in North America will decline by about 1% in fiscal year 2025.",

      "After 85 years of sending out paper checks to retirees, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is transitioning to electronic payments in what it says is an effort to modernize its services and improve efficiency.",
      "Starting Sept. 30, the SSA will no longer issue paper checks to its nearly 70 million recipients, instead sending benefits through either direct deposit or a prepaid debit card.",
      "\"We have been communicating directly with beneficiaries since July 1, and we have worked diligently to ensure that the less than one percent of individuals who receive paper checks have ample time to enroll in direct deposit or receive Direct Express cards,\" a Social Security spokesperson told CBS News in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"By moving to electronic payments exclusively, we aim to improve efficiency, security, and ensure beneficiaries receive their monthly benefits promptly,\" they added.",
      "The Social Security Administration has emphasized that electronic payments provide a safer and more secure way to receive benefits compared with paper checks, which the agency says are 16 times more likely to be lost or stolen. Eliminating paper checks is also a cost-saving measure: Checks cost 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer.",
      "In an online post, the SSA said it was sending notices to people who receive paper checks to alert them of the change. The agency encouraged paper check recipients to switch to the new payment options before the deadline to ensure they receive their benefits in a timely fashion.",
      "The Social Security spokesperson declined to comment on how people were contacted or on the current status of its outreach.",
      "Exceptions for some paper checks",

      "\"The U.S. Department of the Treasury will grant exceptions to the rule for qualifying circumstances,\" the spokesperson said, without elaborating on what the qualifying circumstances are or the steps Social Security recipients would need to take to establish they qualify.",
      "President Trump set the shift away from paper checks in motion with a March executive order that mandated all federal payments be digitized. Paper-based checks, the White House said at the time, impose \"unnecessary costs; delays; and risks of fraud, lost payments, theft, and inefficiencies.\"",
      "Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, as well as advocates for seniors have noted that the roughly 600,000 people who rely on the SSA's original payment system often need paper checks because they're unable to receive electronic deposits.",
      "That includes people who are \"unbanked,\" or those who lack access to traditional bank accounts. According to an August report from Bankrate, the unbanked represent 4.6% of the U.S. population, and tend to rely more on check-cashing services and other alternative forms of payment to manage their finances.",
      "While the Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it wasn't until\u00a01940\u00a0that the agency began sending paper checks to retired workers and their dependents as well as to survivors of deceased insured workers. The first recipient of the monthly benefit was a woman named Ida M. Fuller.",
      "A Vermont native, Fuller worked as a teacher before becoming a legal secretary. After filing her retirement claim in 1939, she stopped by the Social Security office in Rutland, Vermont, the town where she once attended school, to inquire about her benefits.

The rule had been set to take effect July 14, but was blocked by a federal court that month.",
      "\"We hope the FTC resurrects the click-to-cancel rules to protect millions of consumers from shady sales tactics,\" said Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a nonprofit public interest group, in en email. \"In the meantime, we hope this Amazon settlement sends a strong message to any company operating in ways that could conceivably confuse customers or thwart their efforts to not be customers any more.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/seasonal-retail-hiring-on-track-to-fall-to-lowest-level-since-2009/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 18:05:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Retailers are expected to hire fewer seasonal workers this year as tariffs and inflationary pressures roil the economy.",
    "story": [
      "Retailers around the U.S. are expected to sharply reduce the number of workers they add for the holidays, a shift from their usual seasonal hiring sprees to help cope with the annual crush of customers.",
      "Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas attributes the weak demand for extra workers this year to companies bearing the heavier costs from U.S. tariffs on foreign goods, as well as on rising inflation and their growing reliance on technology to improve efficiency.",
      "The firm expects retail hiring fo the holidays to fall to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was emerging from a recession caused by the global financial crisis.",
      "\"Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,\" Andy Challenger, workplace expert and senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "The weaker seasonal hiring forecast comes as the U.S. job market is faltering. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of economists' expectations.",
      "Inflation has also edged up in recent months. The Consumer Price Index, which in March had sunk to an annual rate of 2.3%, in August\u00a0rose at a 2.9%\u00a0pace from a year ago.",
      "In the last quarter of 2024, retailers added just over 543,000 seasonal workers, down roughly 4% compared to 2023. Companies are projected to add fewer than 500,000 jobs during the last three months of 2025, according to Challenger. Such a figure would mark the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years.",
      "Challenger pointed to fewer seasonal hiring announcements than usual from retailers as a sign they plan to hire fewer workers for the holidays.",
      "\"While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge. This year may be more about doing more with less,\" Challenger said.",
      "Tariffs are causing some consumers to pull back on spending, recent data shows. An August survey\u00a0of consumers from the University of Michigan found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that see tariff-driven price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that rise substantially in price, according to the report.",
      "Tariffs have already driven up the cost of some categories of goods for U.S. consumers. For example, in August, audio equipment rose in price by 12% compared to one year earlier,\u00a0 while the cost of household goods rose 10%, the latest Consumer Price Index report\u00a0shows.",
      "\"A wave of uncertainty is impacting not just retailers, but also consumers heading into the final quarter of the year. With hiring slowing across the board, Retailers may hire fewer workers themselves, while many of their shoppers slow spending,\" Challenger added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/h-1b-visa-new-fee-immigration-impact-american-workers/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:23:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The large fee could help some U.S. workers find jobs, but there could be longer-term costs, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says the new $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will spur companies to hire Americans instead of bringing in labor from overseas. Yet many economists predict the results will be more mixed, potentially fostering increased domestic hiring in some industries but slowing long-term economic growth with a knock-on effect on overall employment.",
      "\"I could envision a scenario in which otherwise available [American] employees see a large increase for their labor demand,\" Kirk Doran, associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, said of the new visa policy. \"There is some evidence that for the kind of work H-1B employees do, there are available workers looking for jobs right now.\"",
      "In the near term, some technology industry workers in particular could see job gains as more companies seek to avoid the sharply higher costs of bringing in employees from overseas, Rutgers University labor economist Jennifer Hunt told CBS News.",
      "\"The winners would be U.S. native-born computer programmers,\" she said. \"If you're a native worker who is really similar to an immigrant, immigrants are usually bad for you. So we would expect current American, U.S. programmers to be helped.\"",
      "Yet the bigger picture is more complex. Other economic research shows that hiring immigrant workers often benefits companies, providing a ready source of skilled labor with the education and training that may not be widely available in the U.S.",
      "One 2024 study from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment said H-1B workers can \"help firms increase their employment, revenues and survival probabilities,\" while finding no evidence that hiring of foreign labor through the program displaced native-born American workers.",
      "The research \u2014 from economists at IZA, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, University of Delaware, University of Michigan and Queens College, CUNY \u2014 also found that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains. \"High-wage, high-productivity firms expand more and even crowd-in natives with college degrees\" when able to add H-1B workers, they wrote.",
      "George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens underlined that H-1B workers with specialized skills can help boost a company's revenue and profits, potentially spawning other kinds of jobs at the employer, such as in sales and marketing, that can be filled by U.S. workers.",
      "As a result, Clemens worries that the policy change would hurt Americans' job prospects over the long term. \"It is going to choke off job opportunities for the people it is supposed to help,\" he said.",
      "Cost of restricting immigration",
      "To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company. Congress caps the number of H-1B visas \u2014 which are valid for three years and which can be extended for an additional three years \u2014 at 85,000 annually. Roughly 700,000 workers in the U.S. hold H-1B visas, according to Capital Economics.",
      "\"The costs of restricting immigration are widespread,\" Gaurav Khanna, a University of California San Diego professor of economics focusing on migration, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"On net, it benefits U.S. workers more than it hurts them, such that the benefits outweigh the costs. The visas allow the IT companies to grow quite rapidly, and these IT firms start hiring other workers in management positions and in HR, so it leads to employment growth at these firms.\"",
      "The White House dismissed the notion that hiring workers from abroad also benefits U.S. workers.",
      "\"President Trump continues to prove to so-called 'experts' wrong time and time again \u2013 no 'economic study' can change the reality lived by many Americans across the country who bore the brunt of the massive abuse of the H-1B system,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "Rogers added that the visa fee protects \"Americans from cheap, foreign labor.\"",
      "In a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump said H-1B visas disadvantage Americans by allowing companies to exploit the program to \"replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\" That has stunted job opportunities and undermined wages, he added.",
      "How much do H-1B workers earn?",
      "Some research supports this claim. For example, an August analysis\u00a0from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, found that H-1B workers earn significantly less than their American counterparts.",
      "\"[M]any employers may be using the H-1B program not to attract top-tier global talent, but to fill roles at below-median wage levels\u2014raising questions about the program's alignment with its stated objectives,\" the report said.",
      "Other changes could be coming to the H-1B program, with the Trump administration aiming to tilt it toward better-paid foreign workers. On Monday, it proposed replacing the lottery with a system that would favor immigrants with advanced skills and higher incomes.",
      "The Heritage report also notes that the visas restrict worker mobility by tying a visa holder to a given company, preventing them from seeking other employment. That can make such workers more desirable to employers than native workers, who can leave their jobs at any time, the report explains.",
      "In this sense, companies' reliance on the program can hurt native workers, the group said.",
      "\"But this creates an uneven playing field: Native workers, who are free to switch jobs or negotiate better pay, may be overlooked not because they lack skills, but because they are not as easily retained or controlled,\" wrote Alexander Frei, the report's author and formerly a senior research associate at Heritage. \"As a result, employers may favor visa-bound workers who accept lower wages and fewer demands, driving down bargaining power and wage growth for equally or more qualified U.S. workers.\"",
      "Other groups have\u00a0criticized the H-1B program for disproportionately benefiting large, multinational firms that can enter thousands of visa applicants in the lottery and hire whomever is successful.",

      "U.S. District Judge Melissa Damian ruled Friday that the consumers who filed the class-action lawsuit failed to show that the lack of confectionary details on the chocolate and peanut butter candies, such as missing mouths and eyes on jack-'o-lanterns, ghosts and other Halloween-themed figures, had cause them economic harm.",
      "Damian pointed out that while the consumers may have been disappointed by the chocolates' unwrapped appearances, the candies were not \"so flawed as to render them worthless.\" In other words, the chocolate still tasted like chocolate, even if they weren't as haunting as the purchasers had expected from the packaging.",
      "The lawsuit focused on several Hershey candies that are marketed around Halloween, including its Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins and its Reese's White Ghost, as well as a few other holiday-themed chocolates like its Reese's Peanut Butter Shapes Assortment Snowmen Stockings Bells.",
      "The original lawsuit, filed in 2024, claimed that Hershey used deceptive advertising because the \"artistic designs\" depicted on the wrappers were absent from the actual candies.",
      "But the difference between the wrappers and the chocolates' actual appearances wasn't enough to prove \"a concrete economic injury,\" Damian wrote on Friday.",
      "\"Plaintiffs' conclusory allegations as to why they have allegedly been deprived of the benefit of their bargain all boil down to their subjective, personal expectations of how the products would or should have looked when unpackaged,\" the judge added.",
      "Anthony Russo, an attorney for the consumers who sued Hershey, said that they intend to amend the complaint.",
      "\"The court is merely saying that the plaintiffs did not expressly allege in the complaint that the products were worthless to them or that they paid a price premium and allowed plaintiffs to amend the complaint, which they will be doing,\" Russo told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "For car buyers interested in electric vehicles, the clock is ticking to take advantage of federal tax credits on new and used EVs before they expire on Sept. 30.",
      "Introduced in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act signed, the federal tax credits \u2014 $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used \u2014 are being phased out due to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is also\u00a0ending a series\u00a0\u00a0of other clean energy credits over the next several months.",
      "With just one week to go until the expiration date of the Biden-era EV credit, customers are flocking to dealerships to cash in. EV sales reached a record high in August, with new EV sales up 17.7% year over year and used EV sales up 59% for the same period, data from Cox Automotive shows.",
      "\"As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August's elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,\" Cox Automotive said in its report.",
      "The findings jibe with data from Cars Commerce \u2014 whose holdings include\u00a0Cars.com\u00a0\u2014 that shows\u00a0 a 33% surge in EV demand since last year as shoppers rush to take advantage of the credits. The automotive tech company also found that used EVs are on dealers' lots for 46 days on average, a nearly 30% decrease from last last year that indicates the sector of the EV market is rising in popularity.",
      "Deals to be had",
      "Anxious to clear out EV inventory before the arrival of new models in November, dealerships have been offering their own incentives, such as monthly lease rates that are are as little as 1% of the car's sticker price.",
      "The Emich Volkswagen dealership in Denver has lowered EV lease rates to $40 a month. \"This deal is absurd and it's never gonna happen again,\" Philip De Jong, the marketing director at Emich, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "One customer at the Denver dealership, Stephen Hynes, told CBS News' senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave that that he would save as much as $400 a month compared with his last car payment.",

      "A chart below from Cars.com\u00a0shows which vehicles are still eligible for the federal tax credit, based on information from Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "What will happen after the tax credit ends?",
      "September 2025 could end up being the \"single biggest EV month in history,\" Tim Horvick, owner of the San Tan Ford dealership outside of Phoenix, told CBS' Van Cleave. But come October, when the EV credit is no longer in effect, the sales landscape could shift.",
      "\"It is the concern,\" Horvick said. \"It could be challenging.\"",
      "As a result of the coming end of the tax credit, along with other\u00a0policy changes introduced by the Trump administration, automakers have already slowed their production of electric vehicles, shifting their attention to more popular gas and hybrid models, CBS News reported.",
      "But not all experts believe the expiration of the tax credit will have a huge effect on future EV sales, and that's simply because sales were low to begin with.",
      "EV sales \"can't fall off a cliff because they're not very high,\" Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy, told CBS News' Van Cleave. \"They're gonna fall off a small hill because that's as high as they got.\"",
      "Electric vehicles make up about 7% of new car sales, according to Anderson Economic Group. A recent analysis from Kelley Blue Book shows EV sales in August accounted for a record 9.9% of total car sales, up from 9.1% in July.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs if Congress remains at an impasse over government funding, with a shutdown set to begin Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill has stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes are needed to advance it. Democrats want an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have opposed. Without a resolution, the government will begin to shut down on Wednesday.",
      "If funding lapses, federal employees in critical positions would be required to stay on the job. Many others would be forced to stay home. Both groups would have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown threat means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid if there's a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck even if they haven't reached a deal to fund the government.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" This means they must get paid whether or not other parts of the government are funded.",
      "Pursuant to that section, members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election. Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "summary": "The agency's Bureau of Labor Statistics would suspend operations if the U.S. government shuts down this week, potentially delaying key economic reports.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Labor said it would delay releases of economic data if the federal government shuts down\u00a0this week, which could postpone Friday's highly anticipated monthly jobs report.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department posted a 73-page \"contingency plan\" detailing operations if government funding lapses at midnight on Sept. 30. If that occurs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) would suspend all operations, including data collection activities for BLS surveys, website updates and economic reports, the plan states.",
      "The BLS is scheduled to release its report on September employment gains on Oct. 3. In a shutdown, government agencies must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded from other sources, such as fees, or under other legislation.",
      "The BLS' closely watched monthly jobs report drew scrutiny last month when President Trump\u00a0fired its commissioner of labor statistics after disappointing employment numbers. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled it is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness amid a hiring slowdown.",
      "Awkward timing",
      "Earlier this month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited headwinds facing the labor market as a key factor in the central bank's vote for an\u00a0interest rate cut\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "\"The timing of the looming potential government shutdown is not ideal for the Fed, which is set to meet again on October 29th,\" said Mike Reid, senior U.S. economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, in a research report.",
      "Although it's unclear whether a shutdown will occur or how long it could last, the possibility raises the risk that some government economic reports would not be available to the Fed before its next meeting on Oct. 29, he added.",
      "\"In our view, an increasingly data dependent Federal Reserve with limited visibility into the September data increases the probability of an October pause,\" meaning that the Fed could hold off on an additional rate cut at the Oct. 29 meeting, Reid\u00a0wrote.",
      "Earlier this month, the BLS reported that\u00a0employers added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' forecasts. The September report, scheduled for Friday, is expected to show about 50,500 new hires, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "\"We believe that a shutdown will have only a small and transitory economic impact, but it may spur some financial market volatility, especially if delays in government economic reports obscure the path of Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts,\" said Jennifer Timmerman, investment strategy analyst, in a Wells Fargo Investment Institute\u00a0report\u00a0released Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Sunday that a government shutdown is likely unless top Democrats back down from their negotiating position.",
      "\"I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview with CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump also expressed confidence that the American people will side with him if government funding expires in the coming days, and he believes Democrats will pay a political price for not working with him, on his terms, to further cut spending.",
      "\"They're not interested in fraud, waste and abuse,\" Mr. Trump said of the Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump will meet Monday with congressional leaders ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline for lawmakers to reach an agreement on a spending bill that would avert a shutdown.",
      "A source close to Mr. Trump told CBS News that the president privately welcomes the prospect of a shutdown because it will enable him to wield executive power to slash some government programs and salaries.",
      "Last week, the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies telling them to prepare layoff plans if there is a government shutdown.",
      "The memo, obtained by CBS News, tells agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices \u2014 a federal term for layoffs \u2014 for employees in programs, projects or activities that have discretionary funding that stops on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. It also goes further and says that employees should get RIF notices if they're in programs or projects \"not consistent with the President's priorities.\"",
      "In the interview Sunday, Mr. Trump cast the Democrats' current demands \u2014\u00a0 which in recent weeks have focused on seeking to extend Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies \u2014\u00a0 as ill-advised.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said, if the Democrats want to discuss health care, they should work with him to prevent undocumented migrants from accessing public benefits.",
      "\"The Democrats, incredibly, want to keep their old policies of open borders and we're not going to have it. We're not going to allow it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Any possible health-care negotiations, Mr. Trump added, must address immigration and border-related matters, otherwise, \"It's just not acceptable for us.\"",
      "Democrats have forcefully pushed back against Mr. Trump's characterization of their positions on both government funding and on immigration. And they have repeatedly noted that people who are in the U.S. illegally are not eligible to receive Medicaid coverage.",
      "\"Donald Trump knows, or at least I think he knows, that current federal law prohibits using taxpayer dollars for undocumented immigrants in connection with their health care. And no one is trying to change or reverse that law,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told MSNBC on Saturday. \"What we are doing is fighting to protect the healthcare of everyday Americans in the midst of this Republican-caused crisis that is devastating hospitals and nursing homes and community-based health clinics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet Monday with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Jeffries.",
      "The meeting comes after the president canceled an initial meeting last week, citing the Democrats' \"unserious and ridiculous\" demands.",
      "Earlier this month, the House approved a GOP-led continuing resolution to keep the government funded until Nov. 21. But Democrats put forward their own proposal that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31, along with implementing other priorities for the party, including their health-care request. In the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to advance most legislation, both the bill passed by the House\u00a0to fund the government and the Democrats' proposal fell short.",
      "The Democrats' proposal included a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which Democrats have suggested is a red line for their support. The proposal would also roll back cuts to Medicaid in Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "The Senate is returning to Washington on Monday after a weeklong recess, and will have little time to act to avert a shutdown. Echoing Mr. Trump, Thune told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that it's \"totally up to the Democrats\" whether the government shuts down, saying \"there is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now\" that the House passed that would keep the government open.",
      "\"This decision, in my judgment at this point in time, is up to a handful of Democrats,\" Thune said. \"We need eight Democrats to pass it through the Senate.\"",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, told \"Face the Nation\" Sunday that \"Democrats are united in pushing\" on the health-care issue, adding that she's glad the president has decided to meet with leaders in Congress.",
      "\"This is an opportunity for the country because of one big problem, and that is that the Republicans have created a health care crisis,\" Klobuchar said. \"My constituents, Americans, are standing on a cliff right now with these insurance premium increases that are upon them.\"",

    "story": [
      "The 22-year-old man charged with killing Charlie Kirk\u00a0appeared in court remotely on Monday. During the hearing, the suspect and his newly appointed legal counsel decided they want a preliminary hearing where the judge will determine if there is enough evidence against him to go forward with a trial.",
      "Prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson with aggravated murder and plan to seek the death penalty. Robinson didn't enter a plea during Monday's hearing.",
      "The Utah state court system gives people accused of crimes an option to waive their legal right to a preliminary hearing and instead schedule an arraignment where they can enter a plea. Kathryn Nester, the lead attorney appointed to represent Robinson, said that the defense team would need time to go through all of the evidence in the case before letting the judge know when they would be ready for the hearing.",
      "\"Until we can kinda get our heads around exactly what we're dealing with and how much we need to process, it's going to be difficult for us to give you a reasonable expectation of when we will be ready to do the prelim,\" Nester told Judge Tony Graf Jr.",
      "Robinson is scheduled to appear in person for his next hearing on Oct. 30. The hearing in Provo was open to the public, just a few miles from the Utah Valley University campus in Orem, where the Sept. 10 shooting\u00a0happened, launching a day-and-a-half search for the suspect.",
      "Graf told prosecutors and the defense lawyers that Robinson's constitutional rights would be protected as the case moves forward.",
      "\"He sits before this court presumed innocent, and that presumption remains unless and until each element of every offense charged against him is proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the judge said. \"At the same time and as applicable, victims are entitled under our Constitution to be treated with fairness, respect and dignity, free from harassment or abuse. Justice demands that both of these principles \u2014 the rights of the accused and the rights of victims \u2014 be honored without compromise.\"",
      "Authorities arrested Robinson when he showed up with his parents at his hometown sheriff's office in southwest Utah, more than a three-hour drive from the site of the shooting, to turn himself in. Prosecutors have since revealed text messages and DNA evidence that they say connect Robinson to the killing.",
      "Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray told reporters before the first hearing  that Robinson's mother had said her son had begun to date his roommate, who was transitioning from male to female.",
      "A note that Robinson had allegedly left for his roommate before the shooting said he had the opportunity to kill one of the nation's leading conservative voices, \"and I'm going to take it,\" Gray said. Gray also said that Robinson wrote in a text about Kirk to his roommate: \"I had enough of his hatred.\"",
      "According to court documents, Robinson allegedly wrote in a text, \"To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age.\"",
      "When the roommate asked Robinson if he was Kirk's shooter, Robinson allegedly replied, \"I am, I'm sorry.\"",
      "The assassination of Kirk, a close ally of President Trump who worked to steer young voters toward conservatism, has galvanized Republicans who have vowed to carry on Kirk's mission of moving American politics further to the right.",
      "Mr. Trump has declared Kirk a \"martyr\" for freedom and threatened to crack down on what he called the \"radical left.\"",
      "Workers across the country have been punished or fired for speaking out about Kirk after his death, including teachers, public and private employees and media personalities \u2014 most notably Jimmy Kimmel, who had his late-night show suspended then quickly reinstated by ABC.",
      "Kirk's political organization, Arizona-based Turning Point USA, brought young, evangelical Christians into politics through his podcast, social media and campus events. Many prominent Republicans are filling in at the upcoming campus events Kirk was meant to attend, including Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and Sen. Mike Lee at Utah State University on Tuesday.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government could shut down on Wednesday if Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even if a U.S.\u00a0government shutdown begins on Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress, with lawmakers currently at loggerheads over funding the federal government past Sept. 30.",
      "If an agreement isn't reached before then, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for their operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan published by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 13:17:33 -0400",
    "summary": "While the tariffs will impact everyone to some degree, experts say more of the pain will be felt by lower-income consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Fresh tariffs on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities recently announced by President Trump on social media\u00a0could cause already high prices to rise even further, and deter some Americans from embarking on home renovation projects.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday said his administration will levy a 50% tariff on all imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and \"associated products,\" plus a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture from abroad.",
      "Preventing what he called the \"flooding\" of such goods into the U.S. is a matter of national security, the president added. Both sets of tariffs will kick in Oct. 1, he said. \"It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture \u2014 much of which is imported \u2014 rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025,\u00a0the latest CPI data shows, driven by Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs, according to economists.\u00a0Furniture and bedding also rose 4.7% over the same period, and 2.8% for household furnishings and supplies.",
      "If the new levies go into effect, furniture makers will feel the hit, and some will likely pass the costs on to consumers, industry analysts told CBS News. The sectoral tariffs could also hinder business activity and growth, they added, as companies wait to see if tariff policies change and defer investment decisions.",
      "\"Higher prices are an inevitable consequence of these tariffs,\" Zak Stambor, a retail analyst at market research company eMarketer, told CBS News. \"People undergoing bathroom or kitchen renovations are in a tough spot right now because there was so little warning. The costs of those things will now be higher, and people might not have already bought them because they were waiting for permits.\"",
      "Low-income consumers will feel the squeeze the most, not just because they have less discretionary income but because lower-cost furniture sold in the U.S. tends to be imported from Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia and India.",
      "Some higher-end furniture is manufactured in the U.S., and therefore less exposed to tariffs, according to Telsey Advisory Group managing director and senior retail analyst Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. She said retailers will have no choice but to raise prices on imported goods once the tariffs take effect.",
      "\"They are trying not to raise prices too much ahead of holiday season. But they can't absorb 30% tariffs on top of other tariffs that are already in place,\" she told CBS News. \"They'll have to pass through pricing, probably in the form of a double-digit price increase.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News's request for comment on analysts' claims the tariffs could drive up prices or inhibit business investment.",
      "Uncertainty persists",
      "From retailers' point of view, the levies could make investing in new inventory a riskier and more difficult proposition, according to Stambor, as costs and consumer demand could shift.",
      "\"Retailers' only certainty is that uncertainty is here to stay. What's true today very well may not be true tomorrow and that makes life incredibly challenging,\" he said.",
      "Naturepedic, an Ohio-based maker of organic mattresses and bedroom furniture, said it had been planning to launch an upholstered product line in late 2025 or early 2026, including headboards. However, as of Thursday, it is reconsidering that expansion.",
      "\"We are having to go back to the drawing board a little bit,\" Naturepedic Chief Growth Officer Arin Schultz told CBS News. \"We might drop it if it doesn't make sense, even though we're pretty far along in the process.\"",
      "Of the tariffs announced on Thursday, he said, \"If they could turn around and not do it, that would be great.\"",
      "Cost to consumers",
      "John Mercer, head of global research at Coresight Research, a provider of retail industry insights, doesn't expect all manufacturers to pass on all tariff-related costs to the consumer, and says some will likely take steps to mitigate the impact.",
      "Firms with larger inventories will be able to sell through what they have in stock before implementing any price hikes, while on-demand furniture makers may have to raise prices sooner, rather than later, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing.",
      "Mercer, however, doesn't expect the levies to compel makers of upholstered furniture and cabinetry to quickly move production to the U.S.",
      "\"Generally, that's not easy, and it's more expensive,\" he said. \"There is a reason why companies have offshored production, and that's because because it's traditionally much cheaper.\"",

    "summary": "With the federal government on the brink of another lapse in funding, here's a look at the 14 shutdowns that have occurred since 1980.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress appears to be barreling toward another government shutdown, with President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward for averting a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump said Sunday that a shutdown is likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president is set to meet with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, though a breakthrough to avert a shutdown appears to be a long way off.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, year-long spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0On Nov. 20, 1981, the Senate approved legislation that fell short of spending cuts Reagan had sought. The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The one-day shutdown was not the result of a bitter stalemate, but happened because members of Congress were busy with social commitments.",
      "The New York Times reported at the time\u00a0that \"congressional leaders barred a late-night session because of major social events tonight by both Republicans and Democrats.\" Reagan had invited members of Congress to a barbecue at the White House, while Democrats had a $1,000-per-plate fundraising dinner.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown arose in part from Reagan's opposition to a measure that included billions in funding for a jobs creation program and Democrats' opposition to money for the MX missile program.",
      "Congress walked away from the jobs provision but included money for legal support for low-income Americans. Lawmakers also declined to fund the missile program, but Reagan still signed the legislation to end the shutdown.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown stemmed from Democrats adding roughly $1 billion in education spending, and cutting foreign aid. House Democrats ended up decreasing their request for education spending to $100 million and provided money for the MX missile, which Reagan wanted. Democrats kept their cuts to foreign aid and defense.",

      "Duration: Two days",
      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Reagan and congressional Democrats were at odds over several provisions included in a funding bill that cleared the House, namely a crime bill favored by the president, and a water projects measure he opposed. Democrats also wanted legislation reversing a Supreme Court decision that found entire colleges that did not accept federal or state funding were not subject to Title IX's requirements even though their students did receive federal assistance.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The stopgap funding measure passed days earlier didn't do enough to stave off another shutdown. Democrats ultimately gave in and removed the water projects and civil rights provisions, and Congress passed the crime bill.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Democrats",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The lapse in government funding was the result of disagreement over providing aid to the Contras in Nicaragua and Democrats' push to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine, a policy from the Federal Communications Commission that required broadcast licensees to cover different sides of controversial issues. The rule was repealed in 1987.",
      "In the end, Congress approved nonlethal aid for the Nicaraguan rebels, but Democrats were unsuccessful in their efforts to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine.",

      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Bush said he would veto a short-term funding measure that did not include a plan to reduce the deficit, forcing a shutdown.

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdowns that occurred during Clinton's presidency centered around his dispute with congressional Republicans of their pledge to balance the budget and repeal the president's 1993 tax increases. The GOP, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, took control of the House for the first time in 40 years in 1995 in what would be remembered as the \"Republican Revolution.\"",
      "The GOP-led Congress passed a short-term continuing resolution that sought to boost Medicare premiums and required the president to balance the budget within seven years, among other measures. But Clinton vetoed the legislation, which led to a shutdown.",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this. I mean, it's gotten to the point where it's a little ridiculous, as far as this senator is concerned.\"",

      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The fight began over the Affordable Care Act and a push by Republicans to dismantle key parts of Obama's signature health care law. The GOP-led House passed two spending bills, one of which would've delayed implementation of Obamacare, which were both rejected by the Democratic-led Senate.",
      "Obama called for a spending bill with no conditions attached, but Republicans ultimately opted to shut down the government over their opposition to the landmark health care law.",
      "House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner in the end ceded to Democrats and approved a short-term spending bill that didn't include changes to Obamacare.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown, which officially began on the one-year anniversary of Trump's inauguration, stemmed from a fight over immigration, and specifically Democrats' demands for protections for \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.",
      "The White House, however, said it would not engage in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which extended legal protections for Dreamers, while the government was shut down.",
      "In the end, Democrats relented after Republicans pledged to work toward a deal addressing DACA, and Trump signed a short-term funding bill that reopened the government.",

      "What happened:\u00a0Months later, immigration was again at the center of the government funding fight, though this shutdown involved Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the former president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested.",

    "summary": "Much of the federal government is on the verge of shutting down\u200b if Congress does not reach a deal to approve new funding by Oct. 1. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government is on the verge of shutting down if Congress does not reach a deal to approve new funding by Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025.",
      "Republicans have proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides are dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders are set to meet with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during a government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "story": [
      "The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the president said he will send troops to Portland, state Attorney General Dan Rayfield announced Sunday.",
      "It comes after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sent a memo to Gov. Tina Kotek authorizing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to the city of Portland, Rayfield said in a news release. The troops are to be deployed for 60 days to protect federal property \"where protests are occurring or likely to occur,\" he said.",
      "The lawsuit argued that President Trump lacks authority to federalize the National Guard. California filed a similar lawsuit in June after the administration sent troops to Los Angeles.",
      "\"Oregon communities are stable, and our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference,\" Rayfield in a statement.",
      "\"Sending in 200 National Guard troops to guard a single building is not normal. If you had a concern about safety at your own home, you'd make a few calls and fill the gaps \u2014 not call in an army. What we're seeing is not about public safety, it's about the President flexing political muscle under the guise of law and order, chasing a media hit at the expense of our community.\"",
      "Mr. Trump posted on social media on Saturday that he had directed Hegseth to send \"all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any other ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.\"",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed Monday that 200 members of the Oregon National Guard are being called into federal service for the next 60 days to protect ICE and other government personnel who are conducting federal duties. While federalized, the National Guard members will be overseen by the commander of U.S. Northern Command.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CBS News Mr. Trump \"is using his lawful authority\" to send troops to Portland, saying that troops are being sent to protect federal assets and personnel \"following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters.\"",
      "Local officials, including Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, have pushed back on Mr. Trump's comments and plans to send troops to the city.",
      "\"When the president and I spoke yesterday, I told him in very plain language that there is no insurrection or a threat to public safety that necessitates military intervention in Portland or any other city in our state, despite this, and with all evidence to the contrary, he has chosen to disregard Oregonian safety and ability to govern themselves,\" Kotek said at a virtual news conference on Sunday.",
      "She said that there have been some demonstrations near a federal facility, but Portland police and federal officials there are capable of handling the situation.",
      "\"And when people cross the line ... there's unlawful activity, people are being held accountable,\" Kotek said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a Portland Police spokesperson said there have been \"an almost constant protest down at the ICE facility in South Portland,\" but did not comment on any arrests.",
      "\"The protest numbers have waxed and waned over time. Last night there were some people down there, and there are more tonight,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin on Wednesday, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap. Federal agencies develop plans ahead of a shutdown to determine which employees will remain working.",
      "For instance, the Department of Health and Human Services posted its shutdown plan on Sept. 25, which states that more than 32,000 employees, or about 41% of the agency's workforce, will be furloughed. The other employees are either funded through sources other than annual appropriations or will continue to work, although without pay, because they are in essential roles.",
      "And while federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "Government shutdowns have typically been short, with the pay of military service persons often seen as a deadline for getting funding restored, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report. The next military pay date at risk from a shutdown would be Oct. 15, they noted.",
      "\"For civilian employees, the first pay date at risk would be Oct. 10 but this is less likely to drive a compromise,\" the analysts noted.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate returns to Washington on Monday with less than two days to fund the government amid a stalemate between Democrats and Republicans on the path forward that has increased the likelihood of a government shutdown this week.",
      "Lawmakers were away on recess last week after the House approved a GOP-led continuing resolution to keep the government funded until Nov. 21. But the measure fell short in the Senate, as Democrats pushed a counter-proposal that would keep the government funded through October, while attaching a handful of their priorities. That measure also failed to secure the necessary support for passage.",
      "Republicans have 53 seats in the Senate, a majority. But with 60 votes needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber, Republicans can't approve a bill to fund the government without the help of Democrats.",
      "With few opportunities to exert influence with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House, Democrats have been pushing to extract a more favorable outcome in the spending fight, facing pressure from their base to push back on the Trump administration's policies. But the posture has proven complicated for the party that has repeatedly supported efforts to keep the government funded.",
      "Democrats push for negotiations",
      "Both parties have pushed for a stopgap measure to keep the government funded while work on full-year appropriations bills continues, but Democrats have advocated for weeks for taking the funding effort to the negotiating table, introducing a counter-proposal earlier this month that appeared to serve as an opening salvo.",
      "While the Republican-led continuing resolution would fund the government until Nov. 21, the Democrats' proposal includes one of their key priorities \u2014 extending expiring health insurance subsidies.",
      "The proposal, which would extend government funding until Oct. 31 and boost security funding, includes a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which Democrats have suggested is a red line for their support. The subsidies, which were originally passed in 2021, are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Also in their proposed measure to fund the government, Democrats included language to roll back Medicaid restrictions in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "Democratic leaders have been pushing for a meeting with Mr. Trump on government funding. And the leaders are set to meet Monday with the president, alongside Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson after the president canceled an initial meeting last week, citing the Democrats' \"unserious and ridiculous\" demands.",
      "Then, the Trump administration upped the ante last week, when the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies Wednesday telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for employees in programs, projects or activities that received discretionary funding.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that he called Thune Friday and urged him to get the leaders together for a meeting. The next day, he said the White House told them the meeting was on for Monday afternoon.",
      "The New York Democrat called the meeting a \"first step,\" saying \"we need a serious negotiation.\"",
      "\"I think they felt the heat, and they now want to sit down,\" Schumer said. \"But the fundamental question hasn't been answered yet, and we'll see on Monday: are they serious about negotiating with us in a real way?\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said Sunday that a government shutdown is likely unless top Democrats back down from their negotiating position, telling CBS News \"I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue.\"",
      "The shutdown blame game",
      "Democrats and Republicans have preempted the possible shutdown in recent days, seeking to put the blame on the other party should Congress fail to fund the government \u2014 forcing federal agencies to halt non-essential functions.",
      "With Republicans in the majority, Democrats have argued that they should bear responsibility for keeping the government open, and should be willing to negotiate to do so. But Republicans have insisted that there's no need, since Democrats regularly support \"clean\" continuing resolutions to keep the government funded.",
      "Thune told NBC that Democrats are using a seven-week funding resolution, designed to give lawmakers more time to work on the appropriations process, to \"try and get a whole laundry list of things that they want,\" accusing them of taking \"the federal government as a hostage.\" He added that he doesn't know \"what we're supposed to be negotiating.\"",
      "\"This is a simple, straightforward deal to keep the government running,\" the South Dakota Republican said, urging that Democrats should help keep the government funded, and then have a conversation about extending the health care subsidies.",
      "While Democrats have put the blame on Mr. Trump for a possible shutdown, Republicans have argued that any failure to fund the government will be Schumer's doing.",
      "Schumer has faced intense pressure from his party to stand up to the Trump administration and its policies in the spending fight, after he allowed Republicans to move ahead with their spending bill during the last funding dispute.",
      "After pledging to fight the GOP funding plan in March, Schumer changed course at the eleventh hour and delivered one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown. Schumer argued at the time that a shutdown risked more damage, despite intense criticism from some within his own party.",
      "But that was before Republicans in Congress approved their \"big, beautiful bill,\" which included restrictions to Medicaid that Democrats vehemently opposed, along with a rescissions package clawing back more than $9 billion in congressionally appropriated funds for foreign aid and public broadcasting. Now, Schumer's posture appears to be different as well.",

      "We will talk with the head of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Rand Paul.",
      "Plus, as the clock ticks down again towards a possible government shutdown, this round of the Washington blame game has the potential to hurt more than just the two parties. This time, the Trump administration is threatening to fire, instead of furlough, some federal workers, unless Democrats support their funding bill.",

      "We have breaking news as we begin what is likely to be another turbulent week here in Washington. Congress faces a government shutdown deadline of October 1.",
      "Our Robert Costa spoke this morning to President Trump.",
      "Bob, top leaders, both parties, both sides of the Capitol, are coming to the White House. Did the president tell you he thinks a shutdown can be avoided?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: A shutdown looks likely at this point, based on my conversation this morning with President Trump.",
      "He says both sides are at a stalemate. Democrats want to extend health care subsidies that were part of the Affordable Care Act. But President Trump said his focus on health care is on preventing undocumented migrants from having access to any of the U.S. health care system.",
      "Now, it's illegal for any noncitizen to have that sort of access. But President Trump says, we're not going to have it \u2013 quote \u2013 \"We're not going to allow it\" in terms of moving forward on any discussion unless the Democrats come to his side on health care and don't focus on the subsidies.",
      "But, based on my conversations with top Democrats, that's not going to happen. So President Trump told me \u2013 quote \u2013 \"I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue.\"",
      "That makes a shutdown quite likely. And inside the White House, sources are saying President Trump actually welcomes a shutdown, in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud, and abuse. And there is that memo, as you mentioned, that says the government is ready to have mass firings if a deal isn't struck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Reductions in force, right.",
      "Well, we also know that the president took some extraordinary public statements in the past few days. He publicly said he wants to see Adam Schiff, now a senator, Letitia James prosecuted, along with James Comey, the former FBI director, who is now indicted.",
      "Yesterday, he twice posted on social media about former FBI Director Chris Wray. Did the president tell you, is he planning prosecutions?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: I did not speak directly to the president about that today.",
      "But fishing around all weekend in his inner circle, it's clear this is just the beginning in terms of possible prosecutions of those who have scrutinized the president or criticized him over the years. You mentioned the mortgage policy potentially of Senator Adam Schiff of California. He's being discussed inside of the Trump administration.",
      "So is Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who sued the president over how he valued his real estate holdings. And there are others not even on our radar at this moment, like retired Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, who are being discussed as people who may have taken action against the administration or president in some way, allegedly, in the views of those inside, and they want to see the Justice Department hold them to account.",
      "There's such a gap right now in Washington. Republicans believe what President Trump is doing is accountability. Democrats are alarmed and see this as authoritarian government at work. And there's a real tension there that's not going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, and a justice system that has to deal with evidence and facts. And we're going to talk about all of this ahead with some of our guests.",
      "Robert Costa, thank you very much for your reporting.",
      "We want to go now to the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to start on that news you just heard that the president is basically expecting a shutdown and possibly to carry out these mass layoffs. Do you think all of this is just a threat to make Democrats fold?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, I think both sides have to look at the proposals for spending and decide, what is the best way forward for the country?",
      "The Republican proposal adds about $2 trillion in debt over the next year, so it'll be short $2 trillion. So, I oppose the Republican plan because it adds debt. The Democrat plan would add $3 trillion in debt. So, really, both plans are laden with deficit spending, and I think that's the biggest problem that our country faces.",
      "So I have actually proposed an alternative. I have proposed a penny plan, which would cut a little bit across the board, and my plan would balance over about five years. We got a vote on mine last week, and 36 Republicans supported it, 16 didn't, and no Democrats did. So my plan didn't pass either.",
      "But the plan that I would support would be a plan that reduces spending and reduces deficit spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we have this immediate deadline, though, of this week, and we know leaders are going to the White House.",
      "If we end up in this shutdown, do you think it is appropriate and legal for the executive to carry out the kind of mass firings that the budget director laid out in that memo this past week?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, there's been several cases adjudicated now all the way up to the Supreme Court, and the president seems to have won every one of them, on his ability to hire and fire within the executive branch.",
      "And I think this is understandable, because, in the executive branch, if the president can't fire them, who can? And so I think the president has a great deal of leeway over executive branch employees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Without consulting Congress?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: For hiring and firing people in the executive branch, I think he has a great deal of leeway. The court has upheld this repeatedly. And so I suspect they will.",
      "Even when Congress \u2013 the Democrats tried to protect this agency called the Consumer Financial Protection board. And they say, well, the funding will come from the Fed, you won't get to vote on the funding and the person hired can't be fired. Well, he did fire that person in 2020.",
      "And the courts upheld that in 2021 in the Supreme Court. And really, since then, every case, he has won. And, as you know, I'm equal parts critic of both Republicans and Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I have criticized Trump on things.",
      "But the one thing is on the hiring and firing. And I think he's going to win every one of those cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your role in Homeland Security. You are chairman of that oversight committee.",
      "The president announced yesterday, and I'm sure you saw his social media post, that he's going to send troops to Portland, Oregon. He called it a war-ravaged city. He said he's also going to send troops to any immigration facilities around the country which are \u2013 quote \u2013 \"under siege from attack by Antifa and other domestic terrorists\" \u2013 end quote.",
      "He said he's authorizing full force, if necessary. Do you know what full force means here? Do you know what's in store?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think he has the legal authority to send troops to protect federal buildings and federal proceedings, such as courts. And that's been around since the civil rights era. We have acknowledged that the federal government will sometimes come in, despite what states say.",
      "I do think it's better when the states agree to it, for example, I mean, in Chicago. Chicago is a nightmare. It is literally a war zone. And the people being hurt the worst are those who are poor and living in these communities. I have been to the most dangerous precinct in Chicago, and it's just despair and sadness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, but then \u2013 but you haven't been briefed on the plan for Oregon?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And these young boys have grown up with no families. There's no restaurants, no drugs.",
      "Excuse me? Say again, please.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have not been briefed on plans to send troops to Oregon?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Not for Portland, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because we have not yet seen troops in Chicago, though you're referencing the president's past threats to do so.",
      "In Oregon, the governor said there's no need and they don't want these troops. But the mayor said, the mayor of Portland, federal agents have been arriving, along with some armored vehicles. Are you comfortable with pushing the limits here of some of these uses of either potentially troops or federal agents?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think both the people in Portland and across America have to decide about this.",
      "We had anarchy in Portland for like six months or a year. The city didn't even control large swathes of the city. These had federal buildings on them. And so I think there is a role for the federal government. Am I excited about it? No, I'd prefer not to have troops in our cities, or I'd prefer them only to come with the acceptance of the local authorities.",
      "But I do think there is a role if the states will not step up. Portland did not step up, and they let their city go. They let it burn, for goodness' sakes. And then they let a whole area become the city \u2013 these blocks of anarchy, where some sort of local thug rule was going on.",
      "So, I don't know. I think, ultimately, what's going to happen \u2013 and I think some of this is the president showing the politics of Republicans versus Democrats \u2013 is, eventually, cities like Chicago and Portland are going to give up on Democrats, because their people are dying.",
      "It's their people in their community. The people who've been supporting the Democrat Party for decade after decade, they are the ones dying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's not the people in the rich neighborhoods or the country club Republican. It's poor people in every city who is dying, and the cities have to step up on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it sounded \u2013 well, I'm asking about your oversight role, because it seemed like the president's statement yesterday, it took a turn. It wasn't how he talked about Chicago.",
      "In fact, when he was speaking in this social media post about Portland, he used language here about domestic terrorists. And we know, just a few days ago, the president did issue that executive order saying he wanted to declare this anti-fascist group Antifa to be a domestic terrorist organization.",
      "Have you seen evidence that these left-wing activists are now becoming a more organized group with national leadership, something the FBI has said in the past that they're really more of an ideology?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, I think you lose the description as activists once you start wielding weapons and you show up with helmets and you're breaking windows. That's what was going on apparently in Portland at the ICE building.",
      "I do think, though, that it's important, when people start talking about labeling people, that we realize everybody, the worst among us, even those accused of heinous crimes, will get due process. So we can't single out a group and say, oh, they're not going to get due process because we're calling them terrorists.",
      "So I'd be careful of the labels, but I'm absolutely for going after the people wielding clubs and sticks and fighting with the police and trying to get into the federal buildings. They have to be punished, and they will be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you have concerns, though, about designating groups with these anti-government sentiments as domestic terrorist groups? I mean, do you start worrying about Fourth Amendment violations?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't know that it's helpful to label groups, particularly since Antifa \u2013 there are some real people in Antifa. They're real, violent people.",
      "But it is an amorphous group\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 in the sense that I don't think they have a president. They don't have a local chapter. It is more an ideology.",
      "And it was useful maybe around the world to call things terrorism, but there's different rules of engagement. When we have to go after terrorists in the Middle East, we send a Hellfire missile or a drone often. In the United States, it's much trickier to be a police \u2013 I have a great deal of respect for our police.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Because you're right. They have to respect the Fourth Amendment, the First Amendment. And so we have to be careful with labels.",
      "But it doesn't mean we should go soft on Antifa\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 and these people that are committing violence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator Rand Paul, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. She is a member of Democratic leadership. And she joins us this morning from Minneapolis.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minnesota): Thanks, Margaret. Great to be on again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we just heard from my colleague Robert Costa that the president indicated to him the likelihood of a shutdown and, with that, potentially mass firings.",
      "Do you think this is posturing or do you worry your fellow Democrats are walking into a trap?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I am glad the president has finally agreed to meet with the leadership in Congress. He canceled the meeting last week, which I think was a big mistake, because this is an opportunity for the country because of one big problem.",
      "And that is that the Republicans have created a health care crisis. My constituents, Americans, are standing on a cliff right now with these insurance premium increases that are upon them. So, Democrats are united in pushing on this and saying, look, let us do something about this crisis before it is too late, 75 percent increase in premiums starting November 1 on people who are small business owners\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 people who are farmers out there, twice as much in the rural areas.",
      "So that's what this is about to us. And the president prides himself in the art of a deal. This is the moment for him to meet with Democrats and come to an agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those premiums go up November 1. You're talking about the extension of the health care subsidies. But insurance companies plan that a year out. So these premiums are already priced in here.",
      "Why not agree to the government\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Margaret, what we know is that these tax \u2013 if I could, just\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: OK. Go ahead.",
      "The tax credits are what really could make a difference here for people. Because of the fact that we know these premiums hit November 1, getting this done now is a now thing. It's not a December thing. It's not a January thing. It's not an off-ramp. It is something we have to get done now.",
      "As one of my farmers that I met with out in rural Minnesota said, when looking at the president's tariffs and looking at what's happened in farm country, five-year high in small farm bankruptcy, he said it's a perfect storm of ugly. That's where we are with the economy right now. And that's why we are pushing on what is one of the biggest cost drivers for Americans\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 in addition to groceries and electricity prices going up. It's health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, you couldn't take the seven-week funding and then negotiate that? You're saying it has to be agreed to right now?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: We believe this is a now problem.",
      "And while we are eager to talk with Senator Thune, I know Senator Schumer is, to get this moving, in the end, we know that they are a rubber stamp for what the president wants. Not everyone's like Rand Paul going off in his own direction and talking about the debt out of the Big Beautiful Bill. I don't agree with a lot of what he says, but he's right about that debt. He's right about what happened with that bill.",
      "Most of them are just going to rubber-stamp what President Trump says. That's why it was so important to get this meeting. And I hope he sees it not\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: The president, not as political theater, but as real people who are facing a crisis right now\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 whether it's in the cities, the suburbs, or the rural areas of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sit on the Judiciary Committee, so I want to ask you about what's happening right now.",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, resigned after failing to bring a case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. We just spoke about her with Robert Costa.",
      "Monday, Lindsey Halligan was sworn in as the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. She has never prosecuted a case before. Three days into this new job, she moved forward with the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on two counts.",
      "Have you spoken to your fellow Republicans on the Judiciary Committee? Do they have concerns about what's happening in Virginia?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, I plan on doing that this week.",
      "And what I see this, as a former prosecutor myself, this is weaponizing the Justice Department, basically taking a career prosecutor who was recommended by the Republican governor of the state of Virginia, clearly has Republican roots, who made a decision based on the evidence over a period of months, made a decision.",
      "Then he's pushed out, forced out, so that the president can install his own aide into the job. When I questioned Attorney General Bondi during her confirmation hearing, she assured me that politics would not play a role, that they would make independent decisions.",
      "That is not what this is. This is a vengeance prosecution. It is not about the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You also worked on investigating January 6, 2021, and the attack of the United States Capitol.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel yesterday said publicly 274 FBI agents were \u2013 quote \u2013 \"thrown into crowd control\" on that day, against FBI standards. President Trump also said publicly that FBI agents acted as agitators who were secretly placed against all rules, regulations, protocols and standards into the crowd prior to and during the attack.",
      "This contradicts what the inspector general said in a published report that said there was no evidence of undercover employees in the crowd and that there were hundreds of special agents and employees who came in after the Capitol Hill police asked for them.",
      "This is now newly in focus because the president put the focus there. What was the role of the FBI that day?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I chaired the investigation of the security problems along a bipartisan investigation with Senator Peters and then- Senator Blunt and Senator Portman. This went on. We had a number of open hearings.",
      "And we made major, major recommendations for changes at the Capitol. And nowhere was it found that the FBI was acting as agitators. In fact, they were called in when there was such a delay in bringing in the military to insist \u2013 to assist in what was essentially an insurrection, where over 100 police officers were injured or maimed because of this criminal activity at the Capitol.",
      "So, I just find it appalling that the president would say that the FBI was somehow part of this. Kash Patel did clarify that, in fact, they were brought in after the fact. But they were brought in because we needed help. Senators, Republicans and Democrats were calling the military leaders. They were calling the attorney general. They were asking for help, because that help was not coming to the Capitol.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: And everyone has seen those facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your insight there. We will be watching what happens here, as the president tweeted both of those things and in reference to former Director Chris Wray.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thanks. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about Ukraine, which you just returned from.",
      "But, before I do that, let's button up where we left the conversation with Senator Klobuchar. FBI Director Chris Wray was twice spoken about in public statements by the president yesterday, and he said he has some explaining to do. He seemed to be connecting it to the FBI and January 6.",
      "Are you at all concerned by the former director's actions?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I do think there \u2013 with this new information, there's going to have to be some explaining as to, what is this new information and how does this relate to January 6?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, the number of the agents, the 274?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes, this does seem to be significantly different than what anyone has heard before, and how does this relate to the circumstances of what occurred there?",
      "Certainly, Kash Patel, as he's bringing this forward, this is going to be information that I think does relate. It really does go to everyone's confidence of what we currently know about that day. There's been a number of investigations, a number of people who've looked at this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: This certainly is concerning, and I think it is a matter\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What \u2013 but what part is concerning? Because that inspector general report said months ago that there were several hundred FBI agents who responded after the Capitol Police asked them to be there.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But it's the issue of, what was their role? What did they do?",
      "That aspect, I think, certainly \u2013 as we look at this information, as the FBI looks at the information, is it the same? Is it the same information that has been looked at before or is it different? And that certainly bears a review, and that, I think, will occur.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when the president says Chris Wray has some explaining to do, how do you interpret that?",
      "Because the inspector general report is public. Kash Patel said those individuals were there. It's not standard to send them, but it was disclosed they were there after the Capitol\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, as the information comes forward \u2013 I mean, obviously, the current FBI director and the FBI is going to have to come forward with the information. That information will be reviewed.",
      "And then, ultimately, the FBI is going to have to and I think that the prior director will have to explain how this information relates to what we have looked at before. And it's either going to be the same and prove that it is as everyone believed the circumstances were before, or it's going to be different.",
      "And, at that point, we're going to have to look at, how does it relate to what we believe we knew and how does it relate to what we now see?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to be\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But we don't know, because I have no information and I think no one else has any additional information, besides what the news reports are, and we will have to review what that information is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to be very clear, because it is such a dangerous information environment in so many ways, you are not in any way suggesting that the FBI was secretly agitating, which is what the president said, the attack on January 6?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I'm not suggesting anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And I don't think you are either.",
      "I think what we're both suggesting is that this currently is in news reports. And those news reports certainly bear a review of the information that's going to come forward. And that information is either going to tell us that it's the same information that has been seen before\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 or it's going to be new information. And if it's new information, that's going to need to be reviewed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, and I want to talk about your trip to Ukraine on the other side of it. But I have to do this right now.",

      "We return now to our conversation with Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Congressman, we were showing video there earlier of the overnight attack Russia carried out against Ukraine. You were just there in Kyiv. I'm sure you welcomed what the president said this week when he said he now has changed his mind and he does believe Ukraine could win this war and get its territory back from Russia. But he also added, he wishes everyone well when he made that statement. So, is he telling us that the United States is walking away from Ukraine and leaving it up to them, or is he signaling that the United States is going to help Ukraine win that territory back?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-OH): Well, we definitely need to help. And this is part of, you know, the dirty secret that really where the United States really needs to step it up. And it's part of the meeting that he had with the president of the E.U. commission.",
      "You know, the United States is providing aid to Ukraine. But at the same time, the west, and E.U. and the United States is subsidizing Russia and its production machine because, you know, we're buying from China and India that is buying energy from Russia. And the E.U. is buying energy from Russia.",
      "So, we need to place sanctions on Russia so that we're not funding their economy, which is funding their ability to attack and kill Ukraine. So, we're funding both sides of this.",
      "Unfortunately, there are those in Congress that want to stop supporting Ukraine's ability to defend themselves. Well, that will just result in more attacks from Russia as we saw last night against Ukraine. That's not going to get us to peace. The only way to get us to peace, and \u2013 and Trump's vision of peace, is to impact their ability for production, to stop subsidizing Russia's economy and their ability for production and killing Ukrainians, and that's to adopt Lindsey Graham and Brian Fitzpatrick's bill that would impose sanctions. Give the president the ability to impact Russia's ability to wage this war and get us to peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Speaker Johnson has said before that he would put that bill to a vote. He just hasn't. And he said, oh, I need the \u2013 the president to green light it. That's not true. We has a veto-proof majority. We've had Senator Graham on this program a million times telling us this is set to go, just give us the green light.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did Speaker Johnson respond to your request to move?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No. And he's \u2013 and the momentum is here. We need to do this now. The president doesn't need to give us the green light. He's not a red light. The last time that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, leadership is not acting on it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And we \u2013 and we're coming back. And we need to do so. And we need to do so now. The last time we put on the floor the \u2013 the bill that would have stopped funding Ukraine, there were 3,000 \u2013 300 members voted for it. And if we put the bill on the floor to stop \u2013 to put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their economy, it would be similar. Over 300 members would vote for it.",
      "The only way to peace is to put sanctions on Russia, continue our support for Ukraine, which is what we're doing, what the president's going to be doing, and \u2013 and bring this war to an end. Support Trump's vision of peace, put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their \u2013 their war economy.",
      "Now what I saw in Ukraine, which is what's really incredible, is that they are winning modern warfare. What they're doing with their anti-drone technology, I mean, they are really the tech bros of the future. They are implementing on the front line anti-drone air defense technology that is winning this war. With our help and assistance, which they're going to continue to need for the long-range systems that Russia is bringing in and that are attacking Kyiv with. But with their anti-drone technology that no one else has, that they are implementing, they are winning this war. We need to be on the side of \u2013 of \u2013 that war of the future that they're winning and support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I've heard military officials explain this to \u2013 to me, that this is like a really interesting test case to learn the lessons that Ukraine is \u2013 is illustrating for the world. However, in \u2013 in the immediate term, will the president lift restrictions on Ukraine's ability to use long-range weapons to actually attack Russia?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, and he really needs to do so. Because what's happening with that pressure that's on the front lines \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because he has the old Biden policy.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right. Well, he does. And that's what he needs to release. Because with the pressure on the front line, and the fact that Ukraine has developed anti-drone technology, where they're taking down Russian drones, they're using their own drones to attack Russia. But Russia has long-range weapons that they're attacking that front line.",
      "Ukraine needs to have the ability to use long-range weapons to push Russia back. And when they're able to do that, they will get their territory back. If they are able to do that, they will win this war. And if we put sanctions on Russia impacting their ability to produce their war machine and production, they will be able to win this modern warfare and we'll be on the right side of what \u2013 this is not old time war. This is modern war. And we're being (ph) on the right side of Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've just got to persuade President Trump to do that, that change in policy.",
      "When we were in France last week, speaking to President Macron, I asked him about those incursions into European air space. Some would say by Russian drones or Russian jets. Others have said they still need to investigate. We've seen drones or jets into Poland, Estonia, Romania, Norway, possibly Denmark. What should the United States be doing to push back on those provocations?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: You know, what's interesting about this is \u2013 what we've also said that is that, you know, Russia, once they get through Ukraine, would be testing and going \u2013 continue into Europe. But what they're seeing \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that what they're doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But what they're seeing now, because they're having this \u2013 this success of Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine. They're now going into Poland and Romania and they're seeing that Poland and Romania don't have the advanced technology that Ukraine does. And instead of going through Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine. Since \u2013 since this is modern warfare and Ukraine's winning it, they're seeing that the old war is actually old Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike Turner, thank you for sharing some of your insights which you learned on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back in a moment. So, stay us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who joins us this morning from Richmond.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-VA): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have, what, 140,000 federal civilian workers in your state. One of the highest numbers in the nation. How concerned are you that you will see mass layoffs if we go into this shutdown that the White House says they are preparing for?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, and I think your reporter Robert Costa said they're even welcoming it. We are really worried about it, Margaret. When - - when Ted Cruz forced a shutdown of the government in October 2013, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And when Donald Trump forced a shutdown of the government in late 2018, early 2019, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And this one would be the same.",
      "The only thing about the president's threat to fire more people is, he's already doing it. And instead of threatening, he should just be meeting to negotiate.",
      "We came near shutdown deadlines during the Biden administration, but we never shut government down because the president would sit down with congressional leaders of both parties and would find a path forward. And that's what we've been asking for since the Democrats put an alternate plan on the table on September 18th, just sit down and talk with us. And, finally, he has agreed to do that tomorrow. But if you're reporting is to be believed, he's sort of going into it setting \u2013 reducing expectations improperly. He should be doing what presidents do and saying we're going to find a deal to keep the government of the greatest nation on earth open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it enough of a deal to say, take the short-term seven-week funding deal and we'll continue to talk about these health care subsidies that Democrats say they are so concerned about? I mean is it really worth the risk?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Here's \u2013 here's my thought about this, Margaret. This - - my personal view. We've got to solve this health care issue, and Republicans are saying the same thing. Mike Johnson has said it. Senator Cornyn has said it. Senator Hawley has said it. Senator Murkowski has said it. We're asking to fix a problem that even Republicans want to fix.",
      "I don't think we have to have every detail pinned down with all the i's dotted and t's crossed in order to do a short-term extension. But I do want to see that Republicans are saying, you're right, we can fix this, and here's the path to finding a fix.",
      "And the second thing we need, which is so reasonable, we're just asking, if we do a deal, please don't, Mr. President, sign the deal and then immediately the next day start \u2013 starting to take away funds, rescinding agreements that you just made yesterday. A deal should be a deal. And we should all agree that Americans should not see their health care suffer, their premiums spike, and people lose insurance and providers close.",
      "We've already had providers in Virginia announce that they are closing their doors because of the bill that the Republicans passed in July. And this is happening all over the country. Let's just do what's right by our constituents and fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you another question specific to Virginia, and that is what is going on inside the judicial system. Back in August it was the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, Todd Gilbert, who suddenly resigned. Then, earlier this month, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Eric Siebert, resigned after failing to bring a case against New York's Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "What is going on here in the Virginia court system?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, I \u2013 it's pretty darn plain. The president nominated two U.S. attorneys in Virginia, both with Republican bona fides. Todd Gilbert, in the western district, had been the Republican speaker of our house of delegates. He resigned as a legislator to take the Trump appointment. President Trump's team interviewed these candidates, approved the candidates, nominated the candidates, and then even appointed them into the interim position. But both were forced out because they said their integrity as prosecutors would not allow them to genuflect to Donald Trump.",
      "In Todd Gilbert's case they wanted to force him to demote a long time career member of the Western District of Virginia, who had served under multiple administrations and presidents. He refused to do so. And in Eric Siebert's case, he refused to bring a criminal charge against a perceived Trump political opponent when there was no evidence to support the charge.",
      "President Trump spending time going after enemies, trying to figure out a way to give $20 billion to a friend, the Argentine government, instead of dealing with the challenges we elected him to confront. Food prices are going up. Building supplies are going up. School supplies are going up. And energy costs are going up. Health care costs are going up. And Donald Trump seems to be focused on a retribution campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: You got to focus, man. This is an important job. It's time to focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when it comes to those Virginia cases, have you talked to Siebert, have you talked to Gilbert to understand why they felt they had to resign?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I have talked to each of them after the resignations were done. These were individuals \u2013 I knew both \u2013 I knew Todd Gilbert because of his legislative role and I knew Eric Siebert very well by reputation. And again, this was the prosecutor, Margaret, who, when the Biden administration transitioned to the Trump administration, the Trump administration DOJ put him in the role as an interim even before we recommended him, along with our Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, as you mentioned.",
      "So, after they had been fired, yes, I did call and say I'd like to understand why you were forced out. And they shared thoughts with me without getting into anything about particular cases or particular communication they'd had with Trump administration officials.",
      "But I am convinced, and Virginians are convinced \u2013 I traveled around the state this week, people are talking about this. Both of these individuals had a backbone. They wouldn't genuflect to Donald Trump and they wouldn't bring baseless cases. And we shouldn't see that in any district in this nation. And it's sad that President Trump is more focused on retribution than serving his constituents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that eastern district did come forward with this indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Yes, it was just a two-page indictment. No evidence presented publicly here. But it was convincing enough to 14 of 23 people sitting on a grand jury. Can you really say there's no there there?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: A bare \u2013 a \u2013 well, a bare majority, as you know, Margaret, there's 23 people on a grand jury. They need at least 12 votes to get an indictment. And, yes, they got their finger over the bar with 14. Although the 23 wouldn't agree on one of the charges that the U.S. attorney was pushing. So, we will see what this case is about.",
      "It is odd that the indictment has so few facts. And I found it very odd. I used to practice in this court. And when the attorney general put out a press statement after the indictment and said, we will follow the facts in this case. What? Prosecutors follow the facts before they indict.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: They don't indict and then say, well, let's see what the facts are. I think she even revealed that this is a weak case, which everyone in her office was telling her it was a weak case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 on your Armed Services role I want to quickly ask you. You have said you are supportive of the creation of a Palestinian state.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we saw at the U.N. this past week a large number of members just simply walked out when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke. It was a statement. Tomorrow, he's going to be at the White House. Ahead of that meeting, President Trump said this.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There's been enough. It's time to stop now. OK?",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a strong statement. Do you know how the United States should enforce that? How do you force Israel to step back from annexation?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, I was very heartened that the president said that. And \u2013 and you're right, I support what the United States voted for in the U.N. in 1947, a state of Israel and a state of Palestine. One of those promises has been met. One hasn't. And we need to be on a path for a Palestinian state that's demilitarized where Hamas plays no role in its governance. And until we find that path forward, we're going to have continued cycles of violence that are bad for Israelis, bad for Palestinians, bad for the region.",
      "So, I hope the president, who by all accounts has a strong relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, makes plain that we are \u2013 we are against annexation and this 21-point proposal that the president has on the table, which is pretty similar to the New York dialogue being led by the French and the Saudis, they're \u2013 they're different efforts, but they're trying to reach the same point, a future state for Israel and Palestine where both can live in peace and creating stability in the region instead of the cycles of violence.",
      "So, I hope the president leans into that at the meeting tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I was heartened by his comment. It would be a big mistake for the prime minister, Netanahu, to look at all of the nations that have been allies saying you need to change course and for him to just pull his head in the shell and turn inward and continue to isolate Israel rather than move forward toward peace and more stability in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kaine, thank you for your insights today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ty Cobb. He served as White House special counsel for just under a year during the first Trump administration, helping to coordinate the response to Robert Mueller's probe of Russian influence on the 2016 election.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "TY COBB (Former White House Special Counsel to the President): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw this action against former FBI Director James Comey this past week and he was indicted on two charges specific to his September 2020 testimony to Congress about Russian election meddling in 2016. The so-called crossfire hurricane.",
      "In your view, from what you've heard of this case, do you think it has enough substance to actually head to trial?",
      "TY COBB: I don't really. You know, as you and Senator Kaine discussed briefly moments ago, that the grand jury rejected one of the counts, the top count actually in the indictment, approved two, but by a very slim margin, 14 out of 23, in a process where there's no defense attorney in the room and the standard is merely probable cause. You know, the next courtroom that this will be assessed in, if it gets to trial, requires unanimity from 12 people, and \u2013 and there will be a vigorous defense. I don't see any way in the world that, you know, Comey would be convicted. And I think there's a good chance because of, you know, the wholly unconstitutional authoritarian way that this was done that the case may get tossed out well before trial.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wholly unconstitutional and authoritarian. That's \u2013 that's quite a description. You used to work for President Trump. What makes you now characterize his actions that way?",
      "TY COBB: That's true. I used to work \u2013 well, I used to work at the White House as \u2013 as a lawyer, you know, interacting with the Justice Department in the Mueller investigation and other matters. And I was not Trump's personal lawyer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "TY COBB: So, my role was really, you know, as a \u2013 as a government employee and not personal to the \u2013 to the president. He did have personal lawyers.",
      "But, you know, at the time, you know, I was trying to perform the duties that were assigned to me. In this \u2013 in this circumstance, you know, I'm eight years removed from that. I don't \u2013 I don't have any allegiances or reasons to, you know, say anything other than balls and strikes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TY COBB: And, you know, former Attorney General Jackson, Justice Jackson, Nuremberg prosecutor, himself highlighted in 1940 that the most important thing at the Justice Department, when he was attorney general, was that people not target individuals. That they merely pursue crimes. Griffin Bell, you know, years later, 1978, you know, said essentially the same thing, emphasized how, you know, political \u2013 politics and, you know, favor have no business at the Justice Department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TY COBB: It's all about even handedness. And I think we talked about the misrepresentations that Attorney General Bondi made about how she would proceed evenhandedly and, you know, she's wholly abandoned that now and is now merely doing the president's bidding when he says prosecute my enemies now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, \"The New York Times\" is reporting that half a dozen U.S. attorneys' offices have been ordered to draft plans to investigate a group funded by George Soros, who is a Democratic donor. You look at that, you look at the lists of names of others who the president has said he specifically wants to be prosecuted or investigated. I'll read a few of them to you. Two former Trump officials, Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor. He also said he wants a federal investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith. The DOJ fired the 35 lawyers who were involved in the January 6th and classified documents cases. The Justice Department is now going after Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis' travel records. We have quite an exhaustive list here. What is the pattern you see?",
      "TY COBB: Well, I think if you go to 30,000 feet, what you see is a lot of moving parts, but simple themes. The simple themes are rewriting history. Trump wants to rewrite history so that, you know, the next generation may not know that he incited a violent insurrection, refused to peacefully transfer the power of the presidency after losing an election, stole classified documents and showed them to, you know, friends and guests at Mar-a-Lago. You know, and that \u2013 that he was a criminal. I mean, he's a convicted felon. All \u2013 all anybody involved in those events that offended him, they're in \u2013 they're in real danger.",
      "So, you have the rewriting of history stuff. You know, the U.S. attorney that he appointed his personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, you know, her \u2013 her role previously in the administration was, you know, trying to eliminate the theory that, you know, America, you know, had slaves at the Smithsonian.

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 05:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Under a new law, many Americans will have to meet a work requirement to obtain and keep their Medicaid coverage. But due to an exemption, millions living in areas of high unemployment could be spared.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Medicaid enrollees may have a way out of the new federal work requirement \u2014 if they live in a county with high unemployment.",
      "By January 2027, President Trump's far-reaching domestic policy law will require many adult, nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 42 states and Washington, D.C., to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or go to school.",
      "But under the law, Medicaid enrollees in counties where unemployment is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate could be shielded from the work requirement, if their state applies for an exemption.",
      "A new analysis by KFF shows that exemption in the GOP's work requirement could offer a reprieve to potentially millions of Americans caught in a tough spot \u2014 needing to work to secure health insurance but having trouble finding a job.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office projected the work requirement would apply to 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees, causing about 5.3 million to lose their government health coverage by 2034. CBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma confirmed to KFF Health News that analysts factored the unemployment rate exemption into their projections. Only states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act or a special waiver must enact a work requirement, under the federal law.",
      "But how many people could be exempt depends on how the Trump administration interprets the law, in addition to whether their states' officials apply.",
      "For example, if Trump officials exempt people in counties where the unemployment rate has been above the law's thresholds for any month over a 12-month period, about 4.6 million Medicaid enrollees in 386 counties could qualify for an exemption today based on the latest unemployment data, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That amounts to just under a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees subject to the work requirement.",
      "Under that one-month threshold, \"the impact could be fairly significant,\" said Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the analysis and the deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.",
      "But, she said, the Trump administration is more likely to adopt a stricter threshold based on average unemployment over a 12-month period. That would align with work requirements under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food assistance commonly known as food stamps.",
      "Only about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees living in 158 counties could be exempted under that standard, or about 7% of the total subject to work requirements, KFF found. That's about 7% of enrollees who live in expansion states who would otherwise need to meet the new requirement.",
      "Based on the 12-month criteria, about 90% of Medicaid enrollees who could be exempted based on high unemployment reside in five states, according to KFF: California, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. California alone accounts for over half of those who could be exempted.",
      "The unemployment rate exemption is one of several carve-outs from the Medicaid work requirement in the GOP's law. The law also exempts parents with children under 14, people who are disabled or frail, and those who are pregnant, incarcerated, or in a substance use disorder program, among others. The high unemployment provision is different than most because it exempts people living in entire counties.",
      "Two top Republicans key to the bill's passage \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "To qualify for the Medicaid exemption, states would have to apply to the federal government on behalf of individuals in eligible counties. And if a county earned an exemption, the government would determine how long it applies.",
      "Even if the federal government grants exemptions broadly, health advocates fear some Republican-led states could balk at applying for exemptions in order to keep enrollment down, as they say has been the case with SNAP exemptions. As of 2023, 18 states did not have an exemption under the SNAP program, even though some of their residents might be eligible.",
      "\"It's not a guarantee that people can rely on,\" said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group that intends to push for the broadest possible exemptions to help people maintain their coverage. Eastern Kentucky has several counties with perennially high unemployment.",
      "In advocating for Mr. Trump's bill, many Republicans in Washington argued that most people who gained Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act should be working to get off of government assistance.",
      "But as Georgia's and Arkansas' experiences have shown, Medicaid work requirements can be costly for states to run and frustrating for enrollees to navigate. About 18,000 people in Arkansas, or nearly a quarter of the state's adults who gained Medicaid coverage through the ACA expansion, lost coverage when the state had a work requirement in 2018 and 2019. A court ended the state's work requirement program.",
      "Critics point out that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a disability or caregiving responsibilities, and they argue the reporting requirements merely serve as a bureaucratic hurdle to obtaining and keeping coverage. Under the GOP law, enrollees' work status needs to be verified at least twice a year.",
      "Most of the coverage losses due to work requirements occur among people who work or should qualify for an exemption but nevertheless lose coverage due to red tape, research shows.",
      "Not every state must implement a work requirement under Mr. Trump's law, only those that chose to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people through the ACA or a federal waiver. The ACA has provided hundreds of billions in federal dollars to help states cover everyone making up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 $21,597 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Forty states and Washington, D.C., took up the expansion. Georgia and Wisconsin partly expanded their Medicaid eligibility by getting a federal waiver, adding them to the list of states subject to the work requirement. These two states were not included in the KFF analysis because of a lack of county-level enrollment data.",
      "Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said she is pleased the law makes some exceptions for places where jobs are scarce. It could limit how many people lose coverage because of the work requirement, she said.",
      "Wagner said SNAP's unemployment rate exemption has helped millions of people avoid losing their food assistance, but its impact also depends on whether a state seeks the waiver.",
      "She is concerned the Trump administration may make it difficult for counties to get exempted under the Medicaid law.",
      "\"I'm glad it's in there as it will certainly help people, but it's still a terrible bill,\" she said. \"This will not really blunt the harm of the bill.\"",

      "Nancy Larson, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said a collection of notes found at Joshua Jahn's residence showed an animus toward ICE agents and that he had been planning the attack for some time. Jahn legally purchased the 8mm bolt-action rifle used in the shooting last month, officials said.",

      "On Saturday, Sept. 27, the man fatally shot was identified as 37-year-old Norlan Guzman-Fuentes by the Dallas Medical Examiner.\u00a0 The two injured men have been identified by ICE as Jose Andres Bordones-Molina and Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez.",

    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "Missouri has joined Texas and California in redrawing its congressional maps, as part of a redistricting push that could lead to Republicans drawing themselves as many as six extra House seats while Democrats' efforts could help them pick up five.",
      "The redistricting gambit began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats.",
      "Then, in Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map earlier this month to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, signed the legislation on Sunday.",
      "Challenges remain for the maps in all three states. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create the new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Civil rights groups are also suing in Texas, claiming the maps are racially biased. And in California, the state's new map must be approved by voters in a November special election before it takes effect.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, includingIndiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",

The president's comments appeared to come in response to a report Thursday from right-leaning media.",
      "\"That's right, as it now turns out, FBI Agents were at, and in, the January 6th Protest, probably acting as Agitators and Insurrectionists, but certainly not as 'Law Enforcement Officials,'\" Mr. Trump said.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. We have breaking news as we begin what is likely to be another turbulent week here in Washington. Congress faces a government shutdown deadline of October 1. Our Robert Costa spoke this morning to President Trump. Bob, top leaders, both parties, both sides of the Capitol, are coming to the White House. Did the President tell you he thinks a shutdown can be avoided?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: A shutdown looks likely at this point based on my conversation this morning with President Trump. He says both sides are at a stalemate. Democrats want to extend health care subsidies that were part of the Affordable Care Act, but President Trump said his focus on health care is on preventing undocumented migrants from having access to any of the U.S. health care system. Now, it's illegal for any non-citizen to have that sort of access, but President Trump says we're not going to have it. Quote, we're not going to allow it, in terms of moving forward on any discussion, unless the Democrats come to his side on health care and don't focus on the subsidies. But based on my conversations with top Democrats, that's not going to happen. So President Trump told me quote, I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue. That makes a shutdown quite likely. And inside the White House, sources are saying President Trump actually welcomes a shutdown in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud and abuse. And there is that memo, as you mentioned, that says the government is ready to have mass firings if a deal isn't struck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Reductions in force, right. Well, we also know that the President took some extraordinary public statements in the past few days. He publicly said he wants to see Adam Schiff, now a senator, Letitia James prosecuted along with James Comey, the former FBI director who is now indicted. Yesterday, he twice posted on social media about former FBI Director Chris Wray. Did the President tell you, is he planning prosecutions?",
      "COSTA: I did not speak directly to the president about that today. But fishing around all weekend in his inner circle, it's clear, this is just the beginning in terms of possible prosecutions of those who have scrutinized the president or criticized him over the years. You mentioned the mortgage policy, potentially, of Senator Adam Schiff of California. He's being discussed inside of the Trump administration. So is Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, who sued the president over how he valued his real estate holdings. And there are others not even on our radar at this moment, like retired Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, who are being discussed as people who have, may have taken action against the administration or president in some way, allegedly, in the views of those inside. And they want to see the Justice Department hold them to account. There's such a gap right now in Washington. Republicans believe what President Trump is doing is accountability. Democrats are alarmed and see this as authoritarian government at work. And there's a real tension there that's not going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And a justice system that has to deal with evidence and facts.",
      "And we're going to talk about all of this ahead with some of our guests. Robert Costa, thank you very much for your reporting."

      "\"At the request of Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, I am directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists. I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said U.S. military personnel stand ready to mobilize in support of Department of Homeland Security operations in Portland at Mr. Trump's direction.",
      "\"The Department will provide information and updates as they become available,\" Parnell said.",
      "No other information regarding the size or the timing of the deployment of troops has been released. CBS News has reached out to the U.S. Northern Command and the National Guard Bureau for more details.",
      "Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek told reporters at a news conference Saturday that she has spoken with Mr. Trump and Noem and said, \"Our city is a far cry from the war-ravaged community he has posted on social media and I conveyed that directly to him.\" She also said the president told her: \"Let's keep talking.\"",
      "\"There is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security and there is no need for military troops in our major city,\" Kotek said. \"Military service members should be dedicated to real emergencies.\"",
      "Since the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the president has escalated his efforts to confront what he calls the \"radical left,\" which he blames for the country's problems with political violence.",
      "He deployed the National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in the District of Columbia.",
      "The ICE facility in Portland has been the target of frequent demonstrations, sometimes leading to violent clashes. Some federal agents have been injured and several protesters have been charged with assault. When protesters erected a guillotine earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security described it as \"unhinged behavior.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, in comments Thursday in the Oval Office, suggested some kind of operation was in the works.",
      "\"We're going to get out there and we're going to do a pretty big number on those people in Portland,\" he said, describing them as \"professional agitators and anarchists.\"",
      "On Saturday, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson responded to Mr. Trump, saying that the \"number of necessary troops is zero, in Portland and any other American city.\"",
      "\"Our nation has a long memory for acts of oppression, and the president will not find lawlessness or violence here unless he plans to perpetrate it. Imagine if the federal government sent hundreds of engineers, or teachers, or outreach workers to Portland, instead of a short, expensive, and fruitless show of force,\" Wilson said.",
      "Both Democratic senators representing Oregon on Saturday criticized the president's plans as \"authoritarian,\" saying Portland is a peaceful city.",
      "\"Trump is sending troops to Portland with the goal of 'doing a number' on the city. We know what this means. He wants to stoke fear and chaos and trigger violent interactions and riots to justify expanded authoritarian control,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley said in a video posted to social media. \"Let's not take the bait.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden wrote, \"Trump is launching an authoritarian takeover of Portland hoping to provoke conflict in my hometown.\"",
      "\"I urge Oregonians to reject Trump's attempt to incite violence in what we know is a vibrant and peaceful city. I will do everything in my power to protect the people in our state,\" Wyden said on X.",
      "Wyden later Saturday posted a video to X that he said was just taken outside an ICE facility in Portland, and showed no protesters.",
      "\"Taken just a few minutes ago outside the ICE facility in Portland that Trump claims is under siege,\" Wyden wrote. \"My message to Donald Trump is this: we don't need you here. Stay the hell out of our city.\"",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who appeared on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, said he thinks \"there is a role for the federal government,\" noting that the federal government will sometimes intervene \"despite what states say.\"",
      "\"Am I excited about it? No, I'd prefer not to have troops in our cities,\" Paul said. \"Or I'd prefer them only to come, you know, with the acceptance of the local authorities. But I do think there is a role if the states will not step up, Portland did not step up.\"",
      "Earlier in September, Mr. Trump had described living in Portland as \"like living in hell\" and said he was considering sending in federal troops, as he has recently threatened to do to combat crime in other cities, including Chicago and Baltimore.",
      "At the joint news conference with Gov. Kotek on Saturday, Portland Mayor Wilson said that he will sign a joint statement modeled after the one signed by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who last month signed an executive order against possible deployment of federal agents in his city.",
      "Memphis, Tennessee, has also been bracing for a potential influx of National Guard troops, and on Friday Republican Gov. Bill Lee said they will be part of a surge of resources to fight crime in the city. The governor said troops are set to arrive next week.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Ty Cobb, who served as White House Special Counsel during President Trump's first term, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ty Cobb. He served as White House Special Counsel for just under a year during the first Trump administration, helping to coordinate the response to Robert Mueller's probe of Russian influence on the 2016 election. Good morning to you.",
      "FORMER WHITE HOUSE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT TY COBB: Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw this action against former FBI Director James Comey this past week, and he was indicted on two charges specific to his September 2020 testimony to Congress about Russian election meddling in 2016, so-called Crossfire Hurricane. In your view, from what you've heard of this case, do you think it has enough substance to actually head to trial?",
      "COBB: I don't, really. You know, as you and Senator Kaine discussed briefly, moments ago, that the grand jury rejected one of the counts, the top count, actually, in the indictment, approved two, but by a very slim margin, 14 out of 23 in a process where there's no defense attorney in the room, and the standard is merely probable cause. The next courtroom that this will be assessed in, if it gets to trial, requires unanimity from 12 people, and there will be a vigorous defense. I don't see any way in the world that, you know, Comey will be convicted. And I think there's a good chance, because of, you know, the wholly unconstitutional, authoritarian way that this was done, that the case may get tossed out well before trial.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wholly unconstitutional and authoritarian. That's- that's quite a description. You used to work for President Trump. What makes you now characterized his actions that way?",
      "COBB: I used to work- well, I used to work at the White House as as a lawyer, you know, interacting with the Justice Department in the Mueller investigation and other matters, and I was not Trump's personal lawyer. So, my role was really, you know, as a- as a government employee, and not personal to the- to the president. He did have personal lawyers, but, you know, at the time, you know, I was trying to perform the duties that were assigned to me. In this- in this circumstance, you know, I'm eight years removed from that. I don't- I don't have any allegiances or reasons to, you know, say anything other than balls and strikes. And former Attorney General Jackson, Justice Jackson, Nuremberg Prosecutor, himself, highlighted in 1940 that the most important thing at the Justice Department when he was Attorney General was that people not target individuals, that they merely pursue crimes. Griffin Bell, years later, 1978 said essentially the same thing. Emphasized how political- politics and favor have no business at the Justice Department. It's all about even-handedness. And I think we talked about the misrepresentations that Attorney General Bondi made about how she would proceed even-handedly, and, you know, she's wholly abandoned that and is now merely doing the President's bidding when he says, prosecute my enemies, now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Well, the New York Times is reporting that half a dozen US Attorney's Offices have been ordered to draft plans to investigate a group funded by George Soros, who is a democratic donor. You look at that, you look at the list of names of others who the President has said he specifically wants to be prosecuted or investigated. I'll read a few of them to you: Two former Trump officials, Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor. He also said he wants a federal investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith, the DOJ fired the 35 lawyers who were involved in the January 6th and classified documents cases. The Justice Department is now going after Fulton County DA Fani Willis' travel records. We have quite an exhaustive list here. What is the pattern you see?",
      "COBB: Well, I think if you go to 30,000 feet, what you see is a lot of moving parts, but simple themes. The simple themes are rewriting history. Trump wants to rewrite history so that, you know, the next generation may not know that he incited a violent insurrection, refused to peacefully transfer the power of the presidency after losing an election, stole classified documents and showed them to friends and- and guests at Mar-a-Lago, you know, and that he was a criminal. I mean, he's a convicted felon. All- all anybody involved in those events that offended him, they're- they're in real danger. So, you have the rewriting history stuff. You know, the US attorney that he appointed, his personal lawyer, Lindsay Halligan. You know her, her role previously in the administration was, you know, trying to eliminate the theory that, you know, America had slaves at the Smithsonian. She was there to, you know, whitewash the- the Smithsonian and paint America- paint America is something that- that it isn't. I mean, America needs to learn from the mistakes and lessons that we've had, and one of the biggest mistakes that- that America ever had was re-electing President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a number of Republican lawmakers are declining to speak out and are leaving the door open that these cases are legitimate. Do you think that the judicial system can resist what you are saying here as just simply politically motivated pressure?",
      "COBB: I think that's an excellent question. I think, you know, the founders, when they- when they drafted the Constitution, Article One is to Congress, and Congress has the greatest powers under the Constitution; spending power, war power, impeachment. Congress is really there to check the presidency. Congress has been neutered by the cowardice of the Republicans. Mike Johnson won't even seat recently elected representative Grijalva because he doesn't want her to tip the balance on the- on the Epstein vote. Congress is totally in the tank and --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, I'm gonna have to cut you off. I'm sorry, because we're out of time there. Ty Cobb, thank you for your time. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Good morning. Good to have you here in person.",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thanks. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about Ukraine, which you just returned from, but before I do that, let's button up where we left the conversation with Senator Klobuchar. FBI Director Chris Wray was twice spoken about in public statements by the President yesterday, and he said he has some explaining to do. He seemed to be connecting it to the FBI and January 6th. Are you at all concerned by the former director's actions?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I do think that there- you know, with this new information, there's going to have to be some explaining as to what 6th- what is this new information, and how does this relate to January?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, the number of the agents? That 274 --",
      "REP. TURNER: Yes. This does seem to be significantly different than what anyone has heard before, and how does this relate to the circumstances of what occurred there. Certainly, Kash Patel, as he's bringing this forward, this is going to be information that I think does relate. It really does go to everyone's confidence of what we currently know about that day. There's been a number of investigations, and a number of people who've looked at this. You know, this certainly is concerning. And I think you know it is better --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what part is concerning, because that inspector general report said months ago that there were several 100 FBI agents who responded after the Capitol Police asked him to be there?",
      "REP. TURNER: But it's the issue of, you know, what was- what- what was their role? What did they do? You know, that aspect, I think certainly. As we look at this information, as the FBI looks at the information, is it the same? Is it the same information that has been looked at before, or is it different? And that certainly bears review, and that, I think, will occur.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when the President says Chris Wray has some explaining to do, how do you interpret that? Because the Inspector General report is public. Kash Patel said those individuals were there. It's not standard to send them, but it was disclosed they were there at the Capitol.",
      "REP. TURNER: I mean, obviously, the current FBI Director, and the FBI is going to have to come forward with the information. That information will be reviewed, and then, ultimately, the FBI is going to have to- and I think that the prior director will have to explain how this information relates to what we've looked at before. And it's either going to be the same and prove that it is as everyone believed the circumstances were before, or it's going to be different. And, at that point, we're going to have to look at, you know, how does it relate to what we believe we knew, and how does it relate to what we now see, what we don't know. Because I have no information, I think no one else has any additional information besides what the news reports are, and we'll have to review what that information is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to be very clear, because it is such a dangerous information environment in so many ways, you are not in any way suggesting that the FBI was secretly agitating, which is what the president said the attack on January 6th?",
      "REP. TURNER: I'm not suggesting anything, and I don't think you are either. I think what we're both suggesting is that this currently is in news reports, and those news reports certainly bear a review of the information that's going to come forward, and that information is either going to tell us that it's the same information that has been seen before, or it's going to be new information. And if it's new information that's going to need to be reviewed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, and I want to talk about your trip to Ukraine on the other side of it, but I have to do this right now. So stay with us, all of you.",
      "((COMMERCIAL BREAK))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return now to our conversation with Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Congressman, we were showing video there earlier of the overnight attack Russia carried out against Ukraine. You were just there, in Kyiv. I'm sure you welcomed what the President said this week, when he said he now has changed his mind, and he does believe Ukraine could win this war and get its territory back from Russia. But he also added he wishes everyone well when he made that statement. So is he telling us that the United States is walking away from Ukraine and leaving it up to them, or is he signaling that the United States is going to help Ukraine win that territory back?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, we definitely need to help. And this is part of the dirty secret that really where the United States really needs to step it up, and it's part of the meeting that he had with the president of the EU Commission. You know, the United States is providing aid to Ukraine. But, at the same time, the West, the EU, and the United States is subsidizing Russia and its production machine, because, you know, we're buying from China and India that is buying energy from Russia, and the EU is buying energy from Russia. So we need to place sanctions on Russia so that we're not funding their economy, which is funding their ability to attack and kill Ukraine. So we're funding both sides of this. Unfortunate- unfortunately, there are those in Congress that want to stop supporting Ukraine's ability to defend themselves. Well, that'll just result in more attacks from Russia, as we saw last night, against Ukraine. That's not going to get us to peace. The only way to get us to peace, and Trump's vision of peace, is to impact their ability for production, to stop subsidizing Russia's economy and their ability for production and killing Ukrainians, and that's to adopt Lindsey Graham and Brian Fitzpatrick's bill that would impose sanctions. Give the President the ability to impact Russia's ability to wage this war and get us to peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Speaker Johnson has said before that he would put that bill to a vote, he just hasn't. And he has said, oh, I need the president to green light it. That's not true. He has a veto-proof majority. We've had Senator Graham on this program a million times telling us this is set to go, just give us the green light. Did Speaker Johnson respond to your request to move?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, and he's- the momentum is here, we need to do this now. The President doesn't need to give us a green light. He's not a red light. The last time that- and we and we're coming back, and we need to do so, we need to do so now. The last time we put on the floor the bill that would have stopped funding Ukraine, over 300 members voted for it. If we put the bill on the floor to stop the- to put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their economy, it would be similar. Over 300 members would vote for it. The only way to peace is to put sanctions on Russia, continue our support for Ukraine, which is what we're doing, what the President is going to be doing, and bring this war to an end. Support Trump's vision of peace. Put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their- their war economy. Now, what I saw in Ukraine, which is what's really incredible, is that they are winning modern warfare. What they're doing with their anti-drone technology, I mean, they are really the tech bros of the future. They are implementing on the front line, anti-drone air defense technology that is winning this war with our help and assistance, which they're going to continue to need for the long-range systems that Russia is bringing in and that are attacking Kyiv with. But what their anti-drone technology that no one else has, that they are implementing. They are winning this war. We need to be on the side of that war of the future that they're winning and support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I've heard military officials explain this to me that this is like a really interesting test case to learn the lessons that Ukraine is illustrating for the world. However, in the immediate term, will the President lift restrictions on Ukraine's ability to use long-range weapons to actually attack Russia?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, and he really needs to do so, because what's happening with that pressure that's on the front line \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he has the old Biden policy.",
      "REP. TURNER: Right, well, he does, and that's what he needs to release, because with the pressure on the front line and the fact that Ukraine has developed anti-drone technology, where they're taking down Russian drones, they're using their own drones to attack Russia, but Russia has long-range weapons that they're attacking that front line. Ukraine needs to have the ability to use long-range weapons to push Russia back. And when they're able to do that, they will get their territory back. If they are able to do that, they will win this war. And if we put sanctions on Russia, impacting their ability to produce their war machine and production, they will be able to win this modern warfare, and will be on the right side of what- this is not old-time war. This is modern war, and we're being on the right side of Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've just got to persuade President Trump to do that- that change in policy. When we were in France last week speaking to President Macron, I asked him about those incursions into European airspace, some would say by Russian drones or Russian jets, others have said they still need to investigate. We've seen drones or jets into Poland, Estonia, Romania, Norway, possibly Denmark. What should the United States be doing to push back on those provocations?",
      "REP. TURNER: You know, what's interesting about this is it? What we've always said is that, you know, Russia, once they got through Ukraine, would be testing and go- can continue into Europe. But what they're seeing- but what they're seeing now, because they're having this- this success of Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine. They're now going into Poland and Romania, and they're seeing that Poland and Romania don't have the advanced technology that Ukraine does, and instead of going through Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine since- since this is Modern Warfare, and Ukraine is winning it, they're seeing that the old war is actually old Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike Turner, thank you for sharing some of your insights, what you learned on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "REP TURNER: Thank you,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back in a moment. So stay with us."

      "Martha Alicia Mendez Aguilar, known as \"La Diabla,\" was captured on Sept. 2 after officials say the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, referred to by the U.S. as CJNG, lured a handful of pregnant women \u2014 often in vulnerable or impoverished circumstances \u2014 to remote areas. Once there, CJNG traffickers allegedly performed illegal cesarean operations on the women, killing the mothers and allegedly harvesting their organs postmortem, and placing newborns into illicit markets, according to senior intelligence officials. The infants were then sold to couples in the United States for as much as 250,000 pesos or roughly $14,000 each, according to the senior intelligence officials.",
      "Mexican authorities were tipped off by intelligence provided by the National Counterterrorism Center, under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. NCTC Director Joe Kent called the scheme an \"example of what terrorist cartels will do to diversify their revenue streams and finance operations,\" in a statement provided to CBS News, crediting NCTC analysts with tracking Aguilar's patterns and locations, then coordinating with U.S. intelligence and Mexican partners on the ground.",
      "Senior intelligence officials say the arrest involved support from the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI El Paso, Diplomatic Security Service and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with Mexican law enforcement executing the operation alongside \"Fiscalia Especializada en la Mujer\" or the Special Prosecutor's Office for Women. Aguilar remains in Mexican custody, according to senior intelligence officials. The investigation into the alleged trafficking ring remains ongoing.",
      "The case underscores Washington's intensified targeting of Mexican cartels in recent years.",
      "In January, President Trump signed an executive order directing the State Department to designate cartels and transnational gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, or FTOs. The State Department in February announced the designation for eight gangs, including CJNG.",
      "The capture of \"La Diabla\" marks an expansion in the application of U.S. counterterrorism policy, with intelligence elements like NCTC now actively applying counterterrorism capabilities to target not only narcotraffickers, but also human trafficking rings and terroristic violence by groups like CJNG, notorious for brutal tactics and control over swaths of Mexico's territory.",
      "Under the new FTO framing, U.S. agencies wield more expansive tools, including intelligence, sanctions, and military support to track down the cartels and their affiliates, beyond reliance on traditional criminal prosecutions. Critics of the approach have warned of overreach and unintended consequences, while proponents argue that cartels increasingly function like hybrid terrorist groups to pick up territorial control and expand trafficking networks.",
      "According to NCTC, U.S. intelligence has added over 21,000 cartel members and associates into their classified terrorist database, creating over 35,000 identities related to the newly designated foreign terrorist organizations. Last month, the agency stated that 6,525 terrorists have been denied entry into the United States since the beginning of the Trump administration.",

      "The findings, published Thursday, are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990 and have the potential to resolve the long-standing \"Muddle in the Middle\" of human evolution, researchers said.",
      "But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.",
      "The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.",
      "But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to a species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.",
      "\"This changes a lot of thinking,\" said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.",
      "\"It suggests that by 1 million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,\" he added.",
      "The findings shocked the research team.",
      "\"From the very beginning, when we got the result, we thought it was unbelievable. How could that be so deep into the past?\" Xijun Ni, a professor at Fudan University who co-led the analysis, told BBC News. \"But we tested it again and again to test all the models, use all the methods, and we are now confident about the result, and we're actually very excited.\"",
      "If the findings are correct, it suggests there could have been much earlier members of other early hominins, including Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, the researchers said.",
      "It also \"muddies the waters\" on long-standing assumptions that early humans dispersed from Africa, said Michael Petraglia, director of Griffith University's Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"There's a big change potentially happening here, where east Asia is now playing a very key role in hominin evolution,\" he told the Agence France-Presse.",
      "\"A lot of questions\"",
      "The research, published in the journal Science, used advanced CT scanning, structure light imaging and virtual reconstruction techniques to model a complete Yunxian 2. The team then printed replicas on a 3D printer, according to BBC News.",
      "The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.",
      "The resulting model \"shows a distinctive combination of traits,\" the researchers said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.",
      "But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, according to the study.",
      "\"Yunxian 2 may help us resolve what's been called the 'Muddle in the Middle,' the confusing array of human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago,\" Stringer said in a press release.",
      "Much about human evolution remains debated, and Petraglia said the study's findings were \"provocative\" though grounded in solid work.",
      "\"It's sound, but I think the jury's still out. I think there will be a lot of questions raised,\" he said.",
      "Andy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was \"not always a perfect indicator for human evolution.\"",
      "\"They've got this interpretation that I just don't really think is taking into account the genetic histories of these things that we do know,\" he told AFP.",
      "Dr. Aylwyn Scally, an evolutionary geneticist at Cambridge University, told BBC News that although the study's conclusions were plausible, they were far from certain, and that more evidence was needed to be sure.",
      "\"That picture is still quite unclear to us, so if the conclusions of this research are supported by other analyses, ideally from some genetic data, then I think we would start to be increasingly confident about it,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The findings are only the latest in a string of recent research that has complicated what we thought we know about our origins.",
      "Homo longi, also known as \"Dragon Man,\" was itself only named as a new species and close human relative in 2021, by a team that included Stringer.",
      "The authors said their work illustrates the complexity of our shared history.",
      "\"Fossils like Yunxian 2 show just how much we still have to learn about our origins,\" said Stringer.",

      "Marine life is thriving on unexploded Nazi bombs sitting at the bottom of a German bay, a submersible has discovered, even capturing footage of starfishes creeping across a huge chunk of TNT.",
      "The discovery, which was revealed in a study published Thursday, was \"one of those rare but remarkable eureka moments,\" marine biologist Andrey Vedenin told AFP.",
      "The waters off Germany's coast are estimated to be littered with 1.6 million tons of unexploded munitions left behind from both world wars.",
      "In October last year, a team of German scientists went to a previously uncharted dump site in the Baltic Sea's Luebeck Bay and sent an unmanned submersible 20 meters down to the seafloor.",
      "They were surprised when footage from the sub revealed 10 Nazi-era cruise missiles. Then they were stunned when they saw animals covering the surface of the bombs.",
      "There were roughly 40,000 animals per square meter \u2014 mostly marine worms \u2014 living on the munitions,\u00a0the scientists wrote\u00a0in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.",
      "\"Despite the potential negative effects of the toxic munition compounds, published underwater images show dense populations of algae, hydroids, mussels, and other epifauna on the munition objects, including mines, torpedo heads, bombs, and wooden crates,\" the study concludes.",
      "They also counted three species of fish, a crab, sea anemones, a jellyfish relative called hydroids and plenty of starfishes.",
      "While animals covered the hard casing of the bombs, they mostly avoided the yellow explosive material \u2014 except for one instance.",
      "The researchers were baffled to see that more than 40 starfishes had piled on to an exposed chunk of TNT.",
      "\"It looked really weird,\" said Vedenin, a scientist at Germany's Carl von Ossietzky University and the study's lead author.",
      "Exactly why the starfishes were there was unclear, but Vedenin theorized they could be eating bacterial film collecting on the corroding TNT.",
      "Life on deadly weapons",
      "The explosive chemicals are highly toxic, but the animals appeared to have found a way to live near it.",
      "Other than the death-wish starfishes, they did not seem to be behaving strangely.",
      "\"The crabs were just sitting and picking something with their claws,\" Vedenin said.",
      "To find out what kind of bombs they were dealing with, he went online and found a manual from the Nazi air force Luftwaffe describing how to handle and store V-1 flying bombs. The cruise missile exactly matched the 10 bombs from the footage.",
      "Vedenin said \"there is some irony\" in the discovery that these \"things that are meant to kill everything are now attracting so much life.\"",
      "He compared it to how animals such as deer now thrive in radioactive areas abandoned by humans near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.",
      "Hard surfaces on the seafloor are important for marine life that want more than mud and sand.",
      "Animals once flocked to huge boulders that littered the Baltic Sea, however humans removed the stones to build infrastructure such as roads at the start of the 20th century.",
      "So when the Nazi bombs are eventually cleared from the bay, the researchers called for more stones \u2014 or concrete structures \u2014 to be put in place to continue supporting the sea life.",
      "The scientists also plan to return to the spot next month to set up a time-lapse camera to watch what the starfishes do next.",
      "Marine life also thriving in shipwrecks",
      "It's the latest example of wildlife flourishing in polluted sites. Previous research has shown shipwrecks and former weapons complexes teeming with biodiversity.",
      "Studies like these are a testament to how nature takes advantage of human leftovers, flipping the script to survive, said marine conservation biologist David Johnston with Duke University. He recently mapped sunken World War I ships that have become habitats for wildlife along the Potomac River in Maryland.",
      "\"I think it's a really cool testimony to the strength of life,\" Johnston told The Associated Press.",
      "A 2023 paper\u00a0published in BioScience\u00a0found that shipwrecks provide important ecological resources for a wide variety of organisms, from tiny microbes to large marine creatures.",

      "Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.",
      "The new find was possibly 23 feet long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.",
      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws,\" said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "\"Megaraptorans are among the least understood dinosaurs of all,\" Ibiricu told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\" Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",
      "The front leg bone pressed against its jaws \u2014 belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles \u2014 could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.",
      "Study co-author Matt Lamanna told Reuters that unlike the T. rex, which had massive teeth and small arms, the Joaquinraptor likely used its long arms to capture prey.",
      "\"This suggests that these two predatory dinosaur lineages evolved different adaptations to accomplish basically the same thing - that is, to capture, subdue, kill and eat other animals such as other dinosaurs,\" Lamanna told Reuters. \"Precisely why these groups evolved along these different evolutionary pathways remains a mystery, but it shows that, during the Cretaceous, there was more than one way to be a top predator.\"",
      "Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.",
      "\"All children love dinosaurs so he would probably be a fan too,\" he said.",

      "These calls could be played back by intelligence officers, and The Guardian cited three sources within Unit 8200 who said the database was used to help shape military operations in Gaza and the West Bank, and to prepare deadly airstrikes by helping with research and to identify bombing targets in Gaza.",
      "One source told The Guardian that during the planning of an airstrike on an individual in a densely populated area of Gaza, officers would use the system to examine calls made by other people in the immediate vicinity.",
      "Other sources told The Guardian that use of the data was initially focused on the West Bank, which Israel's military controls.",
      "\"When they need to arrest someone and there isn't a good enough reason to do so, that's where they find the excuse,\" one source told the British newspaper.",
      "The Guardian reported that leaked Microsoft files suggested a large proportion of the sensitive data was potentially being stored in Microsoft data centers in Ireland and the Netherlands.",
      "After the publication of its report, several sources told the newspaper that the repository of intercepted calls \u2014 as much as 8,000 terabytes of data \u2014 had been held in a Microsoft data center in the Netherlands, but within days of its report being published in early August, the data appeared to have been moved out of the country.",
      "\"We have found evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting. This evidence includes information relating to IMOD consumption of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and the use of AI services,\" Microsoft said in a statement Thursday, without elaborating on what the evidence showed.",
      "Microsoft said it had informed the Israeli Ministry of Defense that it would be halting and disabling its use of some specific subscriptions and services.",
      "\"We have reviewed this decision with IMOD and the steps we are taking to ensure compliance with our terms of service, focused on ensuring our services are not used for mass surveillance of civilians,\" Microsoft said.",

      "Microsoft said its current review is still ongoing.",
      "It follows an initial review by the American tech giant, triggered by an earlier Guardian report about how the IDF's use of Microsoft's Azure and AI services surged during its Gaza offensive, in which the company said it had found \"no evidence that Microsoft's Azure and AI technologies, or any of our other software, have been used to harm people or that IMOD has failed to comply with our terms of service or our AI Code of Conduct.\"",

    "summary": "YouTube will offer creators a way to rejoin the streaming platform if they were banned for violating COVID-19 and election misinformation policies that are no longer in effect.",
    "story": [
      "YouTube creators whose accounts were banned for violating previous policies against COVID-19 and election misinformation will be given the chance to rejoin the platform, said Alphabet, YouTube's parent company, on Tuesday.",
      "In a letter submitted in response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, attorneys for Alphabet said the decision to bring back banned accounts reflected the company's commitment to free speech.",
      "\"No matter the political atmosphere, YouTube will continue to enable free expression on its platform, particularly as it relates to issues subject to political debate,\" the letter read, noting that a number of accounts were kicked off the platform between 2023 and 2024 for violating misinformation rules that don't exist anymore. Now, it said, \"YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect.\"",
      "The company in its letter also said it \"values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse\" and added that YouTube \"recognizes these creators are among those shaping today's online consumption, landing 'must-watch' interviews, giving viewers the chance to hear directly from politicians, celebrities, business leaders, and more.\"",
      "The move is the latest in a cascade of content moderation rollbacks from tech companies, who cracked down on false information during the pandemic and after the 2020 election but have since faced pressure from President Trump and other conservatives who argue they unlawfully stifled right-wing voices in the process.",
      "It comes as tech CEOs, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, have sought a closer relationship with the Republican president, including through high-dollar donations to his campaign and attending events in Washington.",
      "YouTube in 2023 phased out its policy to remove content that falsely claims the 2020 election, or other past U.S. presidential elections, were marred by \"widespread fraud, errors or glitches.\" Claims of fraud in the 2020 election have been debunked.",
      "The platform in 2024 also retired its standalone COVID-19 content restrictions, allowing various treatments for the disease to be discussed. COVID-19 misinformation now falls under YouTube's broader medical misinformation policy.",
      "Among the creators who have been banned from YouTube under the now-expired policies are prominent conservative influencers, including Dan Bongino, who now serves as deputy director of the FBI. For people who make money on social media, access to monetization on YouTube can be significant, earning them large sums through ad revenue.",
      "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and other congressional Republicans have pressured tech companies to reverse content moderation policies created under former President Joe Biden and accused Biden's administration of unfairly wielding its power over the companies to chill lawful online speech.",
      "In Tuesday's letter, Alphabet's lawyers said senior Biden administration officials \"conducted repeated and sustained outreach\" to coerce the company to remove pandemic-related YouTube videos that did not violate company policies.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content, and the Company has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds,\" the letter said.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also accused the Biden administration of pressuring employees to inappropriately censor content during the COVID-19 pandemic. Elon Musk, the owner of the social platform X, has accused the FBI of illegally coercing Twitter before his tenure to suppress a story about Hunter Biden.",
      "The Supreme Court last year sided with the Biden administration in a dispute with Republican-led states over how far the federal government can go to combat controversial social media posts on topics including COVID-19 and election security.",

      "The Secret Service has disrupted a sprawling telecommunications network in the New York Tri-State Area that investigators say posed a serious potential disruption to New York's telecom systems and a possible threat to the United Nations General Assembly meetings this week.",
      "In the largest seizure of its kind, the U.S. Secret Service announced Tuesday that the agency found active SIM farms at abandoned apartment buildings located at more than five sites. In total, law enforcement discovered 300 SIM servers \u2013 over 100,000 SIM cards \u2013 enabling encrypted, anonymous communication and capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute. Officials say the servers were so powerful they could have disabled cell phone towers and launched distributed denial of services attacks with the ability to block emergency communications like EMS and police dispatch.",
      "\"This network had the potential to disable cell phone towers and essentially shut down the cellular network in New York City,\" U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool said in a video released by the agency.",
      "An official briefed on the investigation told reporters that this week, the sophisticated network \"could text message the entire country within 12 minutes,\" later adding, \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "Telephonic threats to multiple senior U.S. officials this past spring \u2013 including multiple people protected by the Secret Service \u2013 first triggered the investigation, but officials say the network was seized within the last three weeks.",
      "\"We cannot share which officials were targeted out of concerns for their privacy, but as the forensics investigation continues, we do expect that we will find more targeted officials once we get through that data,\" McCool said.",
      "Early analysis shows the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals known to U.S. law enforcement, including members of known organized crime gangs, drug cartels and human trafficking rings, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation. The U.S. Secret Service says it is combing through the more than 100,000 SIM cards in an ongoing, exhaustive forensic analysis.",
      "\"Each SIM basically has the equivalent data of a cell phone. So we're working through every call, every text, every search made on those SIM cards,\" an official told CBS News, adding, \"Early analysis indicates that this network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement here in the U.S.\"",
      "The equipment was found within 35 miles of the United Nations in New York, ahead of the U.N. General Assembly. Investigators also found 80 grams of cocaine, illegal firearms, plus computers and phones.",
      "\"This isn't a group of people in a basement playing a video game and trying to play a prank,\" one official said. \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "\"The timing, the location, the proximity of this network had the potential to impact the U.N. and that was clear and something that we had to consider,\" added McCool.",
      "The investigation was launched by a new division within the U.S. Secret Service established by Director Sean Curran and dubbed the \"Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit,\" in conjunction with Homeland Security Investigations.",
      "\"These devices no longer pose any threat to New York,\" an official said. \"We've taken care of and dismantled that threat\u2026There is currently no credible threat against the UN.\"",
      "Still, another official added that \"it would be unwise to assume\" there aren't other such networks in the U.S.",
      "The investigation remains ongoing, according to the U.S. Secret Service. There have been no arrests yet, but officials said, \"there could be arrests down the road,\" adding that \"from an operational perspective, we want those behind the network to know that the Secret Service is aware and that we're kind of coming for them.\"",
      "Homeland Security Investigations is leading the criminal investigation into individuals involved in coordinating this large scheme, while the U.S. Secret Service is running down threats tied back to its protectees, according to multiple U.S. officials.",
      "In a statement released by the U.S. Secret Service, the agency also thanked the Department of Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the NYPD, as well as other state and local law enforcement partners, for providing technical advice and assistance.",

    "story": [
      "Robot umpires are getting called up to the big leagues next season.",
      "Major League Baseball's 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System in the major leagues in 2026.",
      "Human plate umpires will still call balls and strikes, but teams can challenge two calls per game and get additional appeals in extra innings. Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter \u2014 signaled by tapping their helmet or cap \u2014 and a team retains its challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as digital graphics on outfield videoboards.",
      "Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections. MLB said 61.5% of ejections among players, managers and coaches last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.",
      "Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.",
      "The Automated Ball-Strike Challenge System, powered by T-Mobile, is coming to MLB's Regular Season \u26be\ufe0f https://t.co/97raRHFtsT pic.twitter.com/SHxKuRTKu8",
      "ABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that year's Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.",
      "In 2019, Fred DeJesus became the first umpire in a regular-season game to use ABS. He remembers the first pitch he tested \u2013 it was a strike \u2013 and how he was hesitant about the new technology at first.",
      "\"Initially, it was like, no way, we're not doing this. I spent way too much money trying to learn the craft of calling balls and strikes,\" he told CBS News in 2021.",
      "At Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.",
      "MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182) challenges.",
      "At Triple-A this season, the average challenges per game increased to 4.2 from 3.9 through Sunday and the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%. Defenses were successful in 53.7% of challenges this year and offenses in 45%.",
      "ABS was used in this year's All-Star Game as well and has generally received positive reviews, CBS Sports reported. Four of five challenges of plate umpire Dan Iassogna's calls were successful in July.",
      "Teams in Triple-A do not get additional challenges in extra innings. However, the proposal approved by the MLB on Tuesday included a provision granting teams one additional challenge each inning if they don't have challenges remaining.",
      "MLB has experimented with different shapes and interpretations of the strike zone with ABS, including versions that were three-dimensional. Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.",
      "This will be MLB's first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, restrictions on defensive shifts, pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts and larger bases.",
      "The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers. While there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete, not everyone considers the skill a good thing.",
      "\"The idea that people get paid for cheating, for stealing strikes, for moving a pitch that's not a strike into the zone to fool the official and make it a strike is beyond my comprehension,\" former manager Bobby Valentine said.",
      "Texas manager Bruce Bochy, a big league catcher from 1978-87, maintained old-school umpires such as Bruce Froemming and Billy Williams never would have accepted pitch framing. He said they would have told him: \"'If you do that again, you'll never get a strike.' I'm cutting out some words.\"",

      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill has stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes are needed to advance it. Democrats want an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have opposed. Without a resolution, the government will begin to shut down on Wednesday.",
      "If funding lapses, federal employees in critical positions would be required to stay on the job. Many others would be forced to stay home. Both groups would have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown threat means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid if there's a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck even if they haven't reached a deal to fund the government.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" This means they must get paid whether or not other parts of the government are funded.",
      "Pursuant to that section, members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election. Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "On Friday, the Labor Department posted a 73-page \"contingency plan\" detailing operations if government funding lapses at midnight on Sept. 30. If that occurs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) would suspend all operations, including data collection activities for BLS surveys, website updates and economic reports, the plan states.",
      "The BLS is scheduled to release its report on September employment gains on Oct. 3. In a shutdown, government agencies must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded from other sources, such as fees, or under other legislation.",
      "The BLS' closely watched monthly jobs report drew scrutiny last month when President Trump\u00a0fired its commissioner of labor statistics after disappointing employment numbers. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled it is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness amid a hiring slowdown.",
      "Awkward timing",
      "Earlier this month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited headwinds facing the labor market as a key factor in the central bank's vote for an\u00a0interest rate cut\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "\"The timing of the looming potential government shutdown is not ideal for the Fed, which is set to meet again on October 29th,\" said Mike Reid, senior U.S. economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, in a research report.",
      "Although it's unclear whether a shutdown will occur or how long it could last, the possibility raises the risk that some government economic reports would not be available to the Fed before its next meeting on Oct. 29, he added.",
      "\"In our view, an increasingly data dependent Federal Reserve with limited visibility into the September data increases the probability of an October pause,\" meaning that the Fed could hold off on an additional rate cut at the Oct. 29 meeting, Reid\u00a0wrote.",
      "Earlier this month, the BLS reported that\u00a0employers added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' forecasts. The September report, scheduled for Friday, is expected to show about 50,500 new hires, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "\"We believe that a shutdown will have only a small and transitory economic impact, but it may spur some financial market volatility, especially if delays in government economic reports obscure the path of Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts,\" said Jennifer Timmerman, investment strategy analyst, in a Wells Fargo Investment Institute\u00a0report\u00a0released Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Sunday that a government shutdown is likely unless top Democrats back down from their negotiating position.",
      "\"I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview with CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump also expressed confidence that the American people will side with him if government funding expires in the coming days, and he believes Democrats will pay a political price for not working with him, on his terms, to further cut spending.",
      "\"They're not interested in fraud, waste and abuse,\" Mr. Trump said of the Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump will meet Monday with congressional leaders ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline for lawmakers to reach an agreement on a spending bill that would avert a shutdown.",
      "A source close to Mr. Trump told CBS News that the president privately welcomes the prospect of a shutdown because it will enable him to wield executive power to slash some government programs and salaries.",
      "Last week, the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies telling them to prepare layoff plans if there is a government shutdown.",
      "The memo, obtained by CBS News, tells agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices \u2014 a federal term for layoffs \u2014 for employees in programs, projects or activities that have discretionary funding that stops on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. It also goes further and says that employees should get RIF notices if they're in programs or projects \"not consistent with the President's priorities.\"",
      "In the interview Sunday, Mr. Trump cast the Democrats' current demands \u2014\u00a0 which in recent weeks have focused on seeking to extend Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies \u2014\u00a0 as ill-advised.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said, if the Democrats want to discuss health care, they should work with him to prevent undocumented migrants from accessing public benefits.",
      "\"The Democrats, incredibly, want to keep their old policies of open borders and we're not going to have it. We're not going to allow it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Any possible health-care negotiations, Mr. Trump added, must address immigration and border-related matters, otherwise, \"It's just not acceptable for us.\"",
      "Democrats have forcefully pushed back against Mr. Trump's characterization of their positions on both government funding and on immigration. And they have repeatedly noted that people who are in the U.S. illegally are not eligible to receive Medicaid coverage.",
      "\"Donald Trump knows, or at least I think he knows, that current federal law prohibits using taxpayer dollars for undocumented immigrants in connection with their health care. And no one is trying to change or reverse that law,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told MSNBC on Saturday. \"What we are doing is fighting to protect the healthcare of everyday Americans in the midst of this Republican-caused crisis that is devastating hospitals and nursing homes and community-based health clinics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet Monday with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Jeffries.",
      "The meeting comes after the president canceled an initial meeting last week, citing the Democrats' \"unserious and ridiculous\" demands.",
      "Earlier this month, the House approved a GOP-led continuing resolution to keep the government funded until Nov. 21. But Democrats put forward their own proposal that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31, along with implementing other priorities for the party, including their health-care request. In the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to advance most legislation, both the bill passed by the House\u00a0to fund the government and the Democrats' proposal fell short.",
      "The Democrats' proposal included a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which Democrats have suggested is a red line for their support. The proposal would also roll back cuts to Medicaid in Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "The Senate is returning to Washington on Monday after a weeklong recess, and will have little time to act to avert a shutdown. Echoing Mr. Trump, Thune told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that it's \"totally up to the Democrats\" whether the government shuts down, saying \"there is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now\" that the House passed that would keep the government open.",
      "\"This decision, in my judgment at this point in time, is up to a handful of Democrats,\" Thune said. \"We need eight Democrats to pass it through the Senate.\"",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, told \"Face the Nation\" Sunday that \"Democrats are united in pushing\" on the health-care issue, adding that she's glad the president has decided to meet with leaders in Congress.",
      "\"This is an opportunity for the country because of one big problem, and that is that the Republicans have created a health care crisis,\" Klobuchar said. \"My constituents, Americans, are standing on a cliff right now with these insurance premium increases that are upon them.\"",

    "story": [
      "The 22-year-old man charged with killing Charlie Kirk\u00a0appeared in court remotely on Monday. During the hearing, the suspect and his newly appointed legal counsel decided they want a preliminary hearing where the judge will determine if there is enough evidence against him to go forward with a trial.",
      "Prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson with aggravated murder and plan to seek the death penalty. Robinson didn't enter a plea during Monday's hearing.",
      "The Utah state court system gives people accused of crimes an option to waive their legal right to a preliminary hearing and instead schedule an arraignment where they can enter a plea. Kathryn Nester, the lead attorney appointed to represent Robinson, said that the defense team would need time to go through all of the evidence in the case before letting the judge know when they would be ready for the hearing.",
      "\"Until we can kinda get our heads around exactly what we're dealing with and how much we need to process, it's going to be difficult for us to give you a reasonable expectation of when we will be ready to do the prelim,\" Nester told Judge Tony Graf Jr.",
      "Robinson is scheduled to appear in person for his next hearing on Oct. 30. The hearing in Provo was open to the public, just a few miles from the Utah Valley University campus in Orem, where the Sept. 10 shooting\u00a0happened, launching a day-and-a-half search for the suspect.",
      "Graf told prosecutors and the defense lawyers that Robinson's constitutional rights would be protected as the case moves forward.",
      "\"He sits before this court presumed innocent, and that presumption remains unless and until each element of every offense charged against him is proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the judge said. \"At the same time and as applicable, victims are entitled under our Constitution to be treated with fairness, respect and dignity, free from harassment or abuse. Justice demands that both of these principles \u2014 the rights of the accused and the rights of victims \u2014 be honored without compromise.\"",
      "Authorities arrested Robinson when he showed up with his parents at his hometown sheriff's office in southwest Utah, more than a three-hour drive from the site of the shooting, to turn himself in. Prosecutors have since revealed text messages and DNA evidence that they say connect Robinson to the killing.",
      "Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray told reporters before the first hearing  that Robinson's mother had said her son had begun to date his roommate, who was transitioning from male to female.",
      "A note that Robinson had allegedly left for his roommate before the shooting said he had the opportunity to kill one of the nation's leading conservative voices, \"and I'm going to take it,\" Gray said. Gray also said that Robinson wrote in a text about Kirk to his roommate: \"I had enough of his hatred.\"",
      "According to court documents, Robinson allegedly wrote in a text, \"To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age.\"",
      "When the roommate asked Robinson if he was Kirk's shooter, Robinson allegedly replied, \"I am, I'm sorry.\"",
      "The assassination of Kirk, a close ally of President Trump who worked to steer young voters toward conservatism, has galvanized Republicans who have vowed to carry on Kirk's mission of moving American politics further to the right.",
      "Mr. Trump has declared Kirk a \"martyr\" for freedom and threatened to crack down on what he called the \"radical left.\"",
      "Workers across the country have been punished or fired for speaking out about Kirk after his death, including teachers, public and private employees and media personalities \u2014 most notably Jimmy Kimmel, who had his late-night show suspended then quickly reinstated by ABC.",
      "Kirk's political organization, Arizona-based Turning Point USA, brought young, evangelical Christians into politics through his podcast, social media and campus events. Many prominent Republicans are filling in at the upcoming campus events Kirk was meant to attend, including Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and Sen. Mike Lee at Utah State University on Tuesday.",

      "The number of cases in Texas alone grew to over\u00a0760\u00a0before the state declared it officially over in August, while total cases nationwide have topped 1,500, with infections confirmed in at least 39 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases, can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country, as well.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Wednesdays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak primarily affected\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or had an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",

This under-age edition includes protection policies such as blocking sexual content and \u2014 \"in rare cases of acute distress\" \u2014 law enforcement to ensure a user's safety, according to the company.",

Raine's family allege that ChatGPT led their teen to commit suicide.",

      "Even if a U.S.\u00a0government shutdown begins on Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress, with lawmakers currently at loggerheads over funding the federal government past Sept. 30.",
      "If an agreement isn't reached before then, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for their operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",

Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

    "summary": "While the tariffs will impact everyone to some degree, experts say more of the pain will be felt by lower-income consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Fresh tariffs on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities recently announced by President Trump on social media\u00a0could cause already high prices to rise even further, and deter some Americans from embarking on home renovation projects.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday said his administration will levy a 50% tariff on all imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and \"associated products,\" plus a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture from abroad.",
      "Preventing what he called the \"flooding\" of such goods into the U.S. is a matter of national security, the president added. Both sets of tariffs will kick in Oct. 1, he said. \"It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture \u2014 much of which is imported \u2014 rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025,\u00a0the latest CPI data shows, driven by Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs, according to economists.\u00a0Furniture and bedding also rose 4.7% over the same period, and 2.8% for household furnishings and supplies.",
      "If the new levies go into effect, furniture makers will feel the hit, and some will likely pass the costs on to consumers, industry analysts told CBS News. The sectoral tariffs could also hinder business activity and growth, they added, as companies wait to see if tariff policies change and defer investment decisions.",
      "\"Higher prices are an inevitable consequence of these tariffs,\" Zak Stambor, a retail analyst at market research company eMarketer, told CBS News. \"People undergoing bathroom or kitchen renovations are in a tough spot right now because there was so little warning. The costs of those things will now be higher, and people might not have already bought them because they were waiting for permits.\"",
      "Low-income consumers will feel the squeeze the most, not just because they have less discretionary income but because lower-cost furniture sold in the U.S. tends to be imported from Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia and India.",
      "Some higher-end furniture is manufactured in the U.S., and therefore less exposed to tariffs, according to Telsey Advisory Group managing director and senior retail analyst Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. She said retailers will have no choice but to raise prices on imported goods once the tariffs take effect.",
      "\"They are trying not to raise prices too much ahead of holiday season. But they can't absorb 30% tariffs on top of other tariffs that are already in place,\" she told CBS News. \"They'll have to pass through pricing, probably in the form of a double-digit price increase.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News's request for comment on analysts' claims the tariffs could drive up prices or inhibit business investment.",
      "Uncertainty persists",
      "From retailers' point of view, the levies could make investing in new inventory a riskier and more difficult proposition, according to Stambor, as costs and consumer demand could shift.",

      "\"That was the scariest moment of my life, not knowing if my family was OK,\" Paul Kirby said Monday on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Kirby's wife and children were with him at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Michigan's Grand Blanc Township when\u00a0a gunman rammed his vehicle into the church and began shooting\u00a0just before 10:30 a.m. Sunday. Kirby said church members were attending a service when they heard \"a loud boom coming from the back wall of the chapel.\"",
      "\"Several of us men decided to get up and go outside to look at what happened, just in case somebody ran off the road and hit the building,\" Kirby said. \"We didn't think anything bad was going to happen.\"",
      "Once outside, Kirby saw a man holding a gun and then start shooting. At that point, he said he turned around to run back inside the church and find his family. He recalled feeling shrapnel strike his left leg and seeing a bullet pierce a glass door just a foot away.",
      "\"It was just so unexpected,\" Kirby said. \"Once I saw the gun and start hearing him start shooting it, it was just a lot of fear.\"",
      "As he was running, he said he was \"expecting to get a bullet in the back of my legs or in my back or something.\"",
      "Investigators are returning Monday to the scene of the attack, which the FBI is probing as \"an act of targeted violence,\" CBS News Detroit reported.",
      "Authorities have identified the gunman as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, of Burton, Michigan. They say he drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church and then proceeded to fire multiple rounds from an assault rifle. About 100 worshippers were inside the building at the time. Officials say he also used an accelerant to start a blaze that destroyed much of the building.",
      "At least four people were killed in the shooting and at least eight others suffered injuries that required hospitalization. One of the injured people was in critical condition, while the remaining seven were reported to be in stable condition, according to CBS News Detroit.",

    "story": [
      "On Sept. 29, 1916, it was front page news that a surge in Standard Oil's stock price likely made oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller America's first billionaire.",
      "More than a century later, the United States is home to hundreds of billionaires whose fortunes increasingly come from technology and financial markets. Together, they control a growing share of the country's wealth \u2014 approaching the percentage held by Gilded Age industrialists who built monopolies in railroads, oil and steel.",
      "Here's what research tells us about America's billionaire class today.",
      "American billionaires number over 900, according to researchers",
      "There are a few different estimates of the number of American billionaires, but researchers tend to agree that the billionaire class exceeds 900 and is growing.",
      "Forbes, which has produced a list of billionaires since the 1980s, counted roughly 900 in early 2025 \u2014 up from 813 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the wealth-data firm Altrata pinned the number of U.S. billionaires at 1,135 in 2024, an uptick from 1,050 in 2023 and up more than 80% from levels in 2016, when they began releasing yearly reports.",
      "And JP Morgan Chase Private Bank estimated the number at roughly 1,990 in 2024 \u2014 about 15% more than its 2023 estimate.",
      "Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates.",
      "Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set.",
      "His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and\u00a0Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29.",
      "Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, \"The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people.\"",
      "Billionaires have roughly $6.8 trillion in wealth in 2025",
      "Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024.",
      "In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth \"could be turned into cash and distributed equally\u2014which it couldn't\u2014[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each.\"",
      "Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person.",
      "Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt\u00a0and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over.",
      "The ultra rich own an increasingly large share of the nation's wealth",
      "Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades \u2014 toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age.",
      "The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data.",
      "\"What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses,\" said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas.",
      "But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri.",
      "By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth \u2014 up over 10 percentage points from 1980.",
      "Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country \u2014 or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023.",
      "The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023.",
      "Most billionaires are males with self-made fortunes, but a significant number inherited their money",
      "Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways.",
      "The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men \u2014 about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes \u2014 and most make rather than inherit their wealth.",
      "Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of \"A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.\"",
      "\"He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks,\" Nichols said. \"But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time.\"",
      "Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data.",
      "Some of America's wealthiest heirs include Walmart's Alice, Rob and Jim Walton, and Jacqueline Mars, who owns roughly one third of the candy giant Mars founded by her grandfather.",

    "summary": "With the federal government on the brink of another lapse in funding, here's a look at the 14 shutdowns that have occurred since 1980.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress appears to be barreling toward another government shutdown, with President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward for averting a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump said Sunday that a shutdown is likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president is set to meet with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, though a breakthrough to avert a shutdown appears to be a long way off.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, year-long spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government is on the verge of shutting down if Congress does not reach a deal to approve new funding by Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025.",
      "Republicans have proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides are dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders are set to meet with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during a government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-september-2025-economic-impact-social-security-tsa/",
    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin on Wednesday, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap. Federal agencies develop plans ahead of a shutdown to determine which employees will remain working.",
      "For instance, the Department of Health and Human Services posted its shutdown plan on Sept. 25, which states that more than 32,000 employees, or about 41% of the agency's workforce, will be furloughed. The other employees are either funded through sources other than annual appropriations or will continue to work, although without pay, because they are in essential roles.",
      "And while federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "Government shutdowns have typically been short, with the pay of military service persons often seen as a deadline for getting funding restored, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report. The next military pay date at risk from a shutdown would be Oct. 15, they noted.",
      "\"For civilian employees, the first pay date at risk would be Oct. 10 but this is less likely to drive a compromise,\" the analysts noted.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a self-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

      "He said, \"This place used to help so much to Palestinian civilians \u2013 send them money and take some of them from the border to hospitals in Israel.\" Those memories are hard to reconcile with his last moments here.",
      "He says he knew he was being kidnapped: \"I understood Arabic. My last second in the house, I just turned my head and like that to my daughters and said, 'I'll come back.'\"",
      "It's a nightmare he details in his book \"Hostage,\" a gripping account of his ordeal, in which he wrote on page one, \"Five terrorists enter with weapons drawn. We are in our pajamas; they come with uniforms, balaclavas, and Kalashnikovs. They found us.\"",
      "\"I will never forget the fears in my daughter's eyes,\" he said. \"It was horrible.\"",
      "In that horrible chaos of the day when 250 others were taken hostage, Sharabi was ultimately brought into a home and tied up.",
      "\"After 52 days, they moved us to the tunnels,\" he said. \"The first mosque we've seen, we got in, they opened the door on the floor, and we've seen the ladder and they asked us to climb down, something like 30 meters. It looked like the perfect grave.\"",
      "In the tunnels under Gaza, Sharabi was held with various hostages, including American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was later murdered by Hamas at age 24. Golberg-Polin often repeated a quote which stuck with Sharabi: \"He who has a why to live, can bear any how.\"",
      "\"You're looking for any source that give you hope, that give you strength,\" Sharabi said.",
      "His captors told him his wife and daughters were alive, seen at protests campaigning for his release. It was the \"why\" he needed to cope with that torture in the tunnels.",
      "\"They beat us,\" Sharabi said. \"One time they broke my ribs and I couldn't breathe properly for two or three months, and my friend needed to help me to stand to go to the bathroom. They undressed us every two weeks and look for things that maybe we are going to attack them with them.\"",
      "What did that experience do to him? \"It's very humiliating moments for you,\" he said, \"and especially when you are chained to your friends, leg by leg, and you need to go to the bathroom with him \u2026 you have to go together. It's very, very humiliating moment. There's no running water, so you use bottles. You can see the worms everywhere. Worms, rats, cockroaches.\"",
      "When we were in Kibbutz Be'eri in mid-September, explosions could be heard as Israel stepped up its ground offensive in Gaza. \"It's not nice, these explosions,\" Sharabi said. \"Especially when you think it's another 48 hostages remain there. Two years. It's awful for both sides.\"",
      "I asked, \"There are going to be people who watch this and say, 'You're giving this space to this man to share his story. What about the 60,000-plus people in Gaza who've been killed?'\"",
      "\"First of all, they need to remember who started October 7,\" Sharabi replied. \"If someone can explain to me how you fighting against a terror organization that hiding behind his own population without people to get hurt, innocent people, I don't know how to do it.\"",
      "He worries especially about another captive he left behind: 24-year-old Alon Ohel. Sharabi became a father figure to him in their year-plus together, and when Sharabi found out he was going to be freed, Ohel was not on the list. \"You imagine this moment hundreds of times,\" Sharabi said. \"And you believe it's going to be the happiest moment ever. And because of Alon, this moment become very complicated. He had small panic attack. He started to cry and shaking. So, we took water, washed his face, hugging him. It wasn't easy.\"",
      "He says his mission now is to bring all of the hostages home. Sharabi has been fighting to get the remaining living hostages out, along with the bodies of those, like his brother, Yossi, who were killed in captivity.",
      "Sharabi's emotions are often close to the surface, but kept in check, even describing the unimaginable: being shackled. \"We were chained with iron chains on our legs, 24/7,\" he said. \"Every step you make, it's not more than three inches. It was a week before the release when they took it off, and our legs start to fly all over the place. We couldn't control them because we didn't know how to walk.\"",
      "When he was released, he'd lost 66 pounds. The handover was terrifying, he says, but he could endure anything just to hug his wife and daughters again. Then, he heard this from the social worker greeting him in Israel: Your mother and your sister waiting for you.",
      "Sharabi said when he heard that he said, \"'Well, just bring me Lianne and my daughters.' And she said, 'Well, your mother and your sister will tell you.'\"",
      "Lianne, Noiya and Yahel were among the 1,200 people killed on October 7, 2023.",
      "Next to their graves is a place for his brother, Yossi.",
      "Today, Sharabi said, \"I choose life. I need to be strong for them. I don't have the privilege to break. I'm really grateful for my second chance.\"",
      "He says he thinks of his wife and daughters and the life they missed. \"But I'm very positive the life I'm going to rebuild,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"How can you be so positive after losing so much?\"",
      "\"I love life. I love life,\" he replied. \"I'm very proud that I'm that meaningful for other people. It's the most moving feeling that you can feel, that people care about you. People say for me, 'We lose simple things, and we think our world is finished. And you lost your brother, your wife, and your daughters, and you're smiling today. How's that possible?'\"",
      "And his response? \"I can't do anything, anything that bring back Lianne, Noyia, Yahel, Yossi. And so, the best thing I can do for their memories is to be optimistic and to be strong and to rebuild my life.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Iranian authorities said Monday they had hanged a man they accused of spying for Israel, the latest in what is believed to be the largest wave of executions by Tehran in decades, according to activists monitoring human rights issues and the use of the death penalty in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iran\u00a0identified the executed man as Bahman Choobiasl. His case hadn't previously been reported in Iranian state media to activists monitoring human rights issues and the use of the death penalty in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iranian state media outlet\u00a0Mizan\u00a0reported Monday that Choobiasl \"had engaged in extensive and deliberate cooperation with the Israeli intelligence service in the field of databases.\" CBS News has reached out to Iranian authorities for comment.",
      "The execution came as Iran vowed to confront what it called its enemies after the United Nations reimposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program this weekend. The European Union followed suit Monday, imposing similar sanctions on Iran.",
      "Iran accused Choobiasl of meeting with operatives from the Israeli spy agency Mossad, calling him the agency's \"most trusted\" spy. Iran's Mizan news agency, which is the judiciary's official mouthpiece, said Choobiasl worked on \"sensitive telecommunications projects\" and reported about the \"paths of importing electronic devices.\"",
      "Iran is known to have hanged nine people for espionage since its June war with Israel. Israel carried out 12 days of air strikes on Iran in June, killing at least 1,100 people according to Amnesty International.",
      "Earlier this month, the Iranian government executed Babak Shahbazi, according to Amnesty International's Iran chapter, which said in a\u00a0post on social media that Shahbazi's execution was \"arbitrary\" and \"horrific.\" Tehran had alleged that Shahbazi spied for Israel but human rights activists have disputed that, saying he was tortured into a false confession after he wrote a letter to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offering to fight for Kyiv. Iran has taken Russia's side in that conflict, giving its military critical support, including armed drones.",
      "The Islamic Republic routinely conducts closed-door trials of people accused of espionage and other crimes, with defendants often prevented from seeing or disputing the evidence against them.",
      "Iran has faced multiple nationwide protests in recent years, fueled by anger over the economy, demands for women's rights and calls for the country's theocracy to change.",
      "The Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights and the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran put the number of people executed in 2025 at over 1,000, noting the number could be higher as the government does not report on each execution.",
      "United Nations human rights experts also criticized Iran's executions on Monday",
      "\"The sheer scale of executions in Iran is staggering and represents a grave violation of the right to life,\" U.N. experts from the Office of the High Commissioner said in a statement\u00a0Monday. \"With an average of more than nine hangings per day in recent weeks, Iran appears to be conducting executions at an industrial scale that defies all accepted standards of human rights protection.\"",
      "The United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran\u00a0early Sunday on the grounds that it was violating its 2015 agreement to limit its nuclear program, further squeezing the Islamic Republic as growing numbers of Iranians struggle to afford basic needs.",
      "The sanctions will again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran, and penalize any development of Iran's ballistic missile program, among other measures. It came via a mechanism known as \"snapback,\" included in Iran's 2015 nuclear deal\u00a0with world powers, and comes as the country's economy already is reeling.",

It's something the president's going to make the final determination on,\" Vance said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"",

      "The Trump administration has implemented a policy of selling weapons to Ukraine that would be paid for by European NATO countries in August,\u00a0under terms of a deal struck between Mr. Trump and NATO leaders earlier in the summer.",
      "On Sunday, Vance said the U.S. was considering the sale of Tomahawk missiles in line with that policy. \"What we're doing is asking the Europeans to buy that weaponry that shows some European skin in the game. I think that gets them really invested in both what's happening in their own backyard, but also in the peace process that the president has been pushing for, for the last eight months,\" Vance said.",
      "The U.S.-made Tomahawk missile has a range of about 1,500 miles, which would place Moscow well within the range of Kyiv should the Ukrainian government obtain them.",
      "On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov implied that the U.S. was directly interfering in the war between Russian and Ukraine. \"Moscow has heard Washington's statements about possible Tomahawk deliveries to Ukraine and is carefully analyzing them,\" Peskov said at a news conference. \"It is important to understand who will be directing and launching the Tomahawk missiles from Ukrainian territory \u2014 the Americans or the Ukrainians themselves.\"",

      "\"I think reading what he (Mr. Trump) has said, and reading what Vice President Vance has said ... the answer is yes. Use the ability to hit deep,\" Kellogg said.",
      "Russia fired more than 600 drones and missiles\u00a0at targets across Ukraine in the early hours of Sunday morning, the Ukrainian Air Force\u00a0said in a statement. The attacks killed four people and wounded dozens more, Ukrainian officials said, and was one of the largest aerial barrages Ukraine has faced since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.",
      "Mr. Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Russia's failure to come to the table to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine, and he has offered Ukraine encouragement over the past week in its fight to repel Russian troops.",
      "\"Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger,'\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post Tuesday.",
      "\"I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form. With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,\" Mr. Trump said.",

      "Moldova's pro-Western governing party won a clear parliamentary majority, defeating pro-Russian groups in an election that was widely viewed as a stark choice between East and West.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the election outcome in a social media post Monday.",
      "\"Moldova, you've done it again. No attempt to sow fear or division could break your resolve. You made your choice clear: Europe. Democracy. Freedom,\" Von der Leyen said. \"Our door is open. And we will stand with you every step of the way.\"",
      "With nearly all polling station reports counted on Monday, electoral data showed the pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity, or PAS, had 50.1% of the vote, while the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc had 24.2%. The Russia-friendly Alternativa Bloc came third, followed by the populist Our Party. The right-wing Democracy at Home party also won enough votes to enter parliament.",

Recean has also previously served as Sandu's defense and security adviser.",
      "The election was widely viewed as a geopolitical choice for Moldovans between a path to the European Union or a drift back into Moscow's fold. The outcome of Sunday's high-stakes voting was noteworthy considering Moldovan authorities' repeated claims that Russia was conducting a vast\u00a0\"hybrid war\"\u00a0to try to sway the outcome.",
      "Moldova applied to join the EU in 2022 in the wake of Russia's\u00a0full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and was granted candidate status that year. Brussels agreed to open accession negotiations last year.",

      "On Friday, Moldova's President Sandu had said it was the country's \"most consequential election.\"",
      "\"Its outcome will decide whether we consolidate our democracy and join the EU, or whether Russia drags us back into a grey zone, making us a regional risk,\" Sandu said in a\u00a0post on X.",

      "\"A PAS majority saves the party from having to form a coalition that would have most likely been unstable and would have slowed down the pace of reforms to join the EU,\" he said, adding that \"Moldova will continue to be in a difficult geopolitical environment characterized by Russia's attempts to pull it back into its sphere of influence.\"",
      "In an interview with the AP days before the vote, PAS leader Igor Grosu also warned of Russian interference and said Sunday's results would define the country's future \"not just for the next four years, but for many, many years ahead.\"",
      "\"But I believe in the determination and mobilization spirit of Moldovans, at home and in the diaspora,\" he said.",

    "summary": "This is the first major bombardment since an air attack in August on Kyiv left at least 21 people dead.",
    "story": [
      "Russia unleashed a barrage of drones and missiles on Ukraine overnight into Sunday, killing at least four people, with the capital city of Kyiv suffering the heaviest assault.",
      "This is the first major bombardment since an air attack on Kyiv left at least 21 people dead last month.",
      "The attack comes as the United Nations General Assembly concluded in New York and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked for help from world leaders. \"Don't stay silent while Russia keeps dragging this war on,\" he said.",
      "President Trump said that NATO countries should shoot down Russian drones that violate their airspace. Mr. Trump said Zelenskyy was \"putting up one hell of a fight.\"",
      "Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, meanwhile, told leaders on Saturday that while his country doesn't have any plans to attack Europe, any aggression against his country would be met with an \"aggressive response.\"",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday after leading a congressional delegation to Ukraine that Mr. Trump \"really needs to\" lift restrictions on Ukraine's ability to use long range weapons to attack Russia.",
      "\"Ukraine needs to have the ability to use long range weapons to push Russia back,\" Turner said. \"And when they're able to do that, they will get their territory back. If they are able to do that, they will win this war.\"",
      "Kyiv bears the brunt of the attack",
      "Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Administration, confirmed Sunday's casualties via Telegram and said 10 others were wounded in the attack that targeted civilian areas across the city. A 12-year-old girl was among the dead. Thick black smoke could be seen rising from a blast near the city center.",
      "\"The Russians have restarted the child death counter,\" Tkachenko wrote on Telegram.",
      "Russia fired a total of 595 exploding drones and decoys and 48 missiles, Ukraine's air force said Sunday. Of those, air defenses shot down or jammed 566 drones and 45 missiles.",
      "Besides Kyiv, Zelenskyy said the bombardment targeted the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, and Odesa. Zelenskyy wrote on X that at least 40 people were wounded across the country. Later, Ukraine's Interior Ministry stated the number of the wounded rose to 70, with over a hundred civilian objects damaged.",
      "Zaporizhzhia's regional head, Ivan Fedorov, said three children were among the 27 wounded in the region, adding that over two dozen buildings were damaged in the capital that bears the same name.",
      "\"This vile attack came virtually (at) the close of UN General Assembly week, and this is exactly how Russia declares its true position. Moscow wants to keep fighting and killing, and it deserves the toughest pressure from the world,\" Zelenskyy wrote.",
      "Residents shaken",
      "The strikes that began overnight and continued after dawn on Sunday also targeted residential buildings, civilian infrastructure, a medical facility and a kindergarten, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, who also said damage was reported at more than 20 locations across the capital.",
      "At Kyiv's central train station, passengers arrived to the crackle of anti-aircraft gunfire and the low buzz of attack drones. Mostly women, they waited quietly in a platform underpass until the air raid alert ended. Parents checked the news on their phones while children played online games.",
      "\"The sky has turned black again,\" said one woman at the station, who gave only her first name, Erika. \"It's happening a lot.\"",
      "Ilona Kovalenko, a 38-year-old resident of a five-story building struck in Kyiv's Solomianskyi district, told The Associated Press she woke up because of the explosion, which shattered windows.",
      "\"A neighbor kept knocking on our door. She was completely covered in blood and shouting, 'help, save my daughter,'\" said Kovalenko, who fled the building with her grandmother after the strike.",
      "Oleksandra, the neighbor's daughter, was the 12-year-old killed in the attack.",
      "\"Sadly, she died on the spot,\" Kovalenko said. \"We are in shock, to be honest.\"",
      "Another multi-story residential building was heavily damaged by the attack. Emergency services personnel used power saws to clear the debris. Piles of glass littered nearby sidewalks as building residents, some looking shaken, sat on benches.",
      "Russian officials did not immediately comment on the attacks.",
      "Polish military responses triggered",
      "The assault also triggered military responses in neighboring Poland, where fighter jets were deployed early Sunday morning as Russia struck targets in western Ukraine, according to the Polish armed forces.",
      "Polish military officials characterized these defensive measures as \"preventative.\"",
      "International concerns have mounted recently that the fighting could spread beyond Ukraine's borders as European countries rebuked Russia for what they said were provocations. The incidents have included Russian drones landing on Polish soil and Russian fighter aircraft entering Estonian airspace.",
      "Russia denied its planes entered Estonian airspace and said none of its drones targeted Poland.",
      "The latest bombardment follows Zelenskyy's announcement Saturday of what he called a \"mega deal\" for weapons purchases from the United States. The $90 billion package includes both the major arms agreement and a separate \"drone deal\" for Ukrainian-made drones that the U.S. will purchase directly.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight into Sunday."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Robert Costa that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. We have breaking news as we begin what is likely to be another turbulent week here in Washington. Congress faces a government shutdown deadline of October 1. Our Robert Costa spoke this morning to President Trump. Bob, top leaders, both parties, both sides of the Capitol, are coming to the White House. Did the President tell you he thinks a shutdown can be avoided?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: A shutdown looks likely at this point based on my conversation this morning with President Trump. He says both sides are at a stalemate. Democrats want to extend health care subsidies that were part of the Affordable Care Act, but President Trump said his focus on health care is on preventing undocumented migrants from having access to any of the U.S. health care system. Now, it's illegal for any non-citizen to have that sort of access, but President Trump says we're not going to have it. Quote, we're not going to allow it, in terms of moving forward on any discussion, unless the Democrats come to his side on health care and don't focus on the subsidies. But based on my conversations with top Democrats, that's not going to happen. So President Trump told me quote, I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue. That makes a shutdown quite likely. And inside the White House, sources are saying President Trump actually welcomes a shutdown in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud and abuse. And there is that memo, as you mentioned, that says the government is ready to have mass firings if a deal isn't struck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Reductions in force, right. Well, we also know that the President took some extraordinary public statements in the past few days. He publicly said he wants to see Adam Schiff, now a senator, Letitia James prosecuted along with James Comey, the former FBI director who is now indicted. Yesterday, he twice posted on social media about former FBI Director Chris Wray. Did the President tell you, is he planning prosecutions?",
      "COSTA: I did not speak directly to the president about that today. But fishing around all weekend in his inner circle, it's clear, this is just the beginning in terms of possible prosecutions of those who have scrutinized the president or criticized him over the years. You mentioned the mortgage policy, potentially, of Senator Adam Schiff of California. He's being discussed inside of the Trump administration. So is Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, who sued the president over how he valued his real estate holdings. And there are others not even on our radar at this moment, like retired Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, who are being discussed as people who have, may have taken action against the administration or president in some way, allegedly, in the views of those inside. And they want to see the Justice Department hold them to account. There's such a gap right now in Washington. Republicans believe what President Trump is doing is accountability. Democrats are alarmed and see this as authoritarian government at work. And there's a real tension there that's not going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And a justice system that has to deal with evidence and facts.",
      "And we're going to talk about all of this ahead with some of our guests. Robert Costa, thank you very much for your reporting."

    "summary": "Denmark's defense ministry reported more drone sightings overnight Saturday into Sunday at several of its armed forces' locations.",
    "story": [
      "Denmark's defense ministry said Sunday that it had again observed drones at several of its armed forces' locations overnight, a day after the NATO alliance announced that it would enhance its vigilance in the Baltic Sea region.",
      "The ministry said in a statement that it had \"several capacities deployed\" after drone sightings from Saturday into Sunday night. It didn't offer any further details about the specifics of the deployment, the number of drones or locations.",
      "This is the latest unexplained drone activity after several sightings, including over five Danish airports last week, raising concerns about security in northern Europe amid suspected growing Russian aggression.",
      "Following a NATO meeting in Riga, Latvia, on Saturday, Col. Martin O'Donnell, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe spokesperson, announced that \"we will conduct even more enhanced vigilance with new multi-domain assets in the Baltic Sea region, which includes Denmark, under Baltic Sentry.\"",
      "He also said that NATO leaders were in constant contact with Danish officials following the drone sightings.",
      "As Denmark gears up for the upcoming European Union Summit in Copenhagen, the Danish transportation ministry said Sunday that \"all civilian drone flying in Danish airspace will be prohibited\" from Monday to Friday to \"remove the risk that enemy drones can be confused with legal drones and vice versa.\"",
      "\"We cannot accept that foreign drones create uncertainty and disturbances in society, as we have experienced recently. At the same time, Denmark will host EU leaders in the coming week, where we will have extra focus on security,\" Danish transportation minister Thomas Danielsen said in a statement.",
      "\"A violation of the prohibition can result in a fine or imprisonment for up to two years,\" according to the statement.",
      "The prohibition does not apply to military drone flights, drones used by state aviation, including police and emergency drone operations, as well as municipal and regional emergency and health-related drone operations.",
      "On Sunday afternoon, the Danish defense ministry announced that the German air defense frigate, FSG Hamburg, had arrived in Copenhagen.",
      "\"Here, the ship will contribute to strengthening Denmark's surveillance of the airspace in connection with the upcoming EU summit in Copenhagen,\" the ministry said in a statement. \"The German frigate is part of NATO's Baltic Sentry activity, which is intended to strengthen NATO's presence along the alliance's eastern flank.\"",
      "Separately, Germany said that following a request from Denmark, its armed forces would provide military support for the upcoming EU summit through \"Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems capabilities,\" also known as C-sUAS, which are detection systems that use radar, optical and acoustics technologies.",
      "Sweden had already announced earlier that it would \"lend Denmark a military anti-drone capability\" without giving further details.",
      "Tensions have been running high in Denmark in recent days following reports of drone activity, and hundreds of possible sightings reported by concerned citizens that couldn't officially be confirmed. Nonetheless, the public has been asked to report all suspicious activity to the police.",
      "Danish Minister of Justice Peter Hummelgaard said on Sept. 25 that the goal of the flyovers is to sow fear and division, adding that the country will seek additional ways to neutralize drones, including proposing legislation to allow infrastructure owners to shoot them down.",
      "It's not clear who is responsible for the drone activity. Danish authorities have not named the exact military locations where they have been seen.",
      "Drone sightings on Friday night took place at around 8:15 p.m. local time in Denmark and lasted for several hours, an officer on duty told AFP. The officer, Simon Skelsjaer, said police ad not shot down the drones and could not comment on their origins as police were working with the Danish military in their investigation into the incident, AFP reported.",
      "Danish authorities said sightings on Thursday appeared to be a \"hybrid attack,\" but they noted that there was no evidence indicating Moscow had orchestrated it, reported CBS partner BBC News. Denmark's prime minister and NATO's secretary-general said last week that Russian involvement couldn't be ruled out.",
      "The Russian Embassy in Denmark last week rejected claims of Moscow's involvement in the incidents.",
      "Speaking to Russian media in comments released Sunday, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that any attempt by NATO to shoot down Russian or Belarusian aircraft would be met with an \"immediate response.\"",
      "\"Let them try, let them shoot. Or they'll shoot down something Russian over Kaliningrad. Then, of course, we'll have to fight, as they say in Russia, with all we've got. Is that necessary? No,\" he said, asking whether NATO would shoot down his helicopter when flying close to the Polish border.",
      "The release of Lukashenko's comments came after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that his nation doesn't intend to attack Europe, but will mount a \"decisive response\" to any aggression.",
      "\"I think people will very much regret if they commit the most flagrant violation of our territorial integrity and territorial sovereignty,\" Lavrov said, including \"attempts to shoot down \u2026 any object in general over our territory, in our airspace.\"",

      "\"Today we welcome home Amir Amiry, an American who was wrongfully detained in Afghanistan,\" wrote Rubio in a social media post. \"I want to thank Qatar for helping secure his freedom.\"",
      "A source with knowledge of the release previously told CBS News that Qatari diplomats had coordinated with the office of the U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs to facilitate it. After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, Qatar signed an accord to represent U.S. interests in the country. Before Amiri, it had helped secure the release of four other American citizens from Afghanistan earlier this year.",
      "Amiri was detained in December 2024. Qatar began negotiating for his release in March, at first arranging a meeting between Amiri and the U.S. Special Envoy Adam Boehler during his visit to Afghanistan, according to the source with knowledge of his release. Qatari diplomats monitored Amiri's health and maintained close communication with U.S. officials throughout his detention, the source told CBS News.",
      "Negotiations persisted for several months until Qatar reached a breakthrough this weekend, which resulted in Amiri's release, the source said.",
      "Two American citizens were freed in a prisoner swap between the U.S. and the Taliban in January, one of whom, Ryan Corbett, had been abducted in 2022 while on a work trip. The Taliban agreed to release them from Afghanistan in exchange for Khan Mohammed, a Taliban figure who had been imprisoned for life in California on drug trafficking and terrorism charges, officials told the Associated Press at the time.",
      "Another two Americans were released from Afghanistan in March. Faye Hall, who had been detained earlier in the year on charges of using an unauthorized drone, was arrested with a British couple who remained in Taliban custody, sources told CBS News after Hall's release. The British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, were freed earlier this month. Separately, American\u00a0George Glezmann was also freed in March after being detained during a tourist visit to Afghanistan in 2022, in a move that the former U.S. envoy to Afghanistan called \"a goodwill gesture\" to President Trump by the Taliban.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Ty Cobb, who served as White House Special Counsel during President Trump's first term, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ty Cobb. He served as White House Special Counsel for just under a year during the first Trump administration, helping to coordinate the response to Robert Mueller's probe of Russian influence on the 2016 election. Good morning to you.",
      "FORMER WHITE HOUSE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT TY COBB: Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw this action against former FBI Director James Comey this past week, and he was indicted on two charges specific to his September 2020 testimony to Congress about Russian election meddling in 2016, so-called Crossfire Hurricane. In your view, from what you've heard of this case, do you think it has enough substance to actually head to trial?",
      "COBB: I don't, really. You know, as you and Senator Kaine discussed briefly, moments ago, that the grand jury rejected one of the counts, the top count, actually, in the indictment, approved two, but by a very slim margin, 14 out of 23 in a process where there's no defense attorney in the room, and the standard is merely probable cause. The next courtroom that this will be assessed in, if it gets to trial, requires unanimity from 12 people, and there will be a vigorous defense. I don't see any way in the world that, you know, Comey will be convicted. And I think there's a good chance, because of, you know, the wholly unconstitutional, authoritarian way that this was done, that the case may get tossed out well before trial.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wholly unconstitutional and authoritarian. That's- that's quite a description. You used to work for President Trump. What makes you now characterized his actions that way?",
      "COBB: I used to work- well, I used to work at the White House as as a lawyer, you know, interacting with the Justice Department in the Mueller investigation and other matters, and I was not Trump's personal lawyer. So, my role was really, you know, as a- as a government employee, and not personal to the- to the president. He did have personal lawyers, but, you know, at the time, you know, I was trying to perform the duties that were assigned to me. In this- in this circumstance, you know, I'm eight years removed from that. I don't- I don't have any allegiances or reasons to, you know, say anything other than balls and strikes. And former Attorney General Jackson, Justice Jackson, Nuremberg Prosecutor, himself, highlighted in 1940 that the most important thing at the Justice Department when he was Attorney General was that people not target individuals, that they merely pursue crimes. Griffin Bell, years later, 1978 said essentially the same thing. Emphasized how political- politics and favor have no business at the Justice Department. It's all about even-handedness. And I think we talked about the misrepresentations that Attorney General Bondi made about how she would proceed even-handedly, and, you know, she's wholly abandoned that and is now merely doing the President's bidding when he says, prosecute my enemies, now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Well, the New York Times is reporting that half a dozen US Attorney's Offices have been ordered to draft plans to investigate a group funded by George Soros, who is a democratic donor. You look at that, you look at the list of names of others who the President has said he specifically wants to be prosecuted or investigated. I'll read a few of them to you: Two former Trump officials, Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor. He also said he wants a federal investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith, the DOJ fired the 35 lawyers who were involved in the January 6th and classified documents cases. The Justice Department is now going after Fulton County DA Fani Willis' travel records. We have quite an exhaustive list here. What is the pattern you see?",
      "COBB: Well, I think if you go to 30,000 feet, what you see is a lot of moving parts, but simple themes. The simple themes are rewriting history. Trump wants to rewrite history so that, you know, the next generation may not know that he incited a violent insurrection, refused to peacefully transfer the power of the presidency after losing an election, stole classified documents and showed them to friends and- and guests at Mar-a-Lago, you know, and that he was a criminal. I mean, he's a convicted felon. All- all anybody involved in those events that offended him, they're- they're in real danger. So, you have the rewriting history stuff. You know, the US attorney that he appointed, his personal lawyer, Lindsay Halligan. You know her, her role previously in the administration was, you know, trying to eliminate the theory that, you know, America had slaves at the Smithsonian. She was there to, you know, whitewash the- the Smithsonian and paint America- paint America is something that- that it isn't. I mean, America needs to learn from the mistakes and lessons that we've had, and one of the biggest mistakes that- that America ever had was re-electing President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a number of Republican lawmakers are declining to speak out and are leaving the door open that these cases are legitimate. Do you think that the judicial system can resist what you are saying here as just simply politically motivated pressure?",
      "COBB: I think that's an excellent question. I think, you know, the founders, when they- when they drafted the Constitution, Article One is to Congress, and Congress has the greatest powers under the Constitution; spending power, war power, impeachment. Congress is really there to check the presidency. Congress has been neutered by the cowardice of the Republicans. Mike Johnson won't even seat recently elected representative Grijalva because he doesn't want her to tip the balance on the- on the Epstein vote. Congress is totally in the tank and --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, I'm gonna have to cut you off. I'm sorry, because we're out of time there. Ty Cobb, thank you for your time. We'll be right back."

      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thanks. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about Ukraine, which you just returned from, but before I do that, let's button up where we left the conversation with Senator Klobuchar. FBI Director Chris Wray was twice spoken about in public statements by the President yesterday, and he said he has some explaining to do. He seemed to be connecting it to the FBI and January 6th. Are you at all concerned by the former director's actions?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I do think that there- you know, with this new information, there's going to have to be some explaining as to what 6th- what is this new information, and how does this relate to January?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, the number of the agents? That 274 --",
      "REP. TURNER: Yes. This does seem to be significantly different than what anyone has heard before, and how does this relate to the circumstances of what occurred there. Certainly, Kash Patel, as he's bringing this forward, this is going to be information that I think does relate. It really does go to everyone's confidence of what we currently know about that day. There's been a number of investigations, and a number of people who've looked at this. You know, this certainly is concerning. And I think you know it is better --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what part is concerning, because that inspector general report said months ago that there were several 100 FBI agents who responded after the Capitol Police asked him to be there?",
      "REP. TURNER: But it's the issue of, you know, what was- what- what was their role? What did they do? You know, that aspect, I think certainly. As we look at this information, as the FBI looks at the information, is it the same? Is it the same information that has been looked at before, or is it different? And that certainly bears review, and that, I think, will occur.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when the President says Chris Wray has some explaining to do, how do you interpret that? Because the Inspector General report is public. Kash Patel said those individuals were there. It's not standard to send them, but it was disclosed they were there at the Capitol.",
      "REP. TURNER: I mean, obviously, the current FBI Director, and the FBI is going to have to come forward with the information. That information will be reviewed, and then, ultimately, the FBI is going to have to- and I think that the prior director will have to explain how this information relates to what we've looked at before. And it's either going to be the same and prove that it is as everyone believed the circumstances were before, or it's going to be different. And, at that point, we're going to have to look at, you know, how does it relate to what we believe we knew, and how does it relate to what we now see, what we don't know. Because I have no information, I think no one else has any additional information besides what the news reports are, and we'll have to review what that information is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to be very clear, because it is such a dangerous information environment in so many ways, you are not in any way suggesting that the FBI was secretly agitating, which is what the president said the attack on January 6th?",
      "REP. TURNER: I'm not suggesting anything, and I don't think you are either. I think what we're both suggesting is that this currently is in news reports, and those news reports certainly bear a review of the information that's going to come forward, and that information is either going to tell us that it's the same information that has been seen before, or it's going to be new information. And if it's new information that's going to need to be reviewed.",

      "((COMMERCIAL BREAK))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return now to our conversation with Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Congressman, we were showing video there earlier of the overnight attack Russia carried out against Ukraine. You were just there, in Kyiv. I'm sure you welcomed what the President said this week, when he said he now has changed his mind, and he does believe Ukraine could win this war and get its territory back from Russia. But he also added he wishes everyone well when he made that statement. So is he telling us that the United States is walking away from Ukraine and leaving it up to them, or is he signaling that the United States is going to help Ukraine win that territory back?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, we definitely need to help. And this is part of the dirty secret that really where the United States really needs to step it up, and it's part of the meeting that he had with the president of the EU Commission. You know, the United States is providing aid to Ukraine. But, at the same time, the West, the EU, and the United States is subsidizing Russia and its production machine, because, you know, we're buying from China and India that is buying energy from Russia, and the EU is buying energy from Russia. So we need to place sanctions on Russia so that we're not funding their economy, which is funding their ability to attack and kill Ukraine. So we're funding both sides of this. Unfortunate- unfortunately, there are those in Congress that want to stop supporting Ukraine's ability to defend themselves. Well, that'll just result in more attacks from Russia, as we saw last night, against Ukraine. That's not going to get us to peace. The only way to get us to peace, and Trump's vision of peace, is to impact their ability for production, to stop subsidizing Russia's economy and their ability for production and killing Ukrainians, and that's to adopt Lindsey Graham and Brian Fitzpatrick's bill that would impose sanctions. Give the President the ability to impact Russia's ability to wage this war and get us to peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Speaker Johnson has said before that he would put that bill to a vote, he just hasn't. And he has said, oh, I need the president to green light it. That's not true. He has a veto-proof majority. We've had Senator Graham on this program a million times telling us this is set to go, just give us the green light. Did Speaker Johnson respond to your request to move?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, and he's- the momentum is here, we need to do this now. The President doesn't need to give us a green light. He's not a red light. The last time that- and we and we're coming back, and we need to do so, we need to do so now. The last time we put on the floor the bill that would have stopped funding Ukraine, over 300 members voted for it. If we put the bill on the floor to stop the- to put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their economy, it would be similar. Over 300 members would vote for it. The only way to peace is to put sanctions on Russia, continue our support for Ukraine, which is what we're doing, what the President is going to be doing, and bring this war to an end. Support Trump's vision of peace. Put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their- their war economy. Now, what I saw in Ukraine, which is what's really incredible, is that they are winning modern warfare. What they're doing with their anti-drone technology, I mean, they are really the tech bros of the future. They are implementing on the front line, anti-drone air defense technology that is winning this war with our help and assistance, which they're going to continue to need for the long-range systems that Russia is bringing in and that are attacking Kyiv with. But what their anti-drone technology that no one else has, that they are implementing. They are winning this war. We need to be on the side of that war of the future that they're winning and support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I've heard military officials explain this to me that this is like a really interesting test case to learn the lessons that Ukraine is illustrating for the world. However, in the immediate term, will the President lift restrictions on Ukraine's ability to use long-range weapons to actually attack Russia?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, and he really needs to do so, because what's happening with that pressure that's on the front line \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he has the old Biden policy.",
      "REP. TURNER: Right, well, he does, and that's what he needs to release, because with the pressure on the front line and the fact that Ukraine has developed anti-drone technology, where they're taking down Russian drones, they're using their own drones to attack Russia, but Russia has long-range weapons that they're attacking that front line. Ukraine needs to have the ability to use long-range weapons to push Russia back. And when they're able to do that, they will get their territory back. If they are able to do that, they will win this war. And if we put sanctions on Russia, impacting their ability to produce their war machine and production, they will be able to win this modern warfare, and will be on the right side of what- this is not old-time war. This is modern war, and we're being on the right side of Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've just got to persuade President Trump to do that- that change in policy. When we were in France last week speaking to President Macron, I asked him about those incursions into European airspace, some would say by Russian drones or Russian jets, others have said they still need to investigate. We've seen drones or jets into Poland, Estonia, Romania, Norway, possibly Denmark. What should the United States be doing to push back on those provocations?",
      "REP. TURNER: You know, what's interesting about this is it? What we've always said is that, you know, Russia, once they got through Ukraine, would be testing and go- can continue into Europe. But what they're seeing- but what they're seeing now, because they're having this- this success of Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine. They're now going into Poland and Romania, and they're seeing that Poland and Romania don't have the advanced technology that Ukraine does, and instead of going through Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine since- since this is Modern Warfare, and Ukraine is winning it, they're seeing that the old war is actually old Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike Turner, thank you for sharing some of your insights, what you learned on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "REP TURNER: Thank you,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back in a moment. So stay with us."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who joins us this morning from Richmond. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have what, 140,000 federal civilian workers in your state, one of the highest numbers in the nation. How concerned are you that you will see mass layoffs if we go into the shutdown that the White House says they are preparing for?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, and I think your reporter Robert Costa said they're even welcoming it. We are really worried about it, Margaret. When Ted Cruz forced a shutdown of the government in October 2013, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And when Donald Trump forced a shutdown of the government in late 2018, early 2019 it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And this one would be the same. The only thing about the President's threat to fire more people is he's already doing it, and instead of threatening, he should just be meeting to negotiate. We came near shut down deadlines during the Biden administration, but we never shut government down because the President would sit down with congressional leaders of both parties and would find a path forward. And that's what we've been asking for since the Democrats put an alternate plan on the table on September 18, just sit down and talk with us, and finally, he has agreed to do that tomorrow. But if you're reporting, is to be believed, he's sort of going into it, setting reducing expectations improperly. He should be doing what presidents do and saying, we're going to find a deal to keep the government of the greatest nation on earth open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it enough of a deal to say, take the short term, seven week funding deal, and we'll continue to talk about these health care subsidies that Democrats say they are so concerned about. I mean, is it really worth the risk?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Here's, here's my thought about this, Margaret. And this is my personal view. We've got to solve this health care issue. And Republicans are saying the same thing. Mike Johnson has said it. Senator Cornyn has said it, Senator Hawley has said it. Senator Murkowski has said it. We're asking to fix a problem that even Republicans want to fix. I don't think we have to have every detail pinned down with all the Is dotted and Ts crossed in order to do a short term extension, but I do want to see that Republicans are saying, You're right. We can fix this, and here's the path to finding a fix. And the second thing we need, which is so reasonable, we're just asking, if we do a deal, please don't, Mr. President, sign the deal, and then immediately the next day start, starting to take away funds, rescinding agreements that you just made yesterday. A deal should be a deal, and we should all agree that Americans should not see their health care suffer, their premiums spike, and people lose insurance and providers close. We've already had providers in Virginia announce that they are closing their doors because of the bill that the Republicans passed in July, and this is happening all over the country. Let's just do what's right by our constituents and fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you another question specific to Virginia, and that is, what is going on inside the judicial system. Back in August, it was the US Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, Todd Gilbert, who suddenly resigned. Then earlier this month, the US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Eric Siebert resigned after failing to bring a case against New York's Attorney General, Letitia James. What is going on here in the Virginia court system? Margaret?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: It's pretty darn plain the President nominated two U.S. attorneys in Virginia, both with Republican bona fides. Todd Gilbert in the Western District, had been the Republican Speaker of our house of delegates. He resigned as a legislator to take the Trump appointment. President Trump's team interviewed these candidates, approved the candidates, nominated the candidates, and then even appointed them into the interim position. But both were forced out because they said their integrity as prosecutors would not allow them to genuflect to Donald Trump. And in Todd Gilbert's case, they wanted to force him to demote a long time career member of the Western District of Virginia who had served under multiple administrations and presidents. He refused to do so. And in Eric Siebert's case, he refused to bring a criminal charge against a perceived Trump political opponent when there was no evidence to support the charge. President Trump is spending time going after enemies, trying to figure out a way to give $20 billion to a friend, the Argentine Government, instead of dealing with the challenges we elected him to confront. Food prices are going up. Building supplies are going up. School supplies are going up. Energy costs are going up, health care costs are going up, and Donald Trump seems to be focused on a retribution campaign. You got to focus, man, this is an important job. It's time to focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to those Virginia cases, have you talked to Siebert, have you talked to Gilbert to understand why they felt they had to resign?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: I have talked to each of them after the resignations were done. These were individuals I knew both. I knew Todd Gilbert because of his legislative role, and I knew Eric Siebert very well by reputation. And again, this was the prosecutor Margaret, who, when the Biden administration transitioned to the Trump administration, the Trump administration DOJ put him in the role as an interim even before we recommended him, along with our republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, as you mentioned. So after they had been fired, yes, I did call and say I'd like to understand why you were forced out, and they shared thoughts with me without getting into anything about particular cases or particular communication they'd had with Trump administration officials. But I am convinced, and Virginians are convinced. I traveled around the state this week. People are talking about this. Both of these individuals had a backbone. They wouldn't genuflect to Donald Trump, and they wouldn't bring baseless cases, and we shouldn't see that in any district in this nation. And it's sad that President Trump is more focused on retribution than serving his constituents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that Eastern District did come forward with this, this indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Yes, it was just a two page indictment, no evidence presented publicly here, but it was convincing enough to 14 of 23 people sitting on a grand jury. Can you really say there's no there there?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, a bare majority, as you know, Margaret, there's 23 people on a grand jury. They need at least 12 votes to get an indictment, and yes, they got their finger over the bar with 14, although the four- the 23 wouldn't agree on one of the charges that the US attorney was pushing. So we will see what this case is about. It is odd that the indictment has so few facts, and I found it very odd. I used to practice in this court, and when the Attorney General put out a press statement after the indictment and said, we will follow the facts in this case. What prosecutors follow the facts before they indict, they don't indict, and then say, well, let's see what the facts are. I think she even revealed that this is a weak case, which everyone in her office was telling her it was a weak case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You in your armed services role. I want to quickly ask you, you have said you are supportive of the creation of a Palestinian state, and we saw at the UN this past week, a large number of members just simply walked out when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke, it was a statement tomorrow he's going to be at the White House ahead of that meeting, President Trump said this:",
      "VO SOT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There's been enough. It's time to stop now, okay?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a strong statement. Do you know how the United States should enforce that? How do you force Israel to step back from annexation?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, I was very heartened that the President said that, and you're right. I support what the United States voted for in the UN in 1947 a state of Israel and a state of Palestine. One of those promises has been met. One hasn't, and we need to be on a path for a Palestinian state that's demilitarized, where Hamas plays no role in its governance. And until we find that path forward, we're going to have continued cycles of violence that are bad for Israelis, bad for Palestinians, bad for the region. So I hope the president, who, by all accounts, has a strong relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu, makes plain that we are, we are against annexation, and this 21 point proposal that the President has on the table, which is pretty similar to the New York dialog being led by the French and the Saudis. They're different efforts, but they're trying to reach the same point, a future state for Israel and Palestine, where both can live in peace, and creating stability in the region instead of the cycles of violence. So I hope the president leans into that at the meeting tomorrow. I was heartened by his comment. It would be a big mistake for the Prime Minister Netanyahu to look at all of these nations that have been allies, saying you need to change course, and for him to just pull his head in the shell and turn inward and continue to isolate Israel, rather than move forward toward peace and more stability in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kaine, thank you for your insights today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Thanks, Margaret, great to be on again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we just heard from my colleague, Robert Costa that the President indicated to him the likelihood of a shutdown, and with that, potentially mass firings. Do you think this is posturing, or do you worry your fellow Democrats are walking into a trap?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I am glad the president has finally agreed to meet with the leadership in Congress. He canceled the meeting last week, which I think was a big mistake, because this is an opportunity for the country because of one big problem. And that is that the Republicans have created a health care crisis. My constituents, Americans are standing on a cliff right now with these insurance premium increases that are upon them. So Democrats are united in pushing on this and saying, look, let us do something about this crisis before it is too late. Seventy five percent increase in premiums starting November 1, on people who are small business owners, people who are farmers out there, twice as much in the rural areas. So that's what this is about to us, and the President prides himself in the art of a deal, this is the moment for him to meet with Democrats and come to an agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those premiums go up November 1. You're talking about the extension of the health care subsidies, but insurance companies plan that year out, so these premiums are already priced in here. Why not agree to--",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --Margaret, what we know is that these tax--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --government--",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --If I could just, okay, go ahead, the tax credits are what really could make a difference here for people, because of the fact that we know these premiums hit November 1. Getting this done now is a now thing. It's not a December thing. It's not a January thing. It's not an off ramp. It is something we have to get done now. As one of my farmers that I met with out in rural Minnesota said, when looking at the President's tariffs and looking at what's happened in farm country, five-year high in small farm bankruptcy, he said it's a perfect storm of ugly. That's where we are with the economy right now. And that's why we are pushing on what is one of the biggest cost drivers for Americans, in addition to groceries and electricity prices going up, it's health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, you couldn't take the seven week funding and then negotiate that, you're saying it has to be agreed to right now.",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: We believe this is a now problem, and while we are eager to talk with Senator Thune, I know Senator Schumer is to get this moving, in the end, we know that they are rubber stamped for what the President wants. Not everyone is like Rand Paul going off in his own direction and talking about the debt out of the \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\" I don't agree with a lot of what he says, but he's right about that debt. He's right about what happened with that bill, most of them are just going to rubber stamp what President Trump says. That's why it was so important to get this meeting, and I hope he sees it, not as the president, not as political theater, but as real people who are facing a crisis right now, whether it's in the cities, the suburbs or the rural areas of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sit on the Judiciary Committee. So I want to ask you about what's happening right now. Earlier this month, the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert resigned after failing to bring a case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. We just spoke about her with Robert Costa. Monday, Lindsey Halligan was sworn in as the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. She has never prosecuted a case before. Three days into this new job, she moved forward with the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on two counts. Have you spoken to your fellow Republicans on the Judiciary Committee? Do they have concerns about what's happening in Virginia?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Well, I plan on doing that this week. And what I see, this as a former prosecutor myself, this is weaponizing the Justice Department, basically taking a career prosecutor who was recommended by the Republican governor of the state of Virginia, clearly has Republican roots, who made a decision based on the evidence over a period of months, made a decision. Then he's pushed out, forced out, so that the President can install his own aid into the job. When I questioned Attorney General Bondi during her confirmation hearing, she assured me that politics would not play a role that they would make independent decisions. That is not what this is. This is a vengeance prosecution. It is not about the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You also worked on investigating January 6, 2021, and the attack of the United States Capitol. FBI director, Kash Patel. Yesterday said publicly 274 FBI agents were quote, \"thrown into crowd control on that day against FBI standards.\" President Trump also said publicly that FBI agents acted as agitators who were secretly placed against all rules, regulations, protocols and standards into the crowd prior to and during the attack. This contradicts what the Inspector General said in a published report that said there was no evidence of undercover employees in the crowd, and that there were hundreds of special agents and employees who came in after the Capitol Hill police asked for them. This is now newly in focus, because the President put the focus there, what was the role of the FBI that day?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I chaired the investigation of the security problems, along a bipartisan investigation with Senator Peters and then Senator Blunt and Senator Portman. This went on. We had a number of open hearings, and we made major, major recommendations for changes at the Capitol and nowhere was it found that the FBI was acting as agitators. In fact, they were called in when there was such a delay in bringing in the military to insist- to assist in what was essentially an insurrection, where over 100 police officers were injured or maimed because of this criminal activity at the Capitol. So I just find it appalling that the President would say that the FBI was somehow part of this. Kash Patel did clarify that in fact, they were brought in after the fact, but they were brought in because we needed help. Senators, Republicans and Democrats were calling the military leaders. They were calling the Attorney General. They were asking for help because that help was not coming to the Capitol. And everyone has seen those facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your insight there. We'll be watching what happens here, as the President tweeted both of those things, and in reference to former director Chris Wray, we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us."

      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to start on that news you just heard, that the President is basically expecting a shutdown and possibly to carry out these mass layoffs. Do you think all of this is just a threat to make Democrats fold?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, I think both sides have to look at the proposals for spending and decide, you know, what is the best way forward for the country. The Republican proposal adds about $2 trillion in debt over the next year, so it'll be short $2 trillion. So I oppose the Republican plan because it adds debt. The Democrat plan would add $3 trillion in debt. So really, both plans are laden with deficit spending, and I think that's the biggest problem that our country faces. So I've actually proposed an alternative. I proposed a penny plan, which would cut a little bit across the board, and my plan would balance over about five years, we got a vote on mine last week, and 36 Republicans supported it, 16 didn't and no Democrats did. So my plan didn't pass either, but the plan that I would support would be a plan that reduces spending and reduces deficit spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we have this immediate deadline, though, of this week, and we know leaders are going to the White House. If we end up in this shutdown. Do you think it is appropriate and illegal for the executive to carry out the kind of mass firings that the budget director laid out in that memo this past week?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, there's been several cases adjudicated now all the way to the Supreme Court, and the President seems to have won every one of them on his ability to hire and fire within the executive branch. And I think this is understandable, because in the executive branch if the president can't fire him, who can? and so I think the President has a great out",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Without consulting congress?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Over executive branch employees- for hiring and firing people in the executive branch? I think he has a great deal of leeway. The court has upheld this repeatedly, and so I suspect they will, even when Congress- you know, the Democrats try to protect this agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Board, and they say, well, the funding will come from the Fed. You won't get to vote on the funding, and the person hired can't be fired. Well, he did fire that person in 2020 and the courts upheld that in 2021, in the Supreme Court, and really since then, every case he has won. And as you know, I'm a equal parts critic of both Republicans and Democrats. I've criticized Trump on things, but the one thing is on the hiring and firing. I think he's going to win every one of those cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your role in Homeland Security. You are chairman of that oversight committee. The President announced yesterday, and I'm sure you saw his social media post, that he's going to send troops to Portland, Oregon. He called it a 'war ravaged' city. He said he's also going to send troops to any immigration facilities around the country which are, quote, 'under siege from attack by antifa, and other domestic terrorists.' End quote. He said he's authorizing full force if necessary. Do you know what full force means here? Do you know what's in store?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think he has the legal authority to send troops to protect federal buildings and federal proceedings such as courts, and that's been around since Civil Rights Era. We've acknowledged that the federal government will sometimes come in despite what states say. I do think it's better when the states agree to it. For example, I mean, in Chicago- Chicago is a nightmare. It is literally a war zone, and the people being hurt, the worst are those who are poor and living in these communities. I've been to the most dangerous precinct in Chicago, and it's just despair and sadness and these young boys are growing up with no families\u2013",
      "[CROSSTALK STARTS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you haven't been briefed on the plans for Oregon?",
      "SEN. PAUL: There's no restaurants, no drugs- excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you haven't been briefed on plans to send troops to Oregon?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Not for Portland, no.",
      "[CROSSTALK ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because we have not yet seen troops in Chicago, though you're referencing the President's past threats to do so. In Oregon, the governor said there's no need, and they don't want these troops, but the mayor said- the mayor of Portland, federal agents have been arriving along with some armored vehicles. Are you comfortable with pushing the limits here of some of these uses of either potentially troops or federal agents.",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think both the people in Portland and across America have to decide about this. You know, we had anarchy in Portland for like, six months or a year. The city didn't even control large swaths of the city. These had federal buildings on them, and so I think there is a role for the federal government. Am I excited about it? No. I'd prefer not to have troops in our cities, or I'd prefer them only to come, you know, with the acceptance of the local authorities. But I do think there is a role if the states will not step up. Portland did not step up, and they let their city go, you know, they let it burn for goodness sakes, and then they let a whole area become the city, you know, these blocks of anarchy where some sort of local thug rule was a- was- was going on. So I don't know, I think ultimately what's going to happen. And I think some of this is the President showing the politics of Republicans versus Democrats is eventually cities like Chicago and Portland are going to give up on Democrats because their people are dying. It's their people in their community. The people have been supporting the Democrat party for decade after decade. They are the ones dying. It's not the people in the rich neighborhoods that are country club Republican, it's the poor people in every city is dying. Well, you know the cities have to step up on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm asking about your oversight role, because it seemed like the President's statement yesterday, it took a turn. It wasn't how he talked about Chicago. In fact, when he was speaking in this social media post about Portland, he used language here about domestic terrorists. And we know just a few days ago, the President did issue that executive order saying he wanted to declare this anti fascist group, antifa, to be a domestic terrorist organization. Have you seen evidence that these left wing activists are now becoming a more organized group with national leadership, something the FBI has said in the past, that they're really more of an ideology?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think you lose the description as activists once you start wielding weapons, and you show up with helmets and you're breaking windows. That's what was going on apparently in Portland, at the ICE building. I do think, though, that it's important when people start talking about labeling people, that we realize everybody, the worst among us, even those accused of heinous crimes, will get due process. So we can't single out a group and say, oh, they're not going to get due process because we're calling them terrorists. So I'd be careful of the labels, but I'm absolutely for going after the people wielding clubs and sticks and fighting with the police and trying to get into the federal buildings. They have to be punished, and they will be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you have concerns about designating groups with these anti-government sentiments as domestic terrorist groups. I mean, do you start worrying about Fourth Amendment violations?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I don't know that it's helpful to label groups, particularly since antifa, there are some real people in antifa, they're real violent people, but it is an amorphous group in the sense that I don't think they have a president, they don't have a local chapter. It is more an ideology. And it was useful, maybe around the world, to call things terrorism. But there's different rules of engagement. When we have to go after terrorist in the Middle East, we send- we send a Hellfire missile or a drone, often. In the United States, it's much tricker to be a police. I have a great deal of respect for our police because you're right. They have to respect the Fourth Amendment, the First Amendment, and so we have to be careful with labels, but that doesn't mean we should go soft on antifa and these people that are committing violence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator Rand Paul, thank you for your time this morning, 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute. Stay with us."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-nations-hits-iran-snapback-sanctions-nuclear-program/",
    "published": "Sat, 27 Sep 2025 22:53:48 -0400",
    "summary": "The sanctions will again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran, and penalize any development of Iran's ballistic missile program, among other measures.",
    "story": [
      "The United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran early Sunday over its nuclear program, further squeezing the Islamic Republic as its people increasingly find themselves priced out of the food they need to survive and worried about their futures.",
      "The sanctions will again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran, and penalize any development of Iran's ballistic missile program, among other measures. It came via a mechanism known as \"snapback,\" included in Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, and comes as Iran's economy already is reeling.",
      "Iran's rial currency sits at a record low, increasing pressure on food prices and making daily life that much more challenging. That includes meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table.",
      "Meanwhile, people worry about a new round of fighting between Iran and Israel \u2014 as well as potentially the U.S. \u2014 as missile sites struck during the 12-day war in June now appear to be being rebuilt.",
      "Activists fear a rising wave of repression within the Islamic Republic, which already has reportedly executed more people this year than over the past three decades.",
      "Sina, the father of a 12-year-old boy who spoke on condition that only his first name be used for fear of repercussions, said the country has never faced such a challenging time, even during the deprivations of the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and the decades of sanctions that came later.",
      "\"For as long as I can remember, we've been struggling with economic hardship, and every year it's worse than the last,\" Sina told The Associated Press. \"For my generation, it's always either too late or too early \u2014 our dreams are slipping away.\"",
      "Snapback was designed to be veto-proof at the U.N. Security Council, meaning China and Russia could not stop it alone, as they have other proposed actions against Tehran in the past. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called them a \"trap\" for Iran on Saturday.",
      "France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered snapback over Iran 30 days ago for its further restricting monitoring of its nuclear program and the deadlock over its negotiations with the U.S.",
      "Iran further withdrew from the International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring after Israel's war with the country in June, which also saw the U.S. strike nuclear sites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, the country still maintains a stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90% \u2014 that is largely enough to make several atomic bombs, should Tehran choose to rush toward weaponization.",
      "Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and IAEA say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003.",
      "The three European nations on Sunday said they \"continuously made every effort to avoid triggering snapback.\" But Iran \"has not authorized IAEA inspectors to regain access to Iran's nuclear sites, nor has it produced and transmitted to the IAEA a report accounting for its stockpile of high-enriched uranium.\"",
      "Tehran has further argued that the three European nations shouldn't be allowed to implement snapback, pointing in part to America's unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, during the first term of President Trump's administration.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised the three European nations for \"an act of decisive global leadership\" for imposing the sanctions on Iran and said \"diplomacy is still an option.\"",
      "\"For that to happen, Iran must accept direct talks,\" Rubio said.",
      "However, it remains unclear how Tehran will respond Sunday.",
      "\"The Trump administration appears to think it has a stronger hand post-strikes, and it can wait for Iran to come back to the table,\" said Kelsey Davenport, a nuclear expert at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. \"Given the knowledge Iran has, given the materials that remain in Iran, that's a very dangerous assumption.\"",
      "Risks also remain for Iran as well, she added: \"In the short term, kicking out the IAEA increases the risk of miscalculation. The U.S. or Israel could use the lack of inspections as a pretext for further strikes.\"",
      "The aftermath of the June war drove up food prices in Iran, putting already expensive meat out of reach for poorer families.",
      "Iran's government put overall annual inflation at 34.5% in June, and its Statistical Center reported that the cost of essential food items rose over 50% over the same period. But even that doesn't reflect what people see at shops. Pinto beans tripled in price in a year, while butter nearly doubled. Rice, a staple, rose more than 80% on average, hitting 100% for premium varieties. Whole chicken is up 26%, while beer and lamb are up 9%.",
      "\"Every day I see new higher prices for cheese, milk and butter,\" said Sima Taghavi, a mother of two, at a Tehran grocery. \"I cannot omit them like fruits and meat from my grocery list because my kids are too young to be deprived.\"",
      "The pressure over food and fears about the war resuming have seen more patients heading to psychologists since June, local media in Iran have reported.",
      "\"The psychological pressure from the 12-day war on the one hand, and runaway inflation and price hikes on the other, has left society exhausted and unmotivated,\" Dr. Sima Ferdowsi, a clinical psychologist and professor at Shahid Beheshti University, told the Hamshahri newspaper in an interview published in July.",
      "Iran has faced multiple nationwide protests in recent years, fueled by anger over the economy, demands for women's rights and calls for the country's theocracy to change.",
      "In response to those protests and the June war, Iran has been putting prisoners to death at a pace unseen since 1988, when it executed thousands at the end of the Iran-Iraq war. The Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights and the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran put the number of people executed in 2025 at over 1,000, noting the number could be higher as Iran does not report on each execution.",

      "Trump and Netanyahu are scheduled to meet Monday, and Trump said on social media Friday that \"very inspired and productive discussions\" and \"intense negotiations\" about Gaza are ongoing with countries in the region.",
      "Israel is pressing ahead with another major ground operation in Gaza City, which experts say is experiencing famine. More than 300,000 people have fled, but up to 700,000 are still there, many because they can't afford to relocate.",
      "Hospitals are short on supplies and targeted by airstrikes",
      "The strikes Saturday morning demolished a house in Gaza City's Tufah neighborhood, killing at least 11 people, more than half of them women and children, according to Al-Ahly Hospital, where the bodies were brought. Four other people were killed when an airstrike hit their homes in the Shati refugee camp, according to Shifa Hospital. Six other Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire while seeking aid in southern and central Gaza, according to the Nasser and Al Awda hospitals.",
      "Hospitals and health clinics in Gaza City are on the brink of collapse. Nearly two weeks into the offensive, two clinics have been destroyed by airstrikes, two hospitals shut down after being damaged and others are barely functioning, with medicine, equipment, food and fuel in short supply, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "Many patients and staff have been forced to flee hospitals, leaving behind only a few doctors and nurses to tend to children in incubators or other patients too ill to move.",
      "On Friday, aid group Doctors Without Borders said it was forced to suspend activities in Gaza City. The group said Israeli tanks were less than half a mile from its health care facilities and the escalating attacks have created an \"unacceptable level of risk\" for its staff.",
      "Meanwhile, the food situation in the north has also worsened, as Israel has halted aid deliveries through its crossing into northern Gaza since Sept. 12 and has increasingly rejected U.N. requests to bring supplies from southern Gaza into the north, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.",
      "Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 people and wounded more than 167,000 others, Gaza's Health Ministry said.

The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but U.N. agencies and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.",
      "Israel's campaign was triggered when Hamas-led terrorists stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

      "The department said on social media\u00a0Friday that Petro \"stood on a NYC street and urged U.S. soldiers to disobey orders and incite violence. We will revoke Petro's visa due to his reckless and incendiary actions.\"",
      "Petro was visiting for the annual U.N. General Assembly. During a nearby protest Friday over the war in Gaza, he said \"I ask all the soldiers of the United States' army, don't point your rifles against humanity\" and \"disobey the orders of Trump.\"",
      "Petro returned to Colombia on Saturday as intended, in accordance with a Sept. 18 decree on the delegation of powers during his absence. He said on X that he found out about his visa status upon his arrival.",
      "The State Department did not answer questions about whether the revocation would affect future visits.",

      "Petro, who has a history of speaking off the cuff in meandering, ideologically charged speeches, also said on social media that \"I don't care\" about the punishment because he is also a European citizen. That means he does not need a visa to travel to the U.S.",
      "Colombia broke diplomatic ties with Israel last year over the Israel-Hamas war. Petro has repeatedly described Israel's siege of Gaza as genocide.",

The White House has offered scant information about how the operations came together or the legal authorities under which they were carried out.",
      "Earlier this year, Petro resisted deportation flights using American military aircraft, leading to a diplomatic crisis as Trump threatened to retaliate with higher tariffs and visa suspensions. The U.S. is Colombia's largest trading partner, and Petro's government relented, saying it would accept the planes.",
      "The U.S. accused Colombia earlier this month of failing to cooperate with anti-narcotics efforts. Although the designation did not include sanctions that would have slashed U.S. assistance to the country, it was a sharp rebuke that frustrated Petro.",

      "Zohran Mamdani, the leading New York City mayoral candidate who has been branded as a \"communist\" by GOP critics, criticized former Gov. Andrew Cuomo's \"record of disgrace\" on Monday, framing a two-person race for Gracie Mansion on the heels of Mayor Eric Adams suspending his reelection campaign.",

      "\"We are talking about someone whose life was upended because of Andrew Cuomo's decision to cut $65 million from the Advantage program,\" Mamdani said on Monday. \"$65 million in a state budget of more than a $100 billion. Today, it's more than $252 billion to make that decision. The cruelty that is at the heart of that decision is what New Yorkers want to turn the page on.\"",

      "\"This is a moot issue that happened 14 years ago \u2013 when Mamdani was in college \u2013 amid a $10 billion shortfall and that funding has been replaced and increased many times over through other rental assistance programs,\" Cuomo's campaign explained in a statement to Fox News Digital.",

Even if all 8% of Adams' supporters voted for Cuomo this November, the former governor would still be trailing by at least 10 points, according to the Fox News survey.",
      "\"Too often we think of homelessness as if it is natural, as if it is innate,\" Mamdani said. \"It's a political choice, and this is one example of the choices that has been made time and time again by someone like Andrew Cuomo, thinking that they would never have to make a decision in Albany and then explain it to the people of New York City.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how the technology is changing how the world operates on 'Special Report.'",
      "A New Jersey school district has adopted artificial intelligence to help detect weapons and stop threats before they escalate. The Glassboro Public School District has become the first in the country to combine AI gun detection with a mass communication system that speeds up emergency responses and reduces the time it takes to notify law enforcement.",

      "NORTH KOREAN HACKERS USE AI TO FORGE MILITARY IDS",
      "What's new in school security",
      "The district is using ZeroEyes, an AI video analytics platform that integrates with existing security cameras. The software scans for visible firearms and sends an alert whenever a potential threat appears. A team of military and law enforcement veterans at a 24/7 operations center then reviews the image to confirm whether the gun is real. Once verified, the system pushes an alert to school staff and police within three to five seconds. At the same time, buildings go into lockdown automatically.",
      "South Jersey schools have deployed AI to spot weapons and alert police in seconds. (Jay Janner/The Austin American-Statesman via Getty Images)",
      "These alerts are distributed through Singlewire Software's InformaCast platform. This system can send warnings across school PA systems, strobe lights, digital signs, desk phones and other communication tools. Together, the two technologies give law enforcement and educators a faster and more coordinated way to respond to potential dangers.",
      "How the system works",
      "Security cameras around each building feed video into the ZeroEyes software. When the AI detects what appears to be a firearm, it highlights the object and immediately shares the footage with human analysts. If those experts confirm that the weapon is real, they send the alert to the district and local authorities. InformaCast then pushes the message to every connected device, allowing staff and students to receive instructions within seconds. The goal is to shorten the time between detection and action so schools can respond before violence has a chance to unfold.",
      "Concerns to consider",
      "As with any new technology, questions remain. Even with human oversight, AI can make mistakes, and false alerts are always a possibility. Privacy also comes into play since the system depends on constant monitoring through security cameras. Cost is another factor because installing, maintaining and training staff for these systems requires significant funding. Finally, schools need to build community trust by explaining how the technology works and preparing students and parents for what to expect during drills or emergencies.",

      "Glassboro district becomes first in U.S. to pair AI gun detection with mass alerts. (Lori Van Buren/Albany Times Union via Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "For parents, teachers and students, this technology represents an important shift in how schools approach safety. AI adds speed to the process by recognizing threats before most people would even notice them. Alerts reach law enforcement and staff almost immediately, creating a critical advantage in a crisis. The system also provides a layered approach to protection by combining cameras, AI and communication tools. Parents may also find reassurance in knowing that human experts verify each threat to help reduce false alarms. While no system is perfect, this integration builds confidence that schools are investing in stronger defenses.",

      "When you search Google for apps, it feels natural to trust the first results you see. They're supposed to be the most reliable, right? Unfortunately, hackers know this too. They're sneaking fake websites into search results that look just like the real thing. If you click and download from one of these sites, you could end up with malware instead of the app you wanted. In other words, the top search results aren't always safe, and that's exactly how scammers trick people.",

      "Researchers at FortiGuard Labs found that attackers are setting up websites that look almost identical to trusted providers. These sites host installers for apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Deepl, Chrome, Telegram, Line, VPN services and WPS Office. The catch is that these downloads include both the real app and hidden malware.",
      "Once you run one, the malware drops files into your system, asks for administrator access and quietly starts spying. It can collect personal information, log everything you type, monitor your screen and even disable your antivirus.",

      "Some versions were designed to snoop on Telegram messages. All of this is possible because hackers use a tactic called SEO poisoning, which manipulates Google's search results so their fake websites appear near the top. Even if you stick to \"safe-looking\" search links, you could still land on a fraudulent page.",
      "How hackers disguise fake apps as real ones",
      "So how do these fake sites end up in your search results in the first place? The attackers use a technique called SEO poisoning. They register lookalike domains, use plugins to game search algorithms and then climb up Google's rankings. That way, when you search for a trusted app, the fake site may appear as one of the first results.",
      "According to FortiGuard Labs, this particular campaign mainly targeted Chinese-speaking users, but the method is being used everywhere. In fact, earlier reports from Cisco Talos showed ransomware groups pushing fake downloads of AI tools like ChatGPT or InVideo. Others used spoofed sites for PayPal, Microsoft, Netflix and Apple. Sometimes, attackers even buy sponsored ads so that their malicious links appear right at the top.",
      "The scary part is that you might not even realize you installed something dangerous. Because the fake installer includes the real app, everything seems to work fine. Meanwhile, the hidden malware is already active on your device. That makes it harder to detect and much easier for attackers to steal your data.",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from malware in Google Searches",
      "I have listed some steps below that you can take to protect yourself from these fake apps and the malware they carry.",
      "The safest way to avoid malware is to get software directly from the official website or verified app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store. Avoid third-party download sites or search results that look suspicious, even if they appear at the top of Google.",
      "Before clicking \"download,\" carefully inspect the domain name. Hackers often create lookalike domains that look nearly identical to real ones, adding small spelling changes or extra words. Even small differences can indicate a fake site designed to deliver malware.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the latest scam takes exploitation of a trusted platform to a new level. Instead of sending generic or suspicious-looking emails, attackers are now abusing Apple's iCloud Calendar invite system to deliver phishing content directly from Apple's own email servers.",
      "This clever tactic allows the fraudulent messages to bypass spam filters and appear more legitimate to unsuspecting users. The goal is to alarm you into calling a scammer's fake support number under the pretense of disputing a fraudulent PayPal transaction. Once contacted, you are manipulated into granting remote access to your devices or sharing sensitive data.",

      "NEW EVITE PHISHING SCAM USES EMOTIONAL EVENT INVITATIONS TO TARGET VICTIMS",
      "Scammers exploit Apple\u2019s iCloud Calendar to deliver phishing invites that bypass spam filters. (Brent Lewin/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How the scam uses iCloud Calendar invites to bypass security",
      "The heart of this scam lies in abusing Apple's official infrastructure to lend credibility to a phishing attempt. Instead of using a suspicious or easily flagged email address, the attackers send calendar invites from Apple's genuine domain, noreply@email.apple.com, as reported by Bleeping Computer.",
      "The attacker embeds the phishing message in the \"Notes\" section of the calendar event, making it appear as a legitimate notification. They send the calendar invite to a Microsoft 365 email address they control, which is part of a mailing list. As a result, the invite is automatically forwarded to multiple real targets, broadening the scam\u2019s reach.",
      "Typically, when emails are forwarded, SPF (Sender Policy Framework) checks fail because the forwarding server isn't listed as an authorized sender. However, Microsoft 365 uses a technique called the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS), which rewrites the return path so that the message still passes SPF checks.",
      "This makes the email appear fully legitimate to both the recipient's inbox and automated spam filters. As a result, the message is far more likely to reach a user's inbox without being flagged, increasing the chance the victim will take the bait.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE USING DOCUSIGN EMAILS TO PUSH APPLE PAY FRAUD",
      "Cybercriminals leverage Microsoft 365 forwarding and Apple\u2019s email domain to outsmart filters. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Why these phishing scams are particularly dangerous",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is the sense of legitimacy it conveys. Because Apple\u2019s official servers send the email directly, users are far less likely to suspect foul play. The message itself aims to panic the recipient by falsely claiming a large PayPal transaction occurred without the recipient's consent. The message includes a phone number to \"contact support\" and dispute the charge, but, in reality, it connects the victim to a scammer.",
      "Once the victim calls the number, the scammer poses as a technical support agent and attempts to convince the caller that the computer has been compromised. The next step is typically to ask the victim to download remote access software under the guise of issuing a refund or securing the account.",
      "In reality, this access is used to steal banking information, install malware or exfiltrate personal data. Because the original message passed security checks and seemed credible, victims often don't think twice before acting.",
      "DON\u2019T FALL FOR THIS BANK PHISHING SCAM TRICK",
      "Fraudsters are hijacking iCloud Calendar invites to trick users into calling fake support lines. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from iCloud Calendar scammers",
      "I have listed some useful steps you can take to protect yourself from falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated phishing scams:",
      "If you receive an unexpected calendar invite, especially one containing a strange message or alarming claims, don't open it or respond. Legitimate companies rarely send payment disputes or security warnings through calendar invites. Always verify suspicious claims by logging into your official account directly.",
      "Phishing scams often include phone numbers that connect you to fraudsters posing as support agents. Instead of calling the number in the message, use official contact details found on the company's official website.",
      "Antivirus programs protect your computer from malware and phishing sites by blocking suspicious downloads and warning you about unsafe websites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Also, keeping your antivirus updated ensures it can defend against the latest threats.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Hackers are able to send you these phishing emails because they have your data. Using a personal data removal service helps scrub your personal information from data broker websites. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to gather details about you and craft convincing, targeted phishing attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "A password manager helps you generate and securely store strong, unique passwords for every account. This reduces the risk of reusing weak passwords that scammers can easily exploit to gain unauthorized access to your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Regularly updating your operating system, browser and applications helps patch security vulnerabilities that attackers often exploit in phishing scams. Staying current with updates minimizes your exposure to known threats.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Scammers are taking phishing attacks in a disturbing new direction by manipulating trusted platforms to deliver malicious content. The safest approach is to treat any unexpected calendar invite, especially those with alarming messages or strange contact numbers, with extreme caution. Never call the number provided in the message or click on any links. Instead, go directly to official websites or your account's official dashboard to verify suspicious activity.",

      "Overpayment scams are on the rise, and they can leave victims thousands of dollars in debt. The setup usually looks harmless: someone sends you a check for more than the agreed amount, asks you to forward the difference and disappears once the check bounces. Below are five of the most common overpayment scams you need to watch for today.",

      "FBI WARNS SENIORS ABOUT BILLION-DOLLAR SCAM DRAINING RETIREMENT FUNDS, EXPERT SAYS AI DRIVING IT",
      "1. The dog walker overpayment scam",
      "Bob from Harrison, Ohio, recently shared how he was nearly tricked by a scammer posing as a pet owner. The con began with a request for dog sitting. Bob was promised $250 for care and food, but then a fake check for $4,358 arrived.",
      "The scammer instructed Bob to send $4,000 of it to an \"appliance retailer.\" Why an appliance retailer when the service was for dog sitting? Scammers often use a third party to make the request sound more believable. If they simply asked for the money back, it would raise red flags. By inventing another company, whether a retailer, shipping service or contractor, they add urgency and legitimacy to the story. In reality, that \"retailer\" is just another front that the scammer controls. Here's the catch: the check appears to be real, but it's actually counterfeit. The bank may release the funds temporarily, but once it bounces, you're on the hook for the entire amount.",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip: If you're asked to forward money to a third party, especially one unrelated to the original deal, treat it as a scam. Keep the check and envelope as evidence, and report it to the FTC and your state attorney general.",
      "2. The online marketplace scam",
      "Selling a couch, bike or electronics online? Some buyers \"accidentally\" send too much. They then ask you to return the difference through Zelle, Venmo or a wire transfer. Once the check or payment reverses, you've lost both the product and the money you returned.",
      "Tip: Always insist on verified payment methods. If a buyer pushes you for a refund quickly, walk away.",
      "FAKE AGENT PHONE SCAMS ARE SPREADING FAST ACROSS THE US",
      "Scammers may try to recruit buyers into buying gift cards before a false check they provided bounces. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. The mystery shopper scam",
      "You might get an email or letter offering a job as a mystery shopper. They send you a large check to \"test\" stores by buying gift cards. You're asked to send the gift card numbers back as proof of purchase. After the bank reverses the fake check, you've lost the money you spent on those gift cards.",
      "Tip: Real companies never pay upfront with extra funds or ask for gift card codes by email.",
      "4. The rental deposit scam",
      "Scammers target renters by mailing a check for more than the deposit or rent. They claim it was a mistake and ask you to refund the difference. The check later bounces, leaving you stuck.",
      "Tip: Only accept payments through secure online portals or in person with verified funds.",
      "5. The work-from-home equipment scam",
      "This one lures jobseekers. The \"employer\" sends a large check to buy office equipment, then directs you to forward the extra funds to a vendor. Of course, the check is fake, and the supposed vendor is also the scammer.",

      "Scammers target remote workers by promising to provide a stipend for work-from-home tech. (iStock)",
      "How to protect yourself from overpayment scams",
      "Now that you've seen how these scams play out, from fake dog sitting gigs to marketplace frauds and bogus job offers, it's clear they all follow the same playbook. Someone sends you too much money and pressures you to forward the extra. That \"extra\" never existed, and once the check bounces, you're left holding the bag. The good news is, there are clear steps you can take to protect yourself and keep your money safe.",
      "Every scam in this article, from the dog walker hoax to rental deposit tricks, begins with an overpayment that looks harmless. If someone pays you more than you're owed, it's not a mistake. It's a scam. Do not respond or send money to any third party. Save the check and envelope as evidence, then report it.",
      "Scammers count on you trusting what you see in your account. In Bob's case, his $4,358 check looked real because the bank showed it as \"available.\" But available isn't the same as cleared. Always ask your bank to confirm when funds are fully verified before you spend a dime.",
      "Urgency is the scammer's strongest weapon. Marketplace fraudsters, renters and fake employers will pressure you to \"fix\" the mistake right away. Slow down, double-check and don't let anyone force you into quick action.",
      "Whether it's for rent, freelance work or selling a used item, scammers prefer paper checks because they're easy to fake. Stick with secure, traceable payment platforms or in-person verified funds. That way, you don't get stuck when a check bounces.",
      "If you receive a suspicious check, save everything: the envelope, emails, texts and any names used. In the dog sitting scam, Bob's saved emails and the scammer's phone number became valuable evidence. This documentation helps law enforcement and protects you if the scammer tries again under another identity.",
      "Scammers often find victims by scraping personal details from online data brokers. That's how they target renters, pet sitters or jobseekers. Using a personal data removal service can limit your exposure and make you harder to target in the first place. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many banks let you set fraud alerts for large deposits or unusual transactions. Turning these on gives you a chance to review suspicious activity before a scammer pressures you into acting on it.",
      "Just like Bob did when he cut contact with the fake pet owner, reporting scams helps protect others. File with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov and your state attorney general. You can also alert your local police and community groups to stop scammers from targeting someone else.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Overpayment scams prey on trust and urgency. They can pop up in online sales, job offers, rental agreements and even friendly community boards. By knowing the warning signs, you can stop scammers before they reach your wallet. Stay cautious whenever you're asked to deposit more than expected and forward the extra. If it sounds strange, it's probably a scam.",

      "But every once in a while, a new model rolls onto the scene that flips that thinking on its head. Meet the Robeta Ananya. This isn't just a van: it's a \"glamper\" on wheels, and it makes other builds look like tin cans.",

      "A true living room, not just a chair",
      "Robeta makes it clear they really mean luxury. Instead of adding the typical swivel seat like most models, they built an actual, fully realized living room. There is a partition between the driving cab and the main cabin. The star of the show is an L-shaped couch that runs over six feet long. And it's not just any couch. It is deep, plush and inviting. It's the kind of seating where you can stretch out on without bumping into a dinette table or a cabinet corner.",

      "Bedtime gets an upgrade",
      "When the sun goes down, that beautiful lounge transforms. A double bed lowers from the ceiling, turning the room into a proper bedroom without having to rearrange cushions or fold anything in a weird way. In the morning, it lifts right back up, making space for coffee and conversation. It is a smooth trick that makes the van feel more like a studio apartment than a rolling compromise. Neither the couch nor the bed needs to sacrifice comfort the way sofa beds typically do.",
      "Laundry on the road",
      "Let's talk about the washer and dryer. Yes, really. A compact Tiny Wash unit is built right into the wardrobe. It handles just enough for a quick refresh, and it actually dries, too. No more hanging socks from cabinet knobs or relying on campground and public laundromats. For extended trips, this little feature is a money saver and an absolute game changer.",

      "Over in the kitchen, things continue to impress. You get a Corian countertop, a proper two-burner gas stove, a grill and oven combo, and a roomy 130-liter fridge and freezer. This setup is ready for real cooking, not just boiling water or reheating prepackaged meals. If you like to eat well on the road, this one is built with you in mind.",
      "A bathroom that feels like a bathroom",
      "At the rear of the van, the bathroom doesn't feel like an afterthought. It has a sink, a full-standing shower and a macerating toilet. Instead of cramming it all into a tiny box, Robeta gave it a soft curtain enclosure that keeps the look minimal and the space functional. It feels clean, intentional and refreshingly roomy.",
      "Power to keep you out there",
      "This luxury van even has the chops for off-roading. The Ananya packs a 10-kilowatt-hour EcoFlow power system with stackable batteries and 450 watts of solar. You can stay off the cord for days without blinking. Add in a 160-liter freshwater tank, diesel heat and hot water via Webasto, and the freedom to wander suddenly looks very comfortable. These amenities are remarkable for a camper van this size.",
      "Robeta Ananya price in the U.S. and how to buy one",
      "The Robeta Ananya is pure luxury on wheels, and its price reflects that. In the United States, the limited Founders' Edition starts at about $295,000. Only five of these exclusive models will be built, with deliveries starting in January 2026. If you want one, you'll need to act quickly. Robeta is taking U.S. orders directly through its website.",

      "Robeta Mobil says that it is only producing five Ananya vans for U.S. customers. (Robeta Mobil)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you've been holding off on van life because you don't want to sacrifice comfort, the Robeta Ananya changes the game. It delivers a real living room, a full kitchen and a bathroom that feels like it belongs in a home. You can wash clothes on the road, sleep in a proper bed and stay powered up for days without plugging in. This means you can explore remote places without giving up the little luxuries that make travel enjoyable. In short, you get the freedom of the open road with the comfort of a high-end apartment.",
      "Stay connected while you roam",
      "When you're traveling in a camper van, nothing kills the vibe faster than losing cell service, especially if you rely on your phone for maps, music, work or keeping in touch. Thankfully, there are two handy solutions to keep you connected: cell phone boosters and mobile hotspots.",
      "Cell phone boosters amplify weak signals from nearby towers, making calls clearer, boosting data speeds and reducing dropped calls. They're ideal for rural drives, national parks or even just passing through patchy areas. Installation typically involves an outside antenna to capture the signal, an amplifier to boost it and an inside antenna to rebroadcast it inside your van.",
      "Mobile hotspots, on the other hand, turn a cellular signal into a private Wi-Fi network for your devices. They're perfect for working remotely from the road, streaming movies or sharing the internet with multiple passengers. Many can run off your phone plan or use a dedicated SIM card for more robust coverage.",
      "Pro tip:\u00a0If your adventures often take you far from towns or highways, a cell phone booster is your best bet for call reliability. If you need strong Wi-Fi for work or entertainment, pair it with a mobile hotspot for the ultimate on-the-road connectivity.",
      "Check out my top 5 best cellphone booster picks at\u00a0CyberGuy.com.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Robeta Ananya proves that camper vans can be more than cramped compromises. With thoughtful design, smart use of space and luxury features, it invites you to travel farther and stay longer in comfort.

I recently received an email from Marie from Boynton Beach, Florida, with a similar concern:",

      "It is a fair concern, Marie. With scams becoming more polished, the line between real and fake accounts is harder to see. Let's break down why fraud is so common on social media, the red flags you should look out for, and the simple habits that can keep you from getting duped.",

      "Why social media is a playground for scammers",
      "Social platforms are built for speed and visibility. Anyone can create an account in minutes, post content instantly and connect with strangers worldwide. This openness is what makes social media engaging, but it is also what makes it ripe for abuse. Fraudsters exploit the fact that posts, comments and messages are consumed quickly and often without much scrutiny.",
      "Verification systems that were once meant to help users identify legitimate accounts have also lost some of their power. On platforms where checkmarks can be purchased, scammers can buy credibility without earning it. Add in the algorithms that reward viral content and sudden spikes in engagement, and you get the perfect environment for fraud to spread unnoticed.",
      "Scammers know people often lower their guard on social media. In these spaces, users share personal details, build emotional ties with influencers and trust posts that look familiar.

      "When people think of scams, they often imagine losing a one-time sum of money. The reality is far more damaging. Clicking a bad link or handing over credentials can snowball into long-term consequences. Once scammers get access to your information, it can be sold on dark web marketplaces, used to open fraudulent accounts or leveraged for identity theft.",

      "Fake accounts often have clear giveaways. Look at how long the account has existed, whether it posts original content and the kind of followers it has. Scammers usually recycle generic profile photos or steal images from real people. Reverse image searches can help you confirm if a photo belongs to someone else.",
      "Even with verification, be skeptical. On platforms where checkmarks can be purchased, anyone can appear \"official\" without being trustworthy. Treat every new interaction with caution until proven otherwise.",

      "This is where having strong antivirus software comes in. Even if you accidentally land on a malicious site, a strong antivirus can block harmful downloads and warn you before malware runs. Think of it as a safety net for moments when curiosity gets the better of you.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Phishing scams frequently mimic login screens for X, Instagram or Facebook. They are designed to trick you into typing your username and password into a fake form. Once you do, the scammer immediately takes over your account.",
      "A password manager can be a lifesaver here. It only fills in your login details on the genuine site you have saved. If it does not recognize the page, that is a red flag that you are looking at a fake. On top of that, a password manager makes it easier to use strong, unique passwords for each account, which limits damage if one gets compromised.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "When money, gift cards or personal details are involved, slow down. Contact the real brand or person through official channels to verify. If you are unsure, simply ignore the request.",
      "One of the strongest defenses you have is your gut feeling. If a verified profile is asking for money, if a giveaway sounds too good to be true or if someone's tone feels off, it probably is. Scammers rely on you ignoring that little voice that says something is not right.",

      "\"There is a substantial amount of discovery in this case, Your Honor. It's voluminous, to say the least. And we're working on a process where we can exchange information as quickly as possible and be efficient in that process,\" Grunander said.",

      "\"\u2026until we can kind of get our heads around exactly what we're dealing with and how much we need to process it, it's going to be difficult for us to give you a reasonable expectation of when we will be ready to do the [preliminary hearing],\" she said.",

      "\"The goal for his new high-profile defense attorneys in the Tyler Robinson case is going to be keep him off of death row,\" said Maryland attorney and legal analyst Randolph Rice, who is following the case. \"And that's probably their goal right now, or at least that's what they're thinking about.\"",
      "One option would be to seek a plea deal that spares Robinson from the potential death penalty, like Bryan Kohberger's defense in the Idaho student murders. That could be months or even years down the line.",
      "If the case does go to trial, prosecutors will have to prove that Kirk's murder included aggravating factors that warrant execution if the suspect is found guilty.",
      "\"What the defense may be able to argue is to say, this was a single sniper bullet that had a single intended target \u2014 and therefore it posed no other danger to anyone else,\" Rice told Fox News Digital. \"And if they can prove that to a jury or they can convince a jury of that, then they won't get the aggravating murder, and therefore they won't have the death penalty on the table.\"",
      "Robinson, like all criminal defendants in the U.S., is considered innocent until proven guilty. But prosecutors are expected to unveil a mountain of evidence in court, and the politically charged case is being closely watched around the country.",
      "Salt Lake City-based criminal defense attorney Skye Lazaro told Fox News Digital it's \"not common\" for state courts to waive a defendant's appearance, but it's something attorneys can request.",

      "The partner, who was identified as trans, is cooperating with investigators.",
      "\"Obviously they've got the concern about defending their client, they've got concerns about the media attention, but I also think that they may have concerns about their personal safety,\" Rice said. \"This certainly is a political assassination. It's something that has been in the headlines. There are a lot of individuals who are emotional about this. And certainly people on the left are certainly emotional about it. People on the right are certainly emotional about it. And so there are concerns from the defense team's perspective.

      "\"One of the things that surprised me out there in Kohberger was they didn\u2019t let him allocute to the crimes,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Usually, when you take a plea, you have to confess to your crimes. I would imagine here, if they do take that off the table and they do get a plea out of him, that he\u2019ll have to allocute and explain his crime in public.\"",
      "He said he expects Robinson's team to explore a potential insanity defense, but his alleged escape from Orem and week spent plotting the crime could complicate that argument.

      "President Donald Trump made the shocking announcement this month that the U.S. is \"trying\" to take back Bagram Airfield from the Taliban in Afghanistan after abandoning it more than four years ago.",
      "There\u2019s just one problem with Trump\u2019s latest ambition \u2014 China will see to it that Washington does not accomplish this goal, warned Bill Roggio, expert analyst and senior editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 \"Long War Journal.\"",
      "\"First of all, the Taliban will never accept the return to the US. I'd sooner\u2026believe the Taliban would give up on its Sharia or Islamic law before I\u2019d believe that it would let the U.S. return,\" Roggio told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"But let's say the Trump administration could convince the Taliban to consider allowing the U.S. to return to Bagram,\" he continued. \"The Chinese would come down hard.\"",

      "Roggio explained that China and Russia have a vested interest in the U.S. staying out of the region.",
      "The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan opened the mineral-rich nation to China and has enabled Beijing to expand its Belt and Road Initiative into a country \u2014 though run by a terrorist organization \u2014 that it was previously unable to tap.",
      "China \u2014 the first country to appoint an ambassador to the Taliban-run nation in 2023 \u2014 sent its foreign minister, Wang Yi, in August to Kabul to hold talks with Afghanistan's acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.",
      "According to the Taliban, China expressed an interest not only in Afghanistan\u2019s mining opportunities, where minerals like lithium, copper, iron, gold and uranium are abundant, but Beijing also said it was open to expand trade with Kabul.",

      "While access to these minerals could greatly benefit China, the impact that trade and mining agreements with Beijing could have on Afghanistan\u2019s dire economy may prove crucial for Kabul.",
      "\"The Chinese just wield significant influence with the Taliban, particularly when it comes to something like the U.S. return,\" Roggio said. \"They would pressure the Taliban by possibly canceling those mining rights, by restricting trade, by ending political and diplomatic recognition. These are all things that are important to the Taliban as they try to develop as a government and try to become legitimately recognized.\"",

      "\"The Taliban don't care if the U.S. recognizes them as much as the Taliban would care if the Chinese would recognize them, if the Russians would recognize them,\" he added.",
      "Trump claimed that the deal he formed with the Taliban in 2020 in Doha, Qatar \u2014 which outlined the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan by May 2021 \u2014 did not include the Bagram Air Base.",
      "\"We were going to keep it,\" Trump told reporters from the U.K. last week.",

      "Trump also said a major reason he wants to get the base back is because it's \"an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.\" But when asked which facility he was referring to, neither the White House nor the Pentagon would confirm, and Fox News Digital could not locate a Chinese nuclear facility through open-source intelligence that close to Afghanistan\u2019s border.",
      "Regardless of whether there is a Chinese nuclear facility near the former American base in Afghanistan, Roggio warned that the economic ties Beijing and Kabul are establishing is \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"The growing Taliban-Chinese relationship is something we should worry about. The Chinese can give the Taliban access to technology \u2014 military technology,\" he said. \"They could give them the resources that they need.\"",
      "Roggio pointed out that a mining deal could put \"billions\" into the Taliban\u2019s pockets.",
      "\"Why is this important? Because al Qaeda and other terrorist groups are using Afghanistan as a base of operations,\" Roggio said, noting that al Qaeda is reported to be running training camps in 13 out of the nation\u2019s 34 provinces.",

      "'The Dave Rubin Show' host Dave Rubin discusses speculation surrounding President Donald Trump and Elon Musk at Charlie Kirk's memorial service on 'America Reports.'",
      "Elon Musk has once again entered the British political fray, this time promoting a new right-wing party, Advance UK, while criticizing the leader of the rapidly growing and influential Reform UK party, Nigel Farage.",
      "Musk recently posted on X: Go with @_AdvanceUK, Ben [Habib] and Tommy [Robinson] for the real change that\u2019s needed to save Britain!\" In another post, he said, \"Advance UK will actually drive change. Farage is weak sauce who will do nothing.\"",
      "Earlier this month, he addressed tens of thousands in London at the \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally organized by the controversial right-winger Tommy Robinson. The billionaire joined the march by video link and condemned the left as \"the party of murder.\"",

      "The billionaire also took aim at the man who could be Britain's next prime minister and claimed Nigel Farage \"doesn\u2019t have what it takes.\" That was before the birth of Advance UK. More recently, he said, \"There needs to be massive government reform in Britain and the people need to be in charge, not some bureaucracy that doesn\u2019t care.\"",
      "The right-leaning party, which is close to officially registering, is led by Ben Habib, a former co-deputy chairman of Reform UK. \"The two-party system is dead,\" Habib said. \"The Conservatives and Labour Party have had their chance, and now the people want something new.\"",
      "\"You clearly don\u2019t have a two-party system,\" said Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society think tank. However, he asked: \"Will this system produce a majority government and whether, for example, at the end of the process it delivers a main opposition party.\"",
      "Part of the fragmentation of British politics is the widespread disgust of political leaders. Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage all received unfavorable views between 52% and 68%, according to data from polling organization YouGov.",

      "Despite the negative view of Farage, Reform UK leads in the polls in the event of a general election, according to the polling company Ipsos. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Reform will win at the next election.",
      "\"If there was an election tomorrow, then it would likely win,\" Mendoza says. However, we don\u2019t know when the next election will be, which makes it near impossible to predict at this stage, he says. \"The golden law of British politics is you can\u2019t predict the vote that far ahead.\"",
      "BRACE FOR A 'POLITICAL REVOLUTION' IN EUROPE, UK'S NIGEL FARAGE SAYS AFTER VANCE'S SPEECH IN MUNICH",
      "When asked why Advance UK is needed when Farage's party is far ahead in the polls, Habib said, \"Reform will not deliver. It stands for nothing. It is a populist party without a political philosophy and without intellectual heft or capability,\" Habib said, claiming \"Farage has a patriotic persona, but he is nothing more than a political expedient. He would be worse than [former Prime Minister] Boris Johnson.\"",
      "Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t look like Advance U.K. will split the vote with Reform. According to Mendoza, bringing Robinson into the party may have been a mistake. During the recent rally, some protestors allegedly attacked police officers. \"Most people will not like violence at a political rally,\" he said. \"And they won\u2019t support the party.\"",
      "One of the leading frustrations voters have at the moment is that neither the current government nor the last one has managed to stop the surge of legal and illegal immigration. In fact, it has worsened. Almost 50,000 undocumented immigrants, many seeking asylum, arrived in Britain in the 12 months through June. That\u2019s up from around 39,000 at the same time the previous year, according to government data.",
      "On Saturday, the Daily Telegraph reported that migrants now account for 98% of the latest rise in population. According to the Office for National Statistics, the Telegraph reported, 69.3 million people were estimated to be living in the country in mid-2024, up 755,254 from the same time in 2023.",

      "\"We need a holistic solution to reduce immigration,\" Habib said. He also said borders must be enforced and illegal migrants deported. Worse still, those asylum-seekers are living in hotels at taxpayers\u2019 expense of \u00a35.8 million a day ($7.4 million).",

      "Earlier this summer, protests over asylum hotels erupted in Epping, southeast England. Separately, Farage suspended one of his local councilors over accusations of racism during the demonstration.",
      "Elon Musk responded to Farage's suspending the council member on X. He wrote: \"Farage is weak, runny sauce. He won\u2019t let Reform even stand up for their own people, e.g. punishing their Epping member, and he will change nothing of significance politically.\"",

Such incidents appear to be fast becoming the norm.",
      "Yet despite Musk's criticism, a new opinion poll released on Friday in the U.K. by YouGov showed Farage's Reform UK on target to deliver a massive defeat of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his ruling Labour Party if an election were to be held.",

      "\u201cI mean, how do you even promote that?\u201d Maron said. \u201cLike, \u2018From the folks that brought you 9/11, two weeks of laughter in the desert.

      "The Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., declined to comment. Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Entertainment Authority, which announced the festival in July, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cThe festival is the largest of its kind globally, bringing together a selection of award-winning comedy stars known for their outstanding performances on international stages and streaming platforms,\u201d the Saudi Press Agency wrote in its announcement for the General Entertainment Authority. \u201cIt reflects the efforts to amplify Riyadh\u2019s status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events.\u201d",
      "Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich home of Islam\u2019s two holiest sites, was for years among the most socially conservative nations on Earth with a morality police enforcing a strict interpretation of Shariah. In recent years under the rule of de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country expanded its cultural and political influence by diversifying its economy and investing in sports, entertainment and tourism to improve its global image. Along with this, the crown prince oversaw a sweeping crackdown on dissent \u2014 imprisoning disgruntled royals, women\u2019s rights advocates, and reforming clerics as well as adherents to previously government-sanctioned proponents of strict Wahhabi Islam.",

      "The nonprofit watchdog organization noted that some of the events land on the seventh anniversary of the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by intelligence operatives with close ties to the crown prince. The festival also takes place just months after Saudi authorities executed Turki al-Jasser, a journalist known for exposing corruption within the Saudi royal family.",
      "\u201cThe seventh anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s brutal murder is no laughing matter,\u201d Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cAnd comedians receiving hefty sums from Saudi authorities shouldn\u2019t be silent on prohibited topics in Saudi like human rights or free speech.\u201d",
      "Other listed performers for the festival include: Sebastian Maniscalco, Maz Jobrani, Tom Segura, Whitney Cummings, Jimeoin, Russell Peters, Andrew Santino, Bobby Lee, Chris Distefano, Mark Normand, Gabriel Iglesias, Hannibal Buress, Sam Morril, Jeff Ross, Omid Djalili, Ali Siddiq, Zarna Garg, Chris Tucker and Ben Hart.",
      "These performers did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Saudi government has been censured by dozens of countries, and in 2024 it was denied a second attempt at scoring a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council. In the U.S., relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 terror attacks have accused the Saudi government of having potential ties to the attack. (A direct link has not been proven.)",
      "But it has also made significant inroads with some powerful figures in the West, most notably the Trump family. President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner worked with the Saudis to secure a $2 billion investment in his firm and recently partnered with the country\u2019s public investment fund to strike a $55 billion deal to take the video game giant Electronic Arts private.

      "At least one comedian, however, appears to have changed his mind despite initially agreeing to perform.

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court justices are scheduled to meet in private on Monday to discuss hundreds of appeals that piled up during their summer recess, including Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s challenge to her criminal convictions for recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The court only takes up a tiny percentage of appeals and will likely announce a list of those it has agreed to hear later in the week. Four of the nine justices have to vote in favor of hearing a case for it to be taken up.",
      "A wide array of other cases are also scheduled to be discussed by the justices at what is known as the \u201clong conference.\u201d They include such issues as gun rights, social media company immunity and Covid-19 era vaccine disputes.",
      "Monday also marks 20 years since John Roberts became Chief Justice. The new nine-month Supreme Court term, when the court will begin hearing cases, officially starts on Oct. 6.",
      "Maxwell\u2019s lawyers say that a deal Epstein made with prosecutors in Florida, in which the then-U.S. attorney agreed not to prosecute potential co-conspirators, should apply to one of the three counts in her case.",
      "The legal question is whether the terms of a so-called nonprosecution agreement apply only in the district where it was negotiated or also bind federal prosecutors nationwide. While the agreement with Epstein was made in Florida, Maxwell was prosecuted in New York.",
      "The Justice Department has urged the Supreme Court not to hear the case, with Solicitor General D. John Sauer noting, among other things, that under internal policies, the U.S. attorney would have needed to obtain permission from superiors if the agreement were to apply outside his district. There is no evidence that occurred, Sauer added.",
      "Epstein\u2019s long history of abuse has surged back into the headlines this year as the Trump administration, in response to pressure from some of President Donald Trump\u2019s own supporters, pledged to release new information about the episode.",
      "But the Justice Department and the FBI then said there was no Epstein \u201cclient list\u201d or evidence he was blackmailing famous men. The government also said it is clear that Epstein killed himself in 2019, pushing back on unfounded conspiracy theories suggesting he was killed.",
      "This prompted a backlash against the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the issue, including from Trump supporters. Trump himself was friendly with Epstein for many years before the two had a falling out. The U.S. attorney who oversaw the nonprosecution agreement with Epstein was Alex Acosta, who served as labor secretary in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who was previously a personal lawyer for Trump, this summer met with Maxwell for hours in an encounter that, at the time, was shrouded in secrecy.",
      "Maxwell was subsequently moved from a low-security prison in Florida to a lower, minimum-security prison camp in Texas. The Bureau of Prisons did not say why she was transferred.",
      "The Justice Department later released a full transcript and audio of Blanche\u2019s interview with Maxwell.",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2022 of three counts relating to her role in assisting Epstein in recruiting and grooming his victims, some of whom were as young as 14 years old. She would befriend the victims and then assist in transporting them to Epstein\u2019s residences. She would also sometimes be present when the abuse took place, prosecutors alleged.",
      "Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison."

A spokesperson for the duchess said the email was sent to counter a threat Epstein had made to sue her and accuse her of defamation.",

      "In an interview with People, Karath, now 67, said, \"It was such a gift to be given six siblings. My sister and brother were 16 and 15 years older than I was, respectively, so I almost grew up as a little bit of an only child. So I suddenly had all of these siblings \u2026 And yeah, they\u2019ve remained in my life forever.\u201d",

      "Only five of the original Von Trapp siblings remain: Charmian Carr (Liesl) and Heather Menzies (Louisa) died almost a decade ago.",
      "\u201cIt was only us seven that knew what that experience was like,\u201d Hammond said in a People interview. \u201cOur own siblings and our parents kind of did, but didn\u2019t really. They didn\u2019t know what it was like to walk into the school cafeteria and suddenly 500 people just stop eating and turn and stare at you.\"",
      "Even now, 60 years after the film premiered, Hammond said that he often hears from some of his castmates on a weekly basis.",
      "\u201cI know there are stories of child actors who have had really unfortunate times, and I feel for that, and I can see how it can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI just feel so blessed that I had a series of good, positive experiences working with people whom I admired and who treated me respectfully. And so to me, it was just the greatest job in the world.\u201d"

      "Robyn Brown definitely didn't see eye-to-eye with her husband on this one and explained why in her confessional.",
      "\"For me, I\u2019m like, OK, well so you have the real relationship with me, but then she\u2019s just, what, a concubine? Because that\u2019s pretty much what that is. It should be more than that, for sure. Most women want commitment. They want love, they want tenderness, they want companionship, they want honesty and depth and and emotional intimacy,\" she said.",

      "\"If I was to ever try this again, (the other woman) would have to be an absolute diamond. And I\u2019m not talking about just looks. ... Just take the sex out completely. She would have to adore Robyn so much that I would never, ever have to worry about whether she was competing with Robyn for my love and affection,\" he said."

      "Jesse Williams may have set his sights on the small screen with his new Prime Video series, \u201cHotel Costiera,\u201d but the Tony-nominated actor isn\u2019t quite ready to exit stage left from the theater world.",
      "Williams made quite the splash during his 2022 Broadway debut in \u201cTake Me Out,\u201d playing Darren Lemming, a mixed-race New York star center fielder who comes out as gay during his career. For his notable contribution on stage, the \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d star received a Tony nomination for best featured actor in a play. That award, however, went to his stage partner, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who won the Tony for his portrayal of Mason Marzac, Lemming\u2019s openly gay accountant that finds interest in the sport after his client comes out.",
      "\"Take Me Out\" won two Tonys, including best revival of a play, and received an extended run, in which Williams and most of the cast reprised their roles. Now, the thespian takes his time to reflect on the life-changing experience and shares why he would never turn his back on the art form.",
      "\u201cI loved my Broadway experience. It was hard as hell, but I loved it,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. \u201cI am so appreciative of the Broadway community. I felt really welcomed. I was excited to join and absorb.\u201d",
      "Though his \u201cTake Me Out\u201d stint may be over, Williams says he still \u201calways sees shows\u201d when he\u2019s in the city, calling it \u201can important part of my life.\"",
      "\"It was a pivotal turning point in my life,\" he explains.",

      "While the actor is focused on \u201cHotel Costiera,\u201d in which he plays a U.S. Marine intelligence officer who now works as a fixer for an Italian hotel owner, Williams is aware fans are eager to see him back on stage, with some holding out hope for him to return as the beguiling Darren.",
      "So what would take for him to return to The Great White Way? Williams says he's looking for \u201csomething new.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we did that for the better part of a year. \u2026 It\u2019s nice to do things where you can hang around for a while, but it\u2019s also nice to finish something and let it breathe on its own,\" he says. \"Let it do what it was supposed to do and move on to a new story. So there\u2019s value in both.\u201d",
      "While Williams\u2019 Darren Lemming may officially be in retirement, the actor finds himself quite busy. Aside from his new series, Williams says he\u2019s working with Harry Belafonte\u2019s family on a forthcoming biopic about the life of the legendary actor and singer who died in 2023. Williams says he plans to take on the role of Belafonte in the film.",

    "story": [
      "The giants of the Amazon are getting even bigger.",
      "A sweeping, new study has found the rainforest\u2019s largest trees are not only holding their ground, but they\u2019re thriving \u2014 growing, multiplying in number and continuing to play a major role in mitigating the impacts of climate change.",
      "There was a 3.3% expansion in big trees per decade, scientists found, after tracking changes in 188 intact forest plots across the Amazon over the past 30 years.",
      "Led by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the U.K. and elsewhere, the findings were published Thursday in the journal Nature Plants.",
      "The authors attributed the growth to the rising amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of gas, oil and coal.",
      "The paper was welcomed as evidence of forest resilience in the face of climate change, but scientists warned these big trees remain vulnerable as droughts, lightning and fires are increasing in frequency, while deforestation continues to pose a serious threat.",
      "There was an understanding that big trees were \u201cexpected to be vulnerable to climate change,\u201d Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert, one of the study\u2019s lead authors, told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday. \u201cWhat we see here is actually they seem to be showing quite a resilience.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing signs of them dying off,\u201d said Esquivel-Muelbert, who co-authored the study while at Britain\u2019s University of Birmingham but has since moved to the nearby University of Cambridge. \u201cThey are increasing in size and number as well.\u201d",
      "Scientists stressed that while protecting intact forest areas was essential to stabilizing the climate, the Amazon cannot on its own offset the vast amount of carbon dioxide produced worldwide by cars, factories and power stations \u2014 and it remains under threat.",
      "The rainforest is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it produces. Pushing the rainforest past its limit could accelerate climate change and have terrible consequences for local communities, including Indigenous groups who depend on it.",
      "Esquivel-Muelbert stressed it was difficult to predict how worsening climate change would have an impact in the future, and hesitated to say that increased CO2 benefited the forest, warning it may cause bigger trees to become more exposed to other factors like drought.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know the consequences in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Other factors, including deforestation, remain a colossal risk to the health of the Amazon.",
      "Fattening trees is, in some ways, a \u201cpositive news story,\u201d said Rebecca Banbury Morgan, a lead author of the study from the University of Bristol. But it also means that the forest is now \u201cmore vulnerable to losing those trees.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough we have shown that trees in intact forest are still increasing in size, any benefits of this in terms of the carbon sink can be quite easily negated by deforestation and logging impacts, so preserving these intact forests is really a priority,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Wildfires, deforestation and global warming could permanently destroy the water cycle that sustains parts of the Amazon rainforest if action is not taken in the coming decades, according to a separate study published last year in Nature.",
      "The study suggested that 10% to 47% of the landscape is at risk of transitioning away from rainforest by 2050 if warming and rates of deforestation aren\u2019t dramatically curbed.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Congress approved a bill in 2023 to relax environmental licensing to pave a highway cutting through the heart of the Amazon, and close to one of the last regions that still has large areas of pristine forest.",
      "Losing a large portion of the Amazon could turn a key carbon sink into a source of emissions, as wildfires burn and plants and animals decompose, no longer able to survive."

    "summary": "America\u2019s newest and largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford is at the center of one of NATO\u2019s largest deployments this week.",
    "story": [
      "ABOARD THE USS GERALD R. FORD, The North Sea \u2014 America\u2019s newest and largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, may be in an undisclosed location in the North Sea off the coast of Norway, but this week it is at the center of one of NATO\u2019s largest deployments.",
      "With a series of unprecedented Russian incursions into NATO countries\u2019 airspace setting off alarm bells throughout Europe, the nuclear-powered carrier has been launching squadron after squadron of fighter jets as part of a multinational operation known as Neptune Strike.",
      "Two NATO officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive operational matters, told NBC News that the jets were taking off for assignments somewhere in Eastern Europe, where tensions have been high after a spate of Russian incursions.",
      "Nerves jangled further on Wednesday when German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told his country\u2019s parliament, the Bundestag, that Russia continued to test the line and overflew a German warship in recent days.",
      "A German military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not allowed to publicly discuss sensitive military matters, confirmed that Russian jets flew close to the frigate called Hamburg. He added that the ship, which is currently operating in the Baltic Sea, was taking part in Neptune Strike, among other things.",
      "The flyby came two days after NATO met to discuss Russia\u2019s recent violation of Estonian airspace with three MiG-31 fighter aircraft. The meeting was convened after Estonia requested consultations under Article 4, a mechanism that prompts urgent talks among allies.",
      "Earlier this month, there was also widespread anger after a number of Russian drones entered Polish airspace during an attack on Ukraine, where President Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces have been at war for more than three and a half  years. A drone also reportedly entered Romanian airspace.",
      "The U.S. and its allies have been weighing a tougher response toward the Kremlin; NATO leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week condemned the Kremlin for a spate of \u201cescalatory\u201d incidents and vowed to defend the alliance.",
      "President Donald Trump also said Tuesday that NATO countries should shoot down Russian military aircraft if they enter their airspace as he met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Pressed on whether the U.S. would back up NATO allies in such a situation, Trump said \u201cit depends on the circumstance.\u201d",
      "Heading to a summit with Putin in Alaska last month, Trump said he wanted a ceasefire. Since then, Moscow has expanded its drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, while seemingly ignoring his overtures for further dialogue to end the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, out at sea, the level of military cooperation seems unimpeded by political currents, as the Ford takes part in Neptune Strike. NATO has said it is not a military exercise, instead calling it an \u201cenhanced vigilance activity.\u201d",
      "On the Ford, it was all-systems-go as squadron after squadron of F-18 fighter jets took off and landed within minutes of each other. The pace on the flight deck was frenetic aboard the nuclear-powered ship, which weighs around 100,000 tons and has a crew of between 4,500 and 4,700.",
      "No ship in the U.S. fleet can launch more jets faster. The dramatic thump of the ship\u2019s four electromagnetic catapults which shoot them into the sky is constant and can be heard throughout the ship.",
      "\u201cSeveral of those aircraft are going a long distance to drop live weapons on a close air support range that is to the northeast of here,\u201d the Ford carrier strike group commander, Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, said after a squadron took off.",
      "The purpose of the \u201cactivity\u201d is to demonstrate large-scale coordination in multiple theaters, NATO says. It has been run several times a year since it started in 2020.",
      "Lanzilotta also stressed that this week\u2019s maneuvers were not a response to recent events in Eastern Europe, but had been planned long in advance. This is part of the core message that NATO intends to send, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not in an action-reaction mode,\u201d he said. \u201cNATO, as you know, is a defensive alliance and that is what we are doing. We\u2019re proving that out and showing it in the way that we planned months ago.\u201d",
      "Protected by Navy F-18 and Dutch air force F-35 fighter jets overhead and French and other Allied ships nearby, as well as launching planes quickly, the Ford can also land them within minutes of clearing the runway.",
      "As they come in to land, the 20-ton jets hook onto a series of wires on the aft end of the deck, before they are quickly moved out of the way by tow trucks and other machinery as another one sets down.",
      "Teams in green, yellow and white vests scurry around orchestrating the operation, which can be extremely dangerous with so much hardware around.",
      "At a briefing, a model of a Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet hung behind Capt. David Dartez, commander of the Ford\u2019s air wing. Asked if that meant Russia was on their minds, he said they trained for any possible adversary.",
      "He also said he had conducted flights as far as Finland, which shares an 800-mile border with Russia.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of fuel-dependent, but we have lots of friendly allies,\u201d he said, adding that he had refueled from a Finnish aircraft while on NATO maneuvers.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t say where I was, but he gave me gas because I was very far away from the aircraft carrier\u2026 at that moment, over 1,000 miles,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Negotiations to end the fighting in Gaza were intense and productive and \u201cwould continue as long as necessary,\u201d Donald Trump said Friday night after meeting with Arab leaders in New York to discuss Israel\u2019s ongoing assault on the famine-stricken enclave.",
      "\u201cIntense negotiations have been going on for four days, and will continue for as long as necessary in order to get a Successfully Completed Agreement,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, calling the discussions \u201cvery inspired and productive.\u201d",
      "Trump did not provide any details about the agreement being discussed, but he has previously insisted that Hamas return all of the remaining Israeli hostages kept in Gaza as part of any deal. In his post, he called for \u201cPERMANENT AND LONGLASTING PEACE!\u201d",
      "Negotiations for either a complete end to the fighting or a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange have previously stalled as both Israel and Hamas have accused the other of reneging on promises, changing details and rejecting deals accepted by the other.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faced a mass walkout as he spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday, has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas has been disarmed, and to maintain lasting security control over Gaza.",
      "After dozens of diplomats left the room, Netanyahu reiterated his intention to \u201cfinish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza, in a combative speech that also saw him attack the recognition of a Palestinian state by multiple Western countries.",
      "Israel and the U.S. have both said that the move risks rewarding  Hamas, which carried out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 hostages were taken into Gaza, according to Israel.",
      "Israel has killed more than 65,000 people in Gaza over the past 23 months, according to health officials in the enclave. It has also destroyed vast areas of the strip, displaced around 90% of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Trump said Friday that the militant group was \u201cvery much aware of these discussions, and Israel has been informed at all levels,\u201d including Netanyahu. \u201cThere is more Goodwill and Enthusiasm for getting a Deal done, after so many decades, than I have ever seen before,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump presented proposals to Arab nations on Monday \u2014 including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt \u2014 during a meeting held on the sidelines of the annual General Assembly, according to his special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Netanyahu, meanwhile, met with the foreign minister for the United Arab Emirates in New York on Friday. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan stressed an urgent need to end the war in Gaza and to reach a permanent and sustainable ceasefire, his office said.",
      "Bin Zayed also reiterated support for efforts to achieve a two-state solution in the region, at the same time as Israel pushes ahead with a widely condemned settlement plan that would effectively split the West Bank in two, further fracturing what Palestinians envision as their future state.",
      "UAE leaders have previously said annexation of the West Bank would be a red line for the influential Gulf state, blocking any future recognition of Israel and preventing the completion of Trump\u2019s landmark Abraham Accords that sought to establish diplomatic normalization between Israel and several Arab states including the UAE.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he would not let Israel annex the occupied West Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "In September, Israel launched a widely condemned ground offensive into Gaza City, the enclave\u2019s most populous area, driving out hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom had previously been displaced on multiple occasions.",
      "Doctors Without Borders said Friday that it had been forced to leave the city in northern Gaza. \u201cWe have been left with no choice but to stop our activities, as our clinics are encircled by Israeli forces,\u201d it said on X.",
      "Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 40 people across Gaza on Saturday, including 23 from Gaza City, Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health, told NBC News.",
      "The spiraling conflict in the Middle East has been a focal point of the General Assembly this week. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas addressed the gathering Thursday, albeit by video after the U.S. last month revoked his visa, along with those of other Palestinian Authority officials.",
      "Palestinians in Gaza \u201chave been facing a war of genocide, destruction, starvation and displacement\u201d by Israel, he said, adding that Palestinians rejected Hamas\u2019 terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and that action did not represent their people."

      "\u201cI took very crystal-clear positions in speeches that I gave in certain places in mosques, I clearly said this should not have occurred,\u201d Pezeshkian said.",
      "While this is not the first time Pezeshkian, who is considered a moderate and has criticized officials and security forces, has spoken out about the implementation of Iran\u2019s hijab laws and subsequent crackdowns, he also said the rest of the world was \u201cblowing things out of proportion.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, each human life is priceless,\u201d he said. But, \u201con a daily basis, hundreds of people are being killed in Lebanon, in Gaza, in all over Palestine, in Yemen and Syria, yet no one bats an eye? Why? These are less human beings?\u201d",
      "Despite Pezeshkian\u2019s moderate position on the issue of hijab, observers say he has little power to stop security forces who have used the war with Israel last June as a pretext to carry out mass arrests of ethnic and religious minorities as well as Afghan migrants, according to human rights groups.",
      "The interview was conducted with a government interpreter present and translating in real time, and NBC News reviewed the translation independently.",
      "Nuclear program",
      "Iran has renewed construction work at an underground site dug into the side of a mountain since the United States and Israel bombed the country\u2019s nuclear facilities, in a sign that Tehran is likely trying to rebuild its heavily damaged nuclear program, according to commercial satellite imagery and experts.",
      "In the three months since U.S. and Israeli warplanes struck three main nuclear facilities in Iran, satellite photos from Maxar indicate significant construction activity at Kuh-e Kolang Gaz La, or Pickaxe Mountain, which was not targeted in the air war. The site is near Natanz, a key nuclear facility that the U.S. military hammered with massive \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs in June.",
      "The images show the construction of an elaborate security fence encircling the mountain, a concrete frame built around a tunnel entrance and a growing pile of excavated soil \u2014 suggesting continued tunneling, analysts said.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the satellite imagery.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Iran is trying to rapidly construct a very deep underground facility just about a mile south of their uranium enrichment facility,\u201d said Joseph Rodgers, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.",
      "\u201cThe construction has really doubled down at Pickaxe Mountain, and they\u2019ve definitely continued to drill,\u201d said Rodgers, who recently produced a report about work at the site.",
      "The White House and CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Llamas asked about the Washington Post report and whether the regime was building another nuclear facility. Pezeshkian said nuclear inspectors were welcome to visit his country.",
      "\u201cIf they are really telling the truth, we have been \u2026 we have come to an agreement, most recently, with the IAEA. They can come and inspect on the ground,\u201d Pezeshkian said, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency, a watchdog body.",
      "\u201cTo put something out based on purported satellite photography, it\u2019s not pertinent in order to create frameworks that are not based in reality. In fact, would it not be easier and much more tangible and verifiable to have inspections in person on the ground?\u201d he added.",
      "The purpose of the site remains unknown. The latest satellite photos suggest Iran may be cautiously developing the location as an option for uranium enrichment or other nuclear work beyond the reach of America\u2019s powerful \u201cbunker-buster\u201d munitions, analysts said.",
      "\u201cIf they were planning on giving up their nuclear program, I don\u2019t think we would see this construction,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. \u201cThey are going underground. Maybe they\u2019re coming to the table, but they are definitely going underground.\u201d",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, limited the scope of what Pezeshkian could accomplish during his time in New York when he said in an address on Tuesday that Iran would not talk directly to the U.S. about its nuclear program and would not negotiate on the issue of ballistic missiles or uranium enrichment.",
      "While Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, hard-line parliamentarians have called for the building of a nuclear weapon. The country now enriches uranium to near-weapons-grade levels \u2014 the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program known to do so.",
      "Asked about the high level of enrichment, Pezeshkian said, \u201cThe religious leader of the country issued fatwa and repeated ... multiple times that it is unholy, or haram, to seek weaponization, to seek nuclear weapons, to seek any type of weapons of mass destruction. This is rooted in our ideology. It is unambiguous. And it is not changeable. So nothing has prevented us from having ... the fullest cooperation with the IAEA.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the United Nations Security Council voted against a Russian and Chinese resolution to delay reimposing sanctions, which, despite the diplomatic push from Pezeshkian and his foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, will very likely lead to penalties being reimposed after the Saturday deadline.",
      "Without a diplomatic breakthrough on the sanctions, critics will likely blast Pezeshkian for coming home empty-handed.",
      "\u201cPezeshkian\u2019s presidential campaign was premised on diplomatic engagement abroad and attempts to moderate the regime\u2019s heavy hand at home,\u201d said Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cMore than a year into office, the limits of significant shifts within a system trapped in half-measures are clear.\u201d",
      "\u2018Set fire\u2019 to the region",
      "Before traveling to the U.S., Pezeshkian was urged by prominent intellectuals and former officials to meet with Trump directly to reduce tension and prevent another attack from the U.S. or Israel. Asked if he was concerned about more war coming to Iran and an expected meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pezeshkian struck a defiant tone.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of war. We do not seek war,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump has said that his administration has come to create peace, but the path that they have embarked upon will set fire to the entire region.\u201d",

Along with this, the crown prince oversaw a sweeping crackdown on dissent \u2014 imprisoning disgruntled royals, women\u2019s rights advocates, and reforming clerics as well as adherents to previously government-sanctioned proponents of strict Wahhabi Islam.",
      "Celebrities and influencers have often been criticized for performing in the country or participating in tourism campaigns, and FIFA drew condemnation last year for selecting Saudi Arabia to host the 2034 World Cup.",
      "Shane Gillis, who said he was offered an invite, claimed that the organizers \u201cdoubled the bag,\u201d or the amount of money offered, after he declined to participate.",
      "\u201cIt was a significant bag, but I\u2019d already said no,\u201d Gillis said on his podcast. \u201cI took a principled stand.\u201d",
      "On TikTok and Instagram, verified accounts that appeared to belong to Turki Al-Sheikh, a royal court adviser who has emerged as a powerful figure in sports and entertainment as part of Saudi Arabia\u2019s push into the global culture industry, posted videos of Chappelle and Hart.",
      "In a news release last week, Human Rights Watch wrote that the Saudi government is using the festival \u201cto deflect attention from its brutal repression of free speech and other pervasive human rights violations\u201d and called on the performers \u201cto publicly urge Saudi authorities to free unjustly detained Saudi dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit watchdog organization noted that some of the events land on the seventh anniversary of the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by intelligence operatives with close ties to the crown prince. The festival also takes place just months after Saudi authorities executed Turki al-Jasser, a journalist known for exposing corruption within the Saudi royal family.",
      "\u201cThe seventh anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s brutal murder is no laughing matter,\u201d Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cAnd comedians receiving hefty sums from Saudi authorities shouldn\u2019t be silent on prohibited topics in Saudi like human rights or free speech.\u201d",
      "Other listed performers for the festival include: Sebastian Maniscalco, Maz Jobrani, Tom Segura, Whitney Cummings, Jimeoin, Russell Peters, Andrew Santino, Bobby Lee, Chris Distefano, Mark Normand, Gabriel Iglesias, Hannibal Buress, Sam Morril, Jeff Ross, Omid Djalili, Ali Siddiq, Zarna Garg, Chris Tucker and Ben Hart.",
      "These performers did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Saudi government has been censured by dozens of countries, and in 2024 it was denied a second attempt at scoring a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council. In the U.S., relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 terror attacks have accused the Saudi government of having potential ties to the attack. (A direct link has not been proven.)",
      "But it has also made significant inroads with some powerful figures in the West, most notably the Trump family. President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner worked with the Saudis to secure a $2 billion investment in his firm and recently partnered with the country\u2019s public investment fund to strike a $55 billion deal to take the video game giant Electronic Arts private.

      "NEW YORK \u2014 The United States clashed with world leaders over artificial intelligence at the United Nations General Assembly this week, rejecting calls for global oversight as many pushed for new collaborative frameworks.",
      "While many heads of state, corporate leaders and prominent figures endorsed a need for urgent international collaboration on AI, the U.S. delegation criticized the role of the U.N. and pushed back on the idea of centralized governance of AI.",
      "Representing the U.S. in Wednesday\u2019s Security Council meeting on AI, Michael Kratsios, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said, \u201cWe totally reject all efforts by international bodies to assert centralized control and global governance of AI.\u201d",
      "The path to a flourishing future powered by AI does not lie in \u201cbureaucratic management,\u201d Kratsios said, but instead in \u201cthe independence and sovereignty of nations.\u201d",
      "While Kratsios shot down the idea of combined AI governance, President Donald Trump said in his speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday that the White House will be \u201cpioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust\u201d to enforce the Biological Weapons Convention.",
      "\u201cHopefully, the U.N. can play a constructive role, and it will also be one of the early projects under AI,\u201d Trump said. AI \u201ccould be one of the great things ever, but it also can be dangerous, but it can be put to tremendous use and tremendous good.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, a State Department spokesperson said, \u201cThe United States supports like-minded nations working together to encourage the development of AI in line with our shared values. The US position in international bodies is to vigorously advocate for international AI governance approaches that promote innovation, reflect American values, and counter authoritarian influence.\u201d",
      "The comments rejecting collaborative efforts around AI governance stood in stark contrast to many of the initiatives being launched at the General Assembly.",
      "On Thursday, the U.N. introduced the Global Dialogue on AI Governance, the U.N.\u2019s first body dedicated to AI governance involving all member states. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the body would \u201clay the cornerstones of a global AI ecosystem that can keep pace with the fastest-moving technology in human history.\u201d Speaking after Guterres, Nobel Prize recipient Daron Acemoglu outlined the growing stakes of AI\u2019s rapid development, arguing that \u201cAI is the biggest threat that humanity has faced.\u201d",
      "But in an interview with NBC News, Amandeep Singh Gill, the U.N.\u2019s special envoy for digital and emerging technologies, said that the United States\u2019 critical perception of the U.N.\u2019s role in international AI governance was misconstrued.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation to say that the U.N. is somehow getting into the regulation of AI,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThese are not top-down power grabs in terms of regulation. The regulation stays where regulation can be done in sovereign jurisdictions.\u201d",
      "Instead, the U.N.\u2019s mechanisms \u201cwill provide platforms for international cooperation on AI governance,\u201d Gill said.",
      "In remarks immediately following Kratsios\u2019 comments, China\u2019s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ma Zhaoxu said, \u201cIt is vital to jointly foster an open, inclusive, fair and nondiscriminatory environment for technological development and firmly oppose unilateralism and protectionism.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe support the U.N. playing a central role in AI governance,\u201d Ma said.",
      "One day after Kratsios\u2019 remarks at the Security Council, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez seemed to push back on Kratsios and gave full-throated support for international cooperation on AI and the U.N.\u2019s role in AI governance.",
      "\u201cWe need to coordinate a shared vision of AI at a global level, with the U.N. as the legitimate and inclusive forum to forge consensus around common interests,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cThe time is now, when multilateralism is being most questioned and attacked, that we need to reaffirm how suitable it is in addressing challenges such as those represented by AI.\u201d",
      "Reacting to the week\u2019s developments, Renan Araujo, director of programs for the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for AI Policy and Strategy, told NBC News that \u201cno one wants to see a burdensome, bureaucratic governance structure, and the U.S. has succeeded in starting bilateral and minilateral coalitions. At the same time, we should expect AI-related challenges to become more transnational in nature as AI capabilities become more advanced.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time the U.N. has addressed AI, having passed the Global Digital Compact last year. The compact laid the foundation for the AI dialogue and for an independent international scientific panel to evaluate AI\u2019s abilities, risks and pathways forward. Guterres announced that nominations to this panel are now open.",
      "While Thursday\u2019s event marked the launch of the global dialogue and panel, the dialogue will have its first full meeting in Geneva in summer 2026, in tandem with the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s annual AI for Good summit. The dialogue\u2019s exact functions and first actions will be charted out over the coming months."

    "summary": "The Supreme Court handed another win to the Trump administration by allowing it to withhold $4 billion in spending on foreign aid that was approved by Congress.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday handed another win to the Trump administration by allowing it to withhold $4 billion in spending on foreign aid that was appropriated by Congress.",
      "A federal judge had ruled that the administration would have to spend the funds by the end of the month, but the Supreme Court's decision puts that on hold.",
      "\u201cThis result further erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order. It will also have a grave humanitarian impact,\" said Nicolas Sansome, a lawyer with Public Citizen Litigation Group, which represents nonprofit groups that sued.",
      "The brief order noted that the government has made a \"sufficient showing\" that the groups that sued were barred from bringing the lawsuit in question under a law called the Impoundment Control Act.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, also noted that \"the asserted harms to the Executive\u2019s conduct of foreign affairs appear to outweigh the potential harm\" to the plaintiffs, which are various groups that receive foreign aid funds.",
      "The court has now granted 20 emergency applications filed by the administration since President Donald Trump\u2019s second term began in January. The volume of emergency filings and the rate at which the court has ruled in the administration's favor are both unprecedented. The latter has sparked criticism from within the legal community, including lower court judges.",
      "A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.",
      "The three liberals on the court dissented, with Justice Elena Kagan writing that the legal issue in the case has not been presented before, meaning the court was working in \"uncharted territory.\"",
      "Yet again, the majority nevertheless granted the emergency request made by the government without hearing oral arguments or issuing a fully reasoned decision, she added.",
      "\"We therefore should have denied this application, allowed the lower courts to go forward, and ensured that the weighty question presented here receives the consideration it deserves,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts had on Sept. 9 issued a temporary stay that put the lower court ruling on hold while the Supreme Court decided what next steps to take.",
      "The Trump administration, which has aggressively sought to exert its power over Congress in recent months, has notified lawmakers of its intention not to spend the funds.",
      "This action has sparked a debate over whether the president has such authority, as under the Constitution, it is the role of Congress to allocate money for the president to spend.",
      "After the Supreme Court decision, Democrats quickly urged Congress to reassert its authority to control spending even as lawmakers are engaged in a budget fight that could lead to a government shutdown.",
      "\"Republicans should join Democrats to stand up for our power of the purse,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa. and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. said in a joint statement.",
      "The Trump administration has already taken swift action to unravel the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government department that traditionally handed out billions of dollars a year in foreign aid to tackle such issues as access to water and disease prevention.",
      "The money at issue was appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it wants to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, but will spend another $6.5 billion that Congress appropriated.",
      "The Impoundment Control Act was passed in 1974 to regulate the president\u2019s control over the budget. That followed efforts by then-President Richard Nixon to withhold spending on programs he did not support.",
      "The Trump administration says it can withhold the money via a process known as \"rescission,\" in which the president informs Congress of his intention not to spend certain funds.",
      "But with little time left before the funds expire, Congress is unlikely to respond, even if it wanted to. Republicans who broadly support Trump's policies control both chambers and are in the process of trying to fund the government for the next fiscal year before Oct. 1; otherwise, the government will shut down.",
      "The administration's decision to wait until the end of the fiscal year to notify Congress is a legally questionable tactic that has been called a \"pocket rescission\" and has not been used in nearly 50 years.",
      "Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali had ruled on Sept. 3 that the administration must spend the money unless Congress acts to withdraw it.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in a court filing that Ali's ruling imposed unacceptable restrictions on the president by, among other things, forcing the administration to engage in diplomatic discussions with other countries over how to spend the money",
      "The underlying lawsuit challenging Trump's rescission was brought by various groups led by the Global Health Council.",
      "Their lawyers said in court papers that the administration's legal arguments would turn the Impoundment Control Act on its head by reaching the conclusion that \"Congress\u2019s signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court.\""

    "story": [
      "Black liberation activist and American fugitive Assata Shakur, who escaped to Cuba more than 45 years ago after she was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper, died in Havana, the government announced Friday.",
      "She was 78.",
      "Shakur, who changed her name from Joanne Chesimard, died Thursday from health ailments and advanced age, according to a short statement released by the Cuban Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cWords cannot describe the depth of loss that I am feeling at this time. I want to thank you for your loving prayers,\u201d her daughter Kakuya Shakur wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "Shakur was involved in a shootout during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973. State Trooper Werner Foerster, the second officer responding to the scene, found a loaded gun on the driver of the car, according to previous NBC News reporting. Shakur was in the front passenger seat and another man was seated behind her.",
      "There was an exchange of gunfire. James Harper, the state trooper who initially pulled the group over, said he saw Shakur shoot Foerster in the stomach with the officer's gun after he tussled with the driver, who also shot Foerster in the arm.",
      "Shakur and two men she was with returned to the car and drove five miles down the New Jersey Turnpike. One of the men with them, James Coston, died in the car. As they dumped Coston's body on the side of the road, police caught up to the group. Shakur was arrested while the driver fled and was found nearly two days later.",
      "Shakur, who was sentenced to life in prison, denied shooting Foerster. To supporters, she was an activist jailed for crimes she did not commit.",
      "In a statement, Foerster's family said her death did not bring any joy to them, but did bring \"a measure of closure to a tragedy that has deeply affected our family and community.\"",
      "\"While this development marks the end of a long and painful chapter, it does not erase the profound loss we continue to feel each day,\" the family said. \"The pain of losing Werner is something we carry every single day. His absence is felt in every quiet moment, every family gathering, and every milestone he should have been here to witness.\"",
      "Shakur was born Joanne Deborah Byron in Queens, New York, on July 16, 1947. After what she described in her autobiography as a troubled childhood, she became involved in political activism at the Borough of Manhattan Community College and City College of New York. She was a member of the revolutionary Black Liberation Army, as well as the Black Panther Party. At 21, she married Louis Chesimard, though their marriage lasted only a year.",
      "Shakur was serving a life sentence at the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey after being convicted in 1977 of murder in Foerster's death. She had also been implicated in armed robbery and other crimes. She escaped from prison on Nov. 2, 1979, with the help of members of the Black Liberation Army who posed as visitors. She turned up a few years later in Cuba, where the island\u2019s leader at the time, Fidel Castro, granted her political asylum. She published an autobiography in 1987.",
      "Because Cuba repeatedly refused to extradite her to the U.S., Shakur and other fugitives living in Cuba became a major sticking point in negotiations between the U.S. and the communist-run island after President Barack Obama re-established diplomatic relations between the two countries.",
      "Then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Shakur should be returned to New Jersey after the ceremonial reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba in 2015.",
      "Gov. Phil Murphy and state Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan said in a statement Friday that their offices have worked with the State Department in previous attempts to bring Shakur back to New Jersey to face accountability for Foerster's killing and for fleeing the country.",
      "\"We will vigorously oppose any attempt to repatriate Chesimard's remains to the United States,\" they wrote.",
      "Shakur became the first woman on the FBI\u2019s list of most wanted terrorists in 2013. She was added to the list on the anniversary of Foerster\u2019s death. There was a $2 million reward for information leading to her arrest.",
      "Supporters of Shakur, who was rapper Tupac Shakur's godmother through her brother Mutulu Shakur, believed she was a target of law enforcement for her involvement with the Black Liberation Army.",
      "In a 1998 interview with NBC New York in Havana, Shakur said she had never killed anyone and was found guilty in an \u201cunfair trial\u201d by an all-white jury.",
      "\u201cI was shot with my arms in the air, then shot again in the back and left on the ground to die,\u201d she said. \u201cNext thing I knew, they were coming by me and saying, \u2018Is she dead yet, is she dead yet?\u2019\u201d",
      "She said she was later taken to a hospital, where she was beaten and tortured by state troopers who she said would stick their hands in her wounds and ask if it hurt.",
      "\u201cAmerican racism has done to another Black person what it has done to Black people down through the years,\u201d Shakur\u2019s defense attorney William Kunstler said in 1977. \u201cThe reality is, this beautiful young Black woman never had a chance, but we, like liberal fools, still had hopes.\u201d"

      "Facing down a mass walkout and mounting diplomatic pressure, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Friday to \u201cfinish the job\u201d as he defied growing isolation over his military\u2019s  devastating assault on the Gaza Strip.",
      "Netanyahu was met by a mix of jeers and applause as he spoke to a half-empty room at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. He instead directed his address to Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, Hamas fighters battling his troops and the host of world leaders who have moved to recognize Palestine as a state.",
      "He reserved praise for President Donald Trump, who told reporters moments after Netanyahu finished his speech: \u201cI think we have maybe a deal on Gaza.\u201d The president, who will meet with his close ally next week, offered little further detail on talks, which have frequently broken down in the past.",
      "The United States has stood by Israel while a growing list of countries have condemned its offensive in the besieged Palestinian territory. Netanyahu also branded as \u201cshameful\u201d the decision by a wave of countries to formally recognize a Palestinian state.",
      "He touted Israel\u2019s military operations across the Middle East and vowed to press ahead with the assault on Gaza.",
      "\u201cThe final remnants of Hamas are holed up in Gaza City,\u201d the Israeli leader said of his military\u2019s ground offensive in the famine-stricken area. \u201cThey vow to repeat the atrocities of Oct. 7 again and again and again. This is why Israel must finish the job.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu added that while \u201cWestern leaders may have buckled under the pressure,\u201d he guaranteed that \u201cIsrael won\u2019t.\u201d",
      "He spoke after scores of delegates walked out of the room as he approached the podium.",
      "Netanyahu said his speech was being broadcast through loudspeakers across Israel\u2019s border with Gaza, in hopes of reaching hostages who remain held in the enclave \u2014 and claimed it was being carried on cellphones of Palestinians across the territory after they were taken over by Israel\u2019s intelligence services.",
      "\u201cWe have not forgotten you, not even for a second. The people of Israel are with you,\u201d Netanyahu said to the hostages, whose families have staged angry protests accusing him of endangering their loved ones by refusing to agree to a peace deal.",
      "In a message to any Hamas members who might see the broadcast, he said, \u201cLay down your arms. Let my people go.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you do, you will live. If you don\u2019t, Israel will hunt you down,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIt will be a mark of shame on all of you,\u201d he said.",

      "In a sign of that isolation the Israeli leader took an unusual route to New York, with his flight path appearing to avoid countries that could enforce an international arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes in Gaza.",
      "Israeli forces have ramped up their assault on Gaza City, forcing the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people while others stay put under near-daily deadly strikes.",
      "In response countries including France and the United Kingdom have formally recognized Palestine as a state, leading Trump to issue a firm warning.",
      "\u201cI will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. No, I will not allow it. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Trump told reporters Thursday, having earlier privately assured Arab leaders on the subject.",
      "Asked whether he had discussed the issue with Netanyahu, Trump said, \u201cWhether I spoke to him or not, I did, but I\u2019m not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s been enough. It\u2019s time to stop now,\" he said.",
      "Trump issued the rare admonishment after far-right members of Netanyahu's fragile government coalition called for the move.",
      "Palestinians envision the West Bank as a key territory for an internationally recognized state, alongside Gaza and east Jerusalem. Annexation of the territory, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, would further imperil that cause.",
      "Trump also presented his 21-point plan for peace to Arab leaders, with his special envoy Steve Witkoff saying the meeting was \u201cproductive\" and that a breakthrough could be imminent.",
      "Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, is looking to play a senior role in running postwar Gaza under a peace plan, the Financial Times newspaper reported.",
      "Blair's office declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was among the leaders to address the U.N. General Assembly, though he was forced to deliver his address by video after the U.S. last month revoked his visa, along with those of other Palestinian Authority officials.",
      "In his video address on Wednesday, Abbas said Palestinians in Gaza \u201chave been facing a war of genocide, destruction, starvation and displacement\u201d by Israel, adding that \u201cdespite all what our people have suffered, we reject what Hamas carried out on the 7th of October.\u201d",
      "Abbas said Hamas would have \u201cno role to play in governance\u201d in the future he envisioned for Gaza.",
      "That future is at stake in peace talks, and Netanyahu's address to world leaders comes as he continues to defy the mounting pressure from his closest ally and the families of hostages still held in Gaza to end the war."
