      "Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece.",
      "Bowers\u2019 work on \u201c The Wild Robot \u201d continues to solidify his place as one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after composers, earning him a nomination for best original score. His score complements the film\u2019s stunning visuals and emotional depth, capturing the journey of Roz, an out-of-place robot striving to connect with animals who struggle to understand it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being really clear with each story, understanding what the emotions is and what\u2019s stirring inside of me,\u201d said Bowers, 35, a Grammy and Emmy-nominated composer who won an Academy Award for the short documentary \u201cThe Last Repair Shop.\u201d He\u2019s also worked on Oscar-winning films such as \u201cKing Richard\u201d and \u201c Green Book.\u201d",
      "For \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bowers first studied the early black-and-white sketches, where he uncovered his emotions toward the characters, before capturing those feelings at his piano, crafting a musical narrative filled with heart. Bowers said tapping into his emotions has never come easily, but he found inspiration in his journey as a father, watching his wife sacrifice her body during pregnancy, to help craft sounds that capture the essence of parenthood.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Bowers reflects on what the Oscar nomination means to him, the challenges of composing for animated films, the lasting influence of five-time Oscar winner John Williams and why Kobe Bryant \u2019s advice continues to resonate with him.",
      "The Oscars will air March 2.",
      "____",
      "BOWERS: It means a lot. As a kid, that's how I found a lot of composers. I was looking at that (Oscar noms) list. I would look at who's nominated then go listen to those scores, so it became a way to expand my collection of CDs. It means something to be a part of this history. No matter what happens in my career from here on out, somebody's going to look at this year's list and see my name. To be nominated, you are chosen by the music branch of the academy ... filled with composers who I've been a fan of since I was a kid. ... It makes me feel like I've done something meaningful.",
      "BOWERS: Yeah, he was the master of memorable melody. If there's a piece of score in a move that you can sing, it's probably John Williams. One thing I took from him is that he came up in a time of composers who were storytellers and made sure the music was also developing the story. When those themes come back at the most pivotal point in the movie, we feel something emotional. I remember for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I studied the last 30 minutes of \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\u201d primarily because the last 20-30 minutes of \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d is all action. I thought, \u201cHow did John Williams approach this?\" Because \u201cStar Wars\u201d was so iconic with its themes.",
      "BOWERS: The only moment was when I played the main theme. I was kind of just wanting to see if it triggered that complexity. I do this often with my wife where I\u2019ll have a theme that I\u2019m playing it and ask her \u201cWhat does this remind of, or what does this make you feel? I remember when I played her that sequence, which was a work in progress, and she got emotional. She cried watching just that three-minute sequence, having no idea of what the movie was about. I felt like I was on the right track. ... It\u2019s reminding her of all the complex emotions she feels as a mom. I struck a nerve in a way that could be valuable.",
      "BOWERS: It\u2019s definitely more challenging. If you talk to any composer, they\u2019ll talk about the fact that animation is its own challenge. Most animated films have almost wall-to-wall music where music kind of doesn\u2019t ever stop. Whereas, a lot of live action, you can sit for five minutes and not have any music and be OK.",
      "BOWERS: I did a lot of work for Kobe. He talked about John Williams being my Michael Jordan. He was all about obsessing enough about your craft, so that you are ready for anything. The stuff I wrote for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I learned from when he would challenge me to write. I wrote this audiobook for him, and he was like \u201cYou know this has to be better than the music for \u2018E.T.\u2019?",
      "I laughed. And he was like \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not (expletive) kidding with you, right?\u201d",
      "He was always telling me, \u201cIf you\u2019re not taking on something that\u2019s going to make you a better artist by the time you finish it, then you are wasting your time.\u201d",
      "That kind of mentality is the way I approach everything. I want to take on as many things as possible. If that opportunity came, I\u2019d be prepared for it.",
      "BOWERS: I feel like my parents put me on this track from the very beginning. They wanted me to play piano before I was born. They gave me lessons and like found teachers for me. There\u2019s kind of like this debt I owe to them. I have to be as great as I possibly can. But it\u2019s also just me trying to live up to the steps my parents already got started for me.",

      "For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday",
      "NEW YORK -- For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday.",
      "Movies like \u201cWicked,\"\u201cInside Out 2\" and \u201cThe Substance\u201d lifted Hollywood's theatrical releases to gender parity in leading roles in 2024. Of the 100 top domestic grossing films in 2024, 42% had female protagonists, and 42% had male protagonists, according to a report issued by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University.",
      "The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which also released its annual study Tuesday, found that 54% of the top 100 films at the box office in 2024 featured girls and women as protagonists. That's a massive jump from just the year prior, when 30% of films featured women in lead roles. In 2007, when the USC annual study began, that figure was just 20%.",
      "\"This is the first time we can say that gender equality has been reached in top-grossing films,\u201d Stacy L. Smith, founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn 2024, three of the top five films had a girl or woman in a leading role, as did five of the top 10 films \u2014 including the number one film of the year, Disney\u2019s \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019\" added Smith. \"We have always known that female-identified leads would make money. This is not the result of an economic awakening but is due to a number of different constituencies and efforts \u2014 at advocacy groups, at studios, through DEI initiatives \u2014 to assert the need for equality on screen.\u201d",
      "Other metrics suggested the gains in leading roles masked still-endemic disparity throughout Hollywood. The percentage of female characters in speaking roles increased from 35% to 37% in 2024, according to the San Diego State study. Major female characters rose from 38% in 2023 to 39% in 2024.",
      "\u201cFilms such as \u2018The Substance\u2019 pushed back hard against a culture that considers women disposable,\u201d Lauzen stated. \u201cWhile the number of films with female protagonists rose to a historic high in 2024 after a dismally lean 2023, the percentages of women in the more stable categories of major and speaking roles reflected only minor gains.\u201d",
      "Universal Studios, which is led by Donna Langley, was the studio with the best record for female representation. In 2024, 66.7% of Universal releases centered on girls and women, according to the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.",
      "Neither study captures the large number of films released directly on streaming platforms or films that fall outside the top 100 movies in theaters. But for decades, those top box-office films have offered a snapshot of a film industry that has long failed to come close to reflecting the demographics of American society.",
      "That remains the case for underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, who account for roughly 42% of the U.S. population.",
      "In the top 2024 films in 2024, 25% included an underrepresented lead or co-lead, according to Annenberg. In those 25 movies, the lead or co-leads were 38.% Black, 15.4% Asian or Asian American and 3.9% Hispanic.",
      "That was a substantial decrease from 2023, when 37 leads or co-leads were people of color.",
      "\u201cThe progress we saw for female-identified leads was not matched by the findings for underrepresented leads,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis downturn signifies a lack of investment in storytelling that reflects the audience as a whole. The reality is that audiences want to see stories about women and people of color \u2014 studios and filmmakers do not have to choose between the two.\u201d"

      "A man suspected of killing rap icon Tupac Shakur has failed to appear in court for a hearing on whether his defense team is ready to go trial",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The only suspect ever charged in the killing of Tupac Shakur did not appear in court Tuesday for a hearing on whether his defense team is prepared to go to trial.",
      "Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis also did not attend a scheduled hearing in another case, in which he is accused of fighting with another man at the Clark County Detention Center in late December.",
      "A spokesperson for Davis' attorney declined to say why he did not attend either hearing. The Associated Press left messages with the detention center seeking more information.",
      "Davis, who pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the 1996 death of the rap icon in Las Vegas, has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest.",
      "Lawyer Carl Arnold told Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny that Davis would \u201cprobably want to be here\u201d for the trial readiness hearing and requested that it be pushed to next week. Kierny agreed and set a Feb. 18 date for it. Kierny said she thought Davis was absent because he was in the other hearing.",
      "The trial is scheduled to begin in March.",
      "A grand jury indicted Davis separately last week on charges of battery and challenging someone to a fight, moving that case from Justice Court to state District Court. He is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.",
      "A correctional officer told grand jurors that he was escorting Davis back to his unit when he and the other man exchanged words and then started fighting in a common room, according to the Review-Journal. Davis\u2019 legal team said he was ambushed and acted in self-defense.",
      "In the Shakur case, Arnold argues that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.",
      "Kierny has said Davis is not protected from prosecution because he lacks proof of any such agreements.",
      "Prosecutors say they have strong evidence against him, including his own accounts of the shooting in a tell-all memoir. Davis, an ex-gang leader, is accused of orchestrating the killing near the Las Vegas Strip."

      "In discussion with a Los Angeles judge on the last phases of Rocky's trial, his lawyer Joe Tacopina said that either his client would testify early Tuesday or the defense would rest its case. An attorney for the prosecution said his team was going to spend the night preparing for Rocky's testimony.",
      "He is not legally required to testify, and subjecting a defendant to a difficult cross-examination is often a major gamble in criminal cases.",
      "Tacopina said before the trial that Rocky was \u201ceager to tell his story. He would love the opportunity to do so.\u201d",
      "The attorneys could not give comment outside court Monday because a judge has forbidden them from speaking to the media. Rocky faces up to 24 years in prison if convicted, after turning down a pre-trial plea deal that could have led to just 180 days in jail.",
      "If Rocky testifies, he\u2019ll probably have to face a long and combative cross-examination from Deputy District Attorney John Lewin. In his most famous case, Lewin kept real estate heir Robert Durst on the stand for nine days of relentless questioning before he was convicted of murder.",
      "Rocky is a Grammy-nominated hip-hop star, fashion mogul and the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear Tuesday to watch his testimony.",
      "She has shown up sporadically \u2014 most recently on Friday, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, would likely testify that a gun he fired twice \u2014 in a scuffle with a former friend on a Hollywood street corner in 2021 \u2014 was a starter pistol that only fired blanks, and that he carried it for security.",
      "On Monday, his tour manager became the second witness from Rocky's inner circle to testify that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Lou Levin said he told the rapper it made sense to carry it after Rocky's house had been broken into by a stalker and others.",
      "\u201cSecurity and I thought it would be a good idea, because of the prior violence,\" Levin said. \"It\u2019s just a nonlethal form of self-defense.\u201d",
      "Levin said he got the gun from a video shoot in the summer of 2021, about three months before the incident that led to the charges, and on the day itself.",
      "He told the jury that he returned the phony gun to the music video's co-director, who no longer had it when Levin asked about it after Rocky's arrest. The defense said it does not have the starter pistol now.",
      "Authorities also did not recover the pistol they allege Rocky used.",
      "Levin testified that an ammunition magazine found in Rocky's house by officers serving a search warrant actually belonged to him.",
      "Lewin, the prosecutor, said \u201cyou had to come up with a story\u201d to explain the magazine. He later called every aspect of the story \u201ca lie.\u201d",

      "Sean Baker's Brooklyn comedy \u201cAnora\u201d took top honors at both the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night, catapulting it to Oscar favorite status with wins from a pair of closely watched Academy Awards precursors.",
      "Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged \u201cAnora\u201d as the frontrunner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival.",

Since 2009, when the guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they've corresponded all but three times.",
      "The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees.",
      "The guild also named RaMell Ross' \u201cNickel Boys\" best first film. Ross' movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative film debut.",

      "Security at the stadium detained the performer shortly after waving the flag atop a car used as a prop in the performance. It's unclear if the performer, as of yet unnamed by authorities, would face any charges. The NFL said the person would be banned for life from NFL stadiums and events, while the company behind the halftime show said it was not part of the planned performance.",
      "But what's happening in Gaza and Sudan? And how does it affect the wider world?",
      "The Associated Press explains what's going on.",
      "The Gaza Strip is an enclave along the Mediterranean Sea bordered by both Egypt and Israel. It's some 360 square kilometers (140 square miles) \u2014 about the twice the size of Washington and 3\u00bd times the size of Paris. But it's incredibly densely populated and was home to 2.3 million Palestinians before the start of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war.",
      "That war began when Hamas, a militant group that's ruled Gaza since 2007, stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Israel responded with a devastating ground and air campaign striking across Gaza, killing more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Much of the territory has been obliterated.",
      "A ceasefire in the war began Jan. 19 and is still holding. Palestinian militants have freed hostages while Israel has released Palestinians held in prisons there. However, worries remains over whether the peace will hold. Comments by President Donald Trump, who was on hand Sunday night for the Super Bowl, suggesting the U.S. was \u201ccommitted to buying and owning Gaza,\u201d also have upended discussions about the enclave's future.",
      "The Palestinians want the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a future state of their own, with east Jerusalem as its capital. That long-sought, two-state solution for the decadeslong conflict is backed by Mideast nations and much of the international community. Israel has expressed openness to the idea of resettling Gaza\u2019s population, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Sunday calling it \u201da revolutionary, creative vision.\" Hamas, the Palestinians and much of the world have rejected it.",
      "Sudan, a nation in East Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led a military coup in 2021.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "In recent weeks, Burhan's forces including Sudan's military and allied militias have advanced against the RSF. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum, Sudan's capital. They've also pushed in on RSF positions around Khartoum itself. That fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties. From Jan. 31 until Feb. 5, the U.N.s' Human Rights Office documented at least 275 civilian deaths from artillery, airstrikes and drone assaults.",
      "\u201cIndiscriminate attacks, as well as threats and attacks directed against civilians must cease immediately,\u201d said Seif Magango, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Office. \u201cThe Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces \u2014 and their allied movements and militias \u2014 must respect their international law obligations and take concrete steps to protect civilians from harm, including humanitarian workers and human rights defenders.\u201d",
      "Online, activists have sought to draw attention to both the Gaza Strip and Sudan, though the conflicts have different roots and participants. However, the idea of the two conflicts being linked by their devastation has been made by celebrities.",
      "In August, American rapper Macklemore said he canceled a concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates\u2019 role \u201cin the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis\u201d in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that\u2019s been fighting government troops there. While the UAE repeatedly has denied arming the RSF, U.N. experts reported \u201ccredible\u201d evidence last year showed that the Emirates sent weapons to the RSF several times a week from northern Chad.",
      "Macklemore at the time said he reconsidered the show in part over his recent, public support of Palestinians over the Israel-Hamas war. He has been performing a song called \u201cHind\u2019s Hall,\u201d in honor of a young girl named Hind Rajab killed in Gaza in a shooting Palestinians have blamed on Israeli forces opening fire on a civilian car."

      "NEW YORK -- Former Prime Minister of Finland Sanna Marin will have a memoir out this fall, looking back on a momentous four years in office when she led an all-female governing coalition, presided over her country's joining NATO and enacted legislation on climate change and social justice.",
      "Scribner announced that Marin's \u201cHope in Action: A Memoir about the Courage to Lead\u201d will be published Nov. 4.",
      "\"The world is increasingly complex. Geopolitical turmoil and rivalry are challenging the rules-based international order. Climate change and the loss of biodiversity are threatening our very existence. We are also witnessing pushback on gender equality and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights,\u201d Marin said in a statement issued through Scribner. \u201cDespite all of the challenges we are facing, we have to remember \u2013 there is hope if there is action. I hope that through my story, I can encourage people to take a stance and act for the change they want to see in the world.\"",
      "Scribner is calling the book \u201ca rare, personal account\u201d of \u201cpivotal events.\u201d",
      "Marin was just 34 when elected in 2019, as part of a center-left coalition that made history by being led entirely by women. She became known internationally for her opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and for Finland's rapid entry into NATO, ending a policy of neutrality that had been in place since the end of World War II.",
      "At times, her private life made news. In August 2022, she apologized after the publication of a photo that showed two women kissing and posing topless at the prime minister's official summer residence. Earlier, a video of Marin dancing and singing with friends prompted a debate about how a head of state should behave during her leisure time and whether women were held to a different standard.",
      "Marin left politics in 2023 and has since joined the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change as a strategic counselor."

      "NEW YORK -- On a quiet winter weekend at the box office, DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u201cDog Man\u201d chased its own tail, repeating as the top movie in theaters.",
      "The animated Universal Pictures release, adapted from Dav Pilkey\u2019s popular graphic novel series, collected $13.7 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Both new releases \u2013 the Ke Huy Quan action movie \u201cLove Hurts\u201d and the Valentine\u2019s Day-themed slasher \u201cHeart Eyes\u201d \u2013 were left nipping at the heels of \u201cDog Man.\u201d",
      "Hollywood often largely punts Super Bowl weekend to the small screen. Last year, Apple\u2019s much-derided \u201cArgylle\u201d debuted on the same weekend. Instead, the movie industry spends more energy pitching its blockbusters in trailers for the huge football audience on TV.",
      "It wasn\u2019t a banner weekend for \u201cDog Man.\u201d It fell steeply, dropping 62% in it second weekend. But with a production budget of $40 million, \u201cDog Man\u201d has already tallied $54.1 million domestically in two weeks.",
      "Coming in second was Spyglass Media Group\u2019s \u201cHeart Eyes,\u201d released by Sony. The horror-rom-com mashup earned $8.5 million from 3,102 locations. Reviews have been good for the film, directed by Josh Ruben and starring Oliva Holt and Mason Gooding, though audiences were less impressed. Moviegoers gave it a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore. Spyglass made \u201cHeart Eyes\u201d for $18 million.",
      "\u201cLove Hurts,\u201d the action comedy from 87North Productions (\u201cJohn Wick,\u201d \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d), debuted with a paltry $5.8 million in 3,055 theaters. In his first big movie role since his Oscar-winning comeback in \u201cEverything All at Once,\u201d Ke Huy Quan stars as a mild-mannered realtor with a hitman past. Ariana DeBose co-stars. It, too, was modestly budgeted at $18 million. Audiences, however, mostly rejected the movie, giving \u201cLove Hurts\u201d a \u201cC+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Next weekend should bring Hollywood its biggest box-office weekend of the year with the release of Marvel\u2019s \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d and Sony\u2019s \u201cPaddington in Peru.\u201d",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",

      "Tom Robbins, the literary prankster-philosopher who charmed, enlightened and addled millions of readers with such adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Tom Robbins, the novelist and prankster-philosopher who charmed and addled millions of readers with such screwball adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died. He was 92.",
      "Robbins\u2019 death was confirmed by his friend, the publishing executive Craig Popelars, who said the author died Sunday morning.",
      "Pronouncing himself blessed with \"crazy wisdom,\" Robbins published eight novels and the memoir \"Tibetan Peach Pie\" and looked fondly upon his world of deadpan absurdity, authorial commentary and zig zag story lines. No one had a wilder imagination, whether giving us a wayward heroine with elongated thumbs in \"Cowgirls\" or landing the corpse of Jesus in a makeshift zoo in \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" And no one told odder jokes on himself: Robbins once described his light, scratchy drawl as sounding \"as if it's been strained through Davy Crockett's underwear.\"",
      "He could fathom almost anything except growing up. People magazine would label Robbins \"the perennial flower child and wild blooming Peter Pan of American letters,\" who \"dips history's pigtails in weird ink and splatters his graffiti over the face of modern fiction.\"",
      "A native of Blowing Rock, North Carolina who moved to Virginia and was named \"Most Mischievous Boy\" by his high school, Robbins could match any narrative in his books with one about his life. There was the time he had to see a proctologist and showed up wearing a duck mask. (The doctor and Robbins became friends). He liked to recall the food server in Texas who unbuttoned her top and revealed a faded autograph, his autograph.",
      "Or that odd moment in the 1990s when the FBI sought clues to the Unabomber's identity by reading Robbins' novel \"Still Life with Woodpecker.\" Robbins would allege that two federal agents, both attractive women, were sent to interview him.",
      "\"The FBI is not stupid!\" he liked to say. \"They knew my weakness!\"",
      "He also managed to meet a few celebrities, thanks in part to the film adaptation of \"Even Cowgirls,\" which starred Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves, and to appearances in such movies as \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.\" He wrote of being Debra Winger's date to the 1991 Academy Awards ceremony and nearly killing himself at an Oscars after-party when \u2014 hoping to impress Al Pacino \u2014 he swallowed a glass of cologne. He had happier memories of checking into a hotel and being recognized by a young, pretty clerk, who raved about his work and ignored the man standing next to him, Neil Young.",
      "In Robbins\u2019 novels, the quest was all and he helped capture the wide open spirit of the 1960s in part because he knew the life so well. He dropped acid, hitchhiked coast to coast, traveled from Tanzania to the Himalayas and carried on with friends and strangers in ways he had no right to survive. He didn't rely on topical references to mark time, but on understanding the era from the inside.",
      "\"Faulkner had his inbred Southern gothic freak show, Hemingway his European battlefields and cafes, Melville his New England with its tall ships,\" he wrote in his memoir, published in 2014. \"I had, it finally dawned on me, a cultural phenomenon such as the world had not quite seen before, has not seen since; a psychic upheaval, a paradigm shift, a widespread if ultimately unsustainable egalitarian leap in consciousness. And it was all very up close and personal.\"",
      "His path to fiction writing had its own rambling, hallucinatory quality. He was a dropout from Washington and Lee University (Tom Wolfe was a classmate) who joined the Air Force because he didn't know what else to do. He moved to the Pacific Northwest in the early '60s and somehow was assigned to review an opera for the Seattle Times, becoming the first classical music critic to liken Rossini to Robert Mitchum. Robbins would soon find himself in a farcical meeting with conductor Milton Katims, making conversation by pretending he was working on his own libretto, \"The Gypsy of Issaquah,\" named for a Seattle suburb.",
      "\"You must admit it had an operatic ring,\" Robbins insisted.",
      "By the late 1960s, publishers were hearing about his antics and thought he might have a book in him. A Doubleday editor met with Robbins and agreed to pay $2,500 for what became \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" Published in 1971, Robbins' debut novel sold little in hardcover despite praise from Graham Greene and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, but became a hit in paperback. \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" came out in 1976 and eventually sold more than 1 million copies.",
      "\"Read solemnly, with expectations of conventional coherence, \u2018Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\u2019 will disappoint,\" Thomas LeClair wrote in The New York Times. \"Entered like a garage sale, poked through and picked over, \u2018Cowgirls\u2019 is entertaining and, like the rippled mirror over there by the lawn mower, often instructive. Tom Robbins is one of our best practitioners of high foolishness.\u201d",
      "Domestic stability was another prolonged adventure; one ex-girlfriend complained \u201cThe trouble with you, Tom, is that you have too much fun.\u201d He was married and divorced twice, and had three children, before settling down with his third wife, Alexa d'Avalon, who appeared in the film version of \u201cEven Cowgirls Get the Blues.\u201d",
      "Robbins' other books included \"Half Asleep in Frogs Pajamas,\" \"Fierce Invalids Home from Home Climates,\" \u201cVilla Incognito.\u201d His honors included the Bumbershoot Golden Umbrella Award for Lifetime Achievement and being named by Writer's Digest as among the 100 best authors of the 20th century. But he cherished no praise more than a letter received from an unnamed woman.",
      "\"Your books make me laugh, they make think, they make me horny,\" his fan informed him, \u201cand they make me aware of all the wonder in the world.\u201d"

      "Jon Batiste turned his Super Bowl opportunity into a symphony of artistry, the debut of new music and a tribute to his hometown roots",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Jon Batiste transformed the Super Bowl stage into a symphony of creativity, debuting new music, reimagining \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\" and shining a global spotlight on his wife's creative vision.",
      "As Batiste performed the national anthem Sunday, the multi-talented musician played a piano adorned with a colorful butterfly painting by his wife, Suleika Jaouad, who came up with the idea while making their documentary \u201cAmerican Symphony.\u201d Her artwork, the city\u2019s resilience after the New Year\u2019s attack, and the memory of his late veteran grandfather all fueled his performance.",
      "\u201cThis was powerful. The spirit came over me,\u201d Batiste told The Associated Press after his performance at the Caesars Superdome. On Monday he unveiled \u201cMy United State,\u201d a two-track project featuring \u201cStar-Spangled Blues\u201d and \u201cNotes from My Future Self.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in the history of the anthem that had samples included in it,\u201d said Batiste, a Louisiana native who is a Grammy and Oscar winner and former bandleader for the \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d \u201cWe almost couldn\u2019t clear the main sample that I wanted until the night before.\u201d",
      "Batiste, 38, said his reinvented national anthem draws from \u201cDrag Rap\u201d by The Showboys \u2014 better known as the Triggerman beat \u2014 a staple of New Orleans bounce and hip-hop culture. He aimed to showcase the city's rich culture and heritage while putting his own stamp on a song that was first echoed at the Super Bowl in 1967, performed by The Pride of Arizona, the Michigan Marching Band and the UCLA Choir.",
      "Over the years, the anthem has been reimagined by music legends like Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Billy Joel, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pieces to the puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all come in different tempos and melodies. It\u2019s a whole lot of things that wouldn\u2019t never work together unless it was framed by the American ideal. I wanted to capture it in an arrangement. Just in the sound.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, Batiste reflected on his wife\u2019s resilience, new songs, an upcoming tour and his festival this weekend that will leave a lasting musical impact on New Orleans.",
      "During the filming of \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d inspiration struck \u2014 not just in the documentary, but on canvas. As Jaouad painted, one creation that took flight was a vivid butterfly, embodying what he calls the \u201cpower of resilience, delicate beauty, and grace.\u201d",
      "Jaouad's painting was on the piano and bench Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt's the balance of this duality,\u201d he said about watching his wife creatively express herself during \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d which won a Grammy for best music film. \u201cIt Never Went Away\u201d from the documentary also won best song written for visual media. He's thankful for the collaboration and proud of Jaouad, a writer who is battling cancer for a third time.",
      "In December, she revealed her diagnosis on social media.",
      "\u201cShe's a one of a kind human being, like a person who has so much light from within,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cYou look into her eyes and you see the work. I'm very glad that she was able to not only survive, but have this alchemizing process of it all to lift it into something that's even more than just a way of making lemonade out of lemons.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis is more than just taking a bad thing and making it good. It's almost a blessing, as wild as it is to think about it like that.\u201d",
      "While crafting \u201cNotes from My Future Self,\u201d Batiste had three things on his mind: returning home, the national anthem and the wide-eyed wonder of him at 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt really brought together so many things in my subconscious,\u201d said the seven-time Grammy winner. \"It brought them together, like all these stories, notes. What would the young me think about what\u2019s happening now and how to really connect to this moment from their inner child plays in this song? It just came out of that.\u201d",
      "Batiste called the upbeat song an anthem that represents self-empowerment for himself and others too. He said making the song was a profound journey of artistic realization.",
      "\u201cWhen you hear the song and you\u2019re listening, it\u2019s me talking to my younger me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it could also be you, talking to young you. In a moment like this, it\u2019s important for us to heal, to really thrive and be rooted in who we are. We have to go back to that kid.\u201d",
      "Batiste said the musical foundation came while talking to director Alan Ferguson, his frequent collaborator. He said they had a vision of using spoken word, poetry and hip-hop within the context of \u201cradical cause, positivity and openness.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of life,\u201d he said. \u201dIt's a natural intuition and the visual possibility and the evolution of me as an artist is just me going into this new zone. ... When it aligns like that, that's how I know it's the right direction.\"",
      "After Batiste's Super Bowl performance, his next goal is creating visuals for \u201cNotes from My Future Self\" and hitting the road for a concert tour.",
      "Full details have to yet been released, but he's looking to perform new music and songs from Beethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1),\u201d which reimagined the iconic German pianist\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cYou really get a twofer on this next run,\u201d Batiste said.",
      "Before delivering the national anthem, Jon Batiste brought his signature energy to New Orleans\u2019 9th Ward, turning a neighborhood into a stage for joy and community.",
      "His He Gets Us Presents Jon Batiste\u2019s Love Riot Festival transformed the grounds of George Washington Carver High School into a celebration of music, hope, and action. The event also highlighted plans for a future sports field to serve local schools.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make something where we go to the places that are forgotten but are the foundation,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cThey are the foundation of why we want to come to New Orleans in the first place and go to those communities.\u201d",
      "Batiste, alongside Sing for Hope, led 10 New Orleans artists in creating hand-painted pianos, scattered throughout the 9th Ward as an open invitation to the festival. After the event, these vibrant instruments will find permanent homes in schools and community centers, keeping the music alive long after the final note.",
      "\u201cThey greatest thing we can do is serve and not take it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a holistic view. ... Yes, I\u2019m honored to sing at the Super Bowl. I also want to leave something that impacts the community, my hometown.\u201d",

His novel will bring back Dr. Wilbur Larch from \u201cThe Cider House Rules,\u201d but otherwise features a new set of characters. According to Simon & Schuster, \u201cQueen Esther\u201d will span much of the 20th century as it follows the life of Esther Nacht, a Viennese Jew born in 1905, abandoned at age 4 and taken in as a teen by a New England family.",

      "\u201cThe construction of this novel long predates the events of Oct. 7, and everything that\u2019s happened in Israel since those terrorist attacks and the hostage-taking,\" Irving said in a statement. \u201cWith hindsight, it\u2019s easy to say that what I saw and heard in Israel in the early 1980s serves as a precursor to what has developed since that time, but this is what historical fiction is for.\u201d",

      "Federal government payments for subscriptions to media outlets have become the latest target of President Donald Trump's spending hawks",
      "NEW YORK -- Federal government payments to news outlets like Politico, The New York Times and The Associated Press for subscriptions or to license content are in the crosshairs of Trump administration spending hawks, with the president on Thursday calling it potentially \u201cTHE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the latest in a series of skirmishes with the media, long a target of Donald Trump and his supporters. The Defense Department last week evicted NPR, NBC, the Times and Politico from their Pentagon workspaces, and Trump has continued to criticize CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d for its handling of an interview with former opponent Kamala Harris last fall. Free press advocates are also concerned about Trump\u2019s plans for the media outlet Voice of America, whose charter guarantees its editorial freedom.",
      "This time, though, is a bit different. By linking federal government spending to the media, Trump has bundled two of his long-favored political targets into one rhetorical package \u2014 denouncing a common practice as untoward while offering no supporting evidence for his assertions.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the government had paid more than $8 million for Politico subscriptions and that Elon Musk's government efficiency team \u201cis working on canceling those payments.\u201d That quickly set off a social-media maelstrom and a hunt by online sleuths for other evidence of taxpayer spending on the news.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government must stop paying for media subscriptions. Now,\u201d Richard Grenell, Trump's special mission envoy, posted on X.",
      "Trump, on his Truth Social platform, complained about payments to the \u201cFAKE NEWS MEDIA\u201d for creating good stories about Democrats. \u201cDid the New York Times receive money??? Who else did??? THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL,\u201d he wrote.",
      "And at a national prayer breakfast at the Capitol on Thursday morning, Trump touted the efforts to look into the media spending. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them left and right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them. We\u2019re catching them to a point where they don\u2019t know what the heck is going on. They can\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting caught.\u201d",
      "Politico, in a statement to readers from CEO Goli Sheikholeslami and Editor-in-Chief John Harris, said Thursday that it is not getting a government subsidy.",
      "\u201cIt is a transaction \u2014 just as the government buys research, equipment, software and industry reports,\" they said. \"Some online voices are deliberately spreading falsehoods. Let's be clear: Politico has no financial dependence on the government and no hidden agenda. We cover politics and policy \u2014 that's our job.\"",
      "It has not been unusual for governments, federal and state, to subscribe to major media outlets to keep up on important or strategic issues. The U.S. State Department, for example, may depend on international news reporting for clarity on incidents happening in countries where the United States has interests. Specialists in an agency like the Department of Transportation follow trade publications for industry trends.",
      "The Politico Pro service helps government and private sector customers \"track policy, legislation and regulations in real time with news, intelligence and a suite of data products,\" the company said. It would not discuss how many subscriptions it has sold, or the prices.",
      "The New York Times said it earned less than $2 million last year through government subscriptions, which are offered at a discounted rate. Through one arrangement, the Times gives access to more than 1 million active and retired military members and their families.",
      "\u201cThese officials and other public servants are simply seeking to better understand the world through our independent journalism, like millions of other Americans,\u201d spokesman Charlie Stadtlander said.",
      "Musk, also a frequent critic of the mainstream media and the owner of a platform that in many ways competes with it, retweeted one message on X that complained about the AP \u201craking in millions of dollars in government money for years.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot for long,\" Musk added. \u201dThis is obviously a huge waste of taxpayer money.\"",
      "AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said that \u201cthe U.S. government has long been an AP customer \u2014 through both Democratic and Republican administrations. It licenses AP's nonpartisan journalism, just like thousands of news outlets and customers around the world. It's quite common for governments to have contracts with news organizations for their content.\u201d",
      "The outlet would not reveal how much it is earning in federal government contracts.",
      "Separately, Musk's focus on the USAID agency has threatened some $268 million in congressionally-authorized funding aimed at offering training and support to some 6,200 independent journalists working around the world, including in war-torn Ukraine, said the organization Reporters Without Borders.",
      "Denying the money \u201cwill create a vacuum that plays into the hands of propagandists and authoritarian states,\u201d said Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders' USA branch.",

But if you want to see them in all their ruby-red glory from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d there\u2019s no place like home \u2014 their current home, that is, at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles.",
      "There, Dorothy\u2019s shoes, worn by Judy Garland, are now on display as part of a sweeping exhibit on the history of color in cinema. It\u2019s a history in which the sequined slippers play a key role.",
      "While the 1900 novel by Frank L. Baum described them as silver, filmmakers in 1939 wanted to pack as much color as possible into the scene where Dorothy steps from sepia-toned Kansas into the shimmering color of the Land of Oz, where Glinda gives her the shoes off the feet of the Wicked Witch of the East. They were showing off a new technology: Technicolor.",
      "The exhibit, \u201cColor in Motion: Chromatic Explorations of Cinema,\u201d running through July 13, is timely not only because everything Oz is new again.",
      "It also highlights the largely unsung role that women played in the development of color in Hollywood, not only on screen but off, where labor-intensive jobs like hand-coloring and stenciling gave them a foothold in a male-dominated industry.",
      "There's also a fanciful interactive installation where your own body creates cinematic explosions of color, on the spot.",
      "Here are some highlights:",
      "Those glistening slippers nestled against a wall \u2014 rather unobtrusively, given their iconic status \u2014 began their life as white silk pumps. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d costume designer Adrian (known by his first name) dyed them red and embellished them with nearly 5,000 sequins.",
      "One of four known pairs used for the film that still exist, they were secured with great fanfare and help from luminaries like Leonardo DiCaprio, and were displayed when the museum opened in September 2021.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re certainly one of the biggest treasures we have in our collection,\u201d says Jessica Niebel, curator of the color show. \u201cEver since they came down, we\u2019ve gotten regular visitor feedback asking to see the ruby red slippers back on display. This was the perfect opportunity.\u201d",
      "The shoes are silver in both Baum\u2019s 1900 novel and in Gregory Maguire's 1995 book \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,\u201d on which the Broadway show and movie are based.",
      "Some nine years after \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d another movie put a pair of red shoes front and center. They were ballet pointe shoes, and the film, fittingly, was \u201cThe Red Shoes.\u201d",
      "The sad story of a young ballerina forced to choose between her career and a romance, the movie , by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, starred Moira Shearer, a real-life ballerina. Its tragic 17-minute dance sequence tells a story within a story \u2014 a young woman who dances in the red shoes until she dies.",
      "Curators placed these prized red pointe shoes front and center because, Niebel says, \u201cThe Red Shoes\u201d highlights both the magical nature of red and the role color plays in the expression of physical movement through dance.",
      "Poignantly, the pointe shoes are not perfect, but worn \u2014 just as the character\u2019s white dress turns gray and dirty as she is gradually consumed.",
      "Silent films were in black and white, right?",
      "Well, no, actually. In this gallery, silent film excerpts show that many were in color. \u201cIn the 1920s, most films, 80-90%, we think, were in color,\u201d Niebel says. \u201cThey only became black and white with the arrival of sound.\u201d",
      "Before that, the majority of films where were tinted and toned, curators say, meaning an entire filmstrip is submerged in one color, often a bright one like yellow or pink or red or blue.",
      "Curators went to four film archives in Europe and the U.S. and scanned their filmstrips. \u201cIn this gallery, for the first time, you can see how these colors authentically looked in the 1920s without any digital manipulation,\u201d Niebel says.",
      "Another section describes a phenomenon many know nothing about: leader ladies. These were women who appeared in the lead frame of a film reel to be processed in a color lab. They were invisible to audiences, but used to calibrate and process the color in a film.",
      "The display raises the issue that this process, which has disappeared with the digital age, largely excluded people of color.",
      "\u201cPredominantly they used to be white women,\u201d Niebel says. \u201cSo film stock and film materials were calibrated towards white skin predominantly. We wanted to tell this story as well \u2014 the story of these women who are never named, who the public never saw, but also the story of how film stock was developed particularly to depict white skin.\u201d",
      "The show begins with images of Lo\u00efe Fuller and the Serpentine Dance she invented, where colored light was reflected onto a flowing costume, changing the colors. An American dancer, Fuller experimented in the early 20th century with fabric, movement, and color techniques like gels and chemical salts.",
      "But many other women toiled in obscurity. There were, for example, the women at Disney, as the studio made a transition to color. We learn that under the leadership of Walt Disney's sister-in-law Hazel Sewell, the studio's ink and paint department became the animation industry\u2019s first all-female unit.",
      "And the French production company Path\u00e9 employed young women to hand-paint films \u2014 frame by frame \u2014 early in the 20th century. These young women earned less than their male counterparts. Still, it was more than they were able to earn in other professions.",
      "As kids know from finger painting, there\u2019s nothing more fun than making color yourself \u2014 especially color that moves. That\u2019s the takeaway from a final gallery in which your own physical movement creates cascades of color.",
      "\u201cBody Paint,\u201d by artist Memo Akten, allows you to stand in front of a screen, spread your arms, jump up and down or move any which way you want as a camera translates the moves into color.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s time for visitors to become animators of colors themselves through their own bodies,\u201d Niebel says. She's seen people stop and perform full-on dances at the installation.",

      "Lawmakers in some states are pushing measures to crack down on abortion pills or penalize women who obtain abortions",
      "Lawmakers in some states where abortion is already banned are seeking to explicitly bar abortion pills or take a step that most leading anti-abortion groups oppose: punish women who seek to end their pregnancies.",
      "It's too early in some legislative sessions to know whether the measures will get serious consideration. But it does show that the policy debate continues to evolve following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans on abortion.",
      "Here's a look at where things stand:",
      "Lawmakers in several states have introduced measures to classify the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 which are used together in the majority of U.S. abortions \u2014 as controlled dangerous substances, making it a crime to possess them without prescriptions.",
      "Louisiana last year became the first state to adopt such a law, despite concerns from doctors who contended that the restrictions would make it harder for them to access the drugs to perform life-saving procedures.",
      "The measures have been introduced in states where Republicans control the government and where there are bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions.",
      "The legislation has died or appears unlikely to advance in Indiana and Mississippi.",
      "Elsewhere \u2014 including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas \u2014 it's too early to know whether they have a chance.",
      "In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch opponent of abortion, has vowed to sign any anti-abortion measure that comes to his desk.",
      "And one scholar who follows abortion policy said that the bills can affect the debate even if they don't pick up momentum.",
      "\u201cThe more often that they\u2019re introduced, the more normalized these sorts of bills and these sorts of concepts that they\u2019re pushing become,\u201d said Laura Hermer, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota.",
      "Authorities in two states with stringent abortion laws have targeted a New York doctor for allegedly sending abortion pills to patients in those states.",
      "Last month, a Louisiana grand jury indicted Dr. Maggie Carpenter on charges of criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Carpenter in civil court under similar circumstances.",
      "The legal actions set up a test of laws in some Democratic-controlled states, including New York, that seek to protect health care providers who use telehealth to prescribe and then mail abortion pills to patients in states where they're banned. New York officials say they will not extradite the doctor to Louisiana.",
      "Since Carpenter's indictment, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a law that allows doctors to leave their names off prescription bottles for abortion pills as a way to further insulate them. Similar legislation has been introduced in Maine.",
      "The attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are also suing in federal court to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone and bar prescriptions for it by telehealth.",
      "Some advocates are calling on President Donald Trump to enforce an 1873 law to ban mailing medication or instruments used in abortion, but he has not done so.",
      "While critics say the drugs are unsafe, some major medical groups disagree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is decades of evidence that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective. The group cited a study showing that major adverse events such as significant infection and excessive blood loss occur in less than 0.32% of patients taking mifepristone for a medication abortion. Medical organizations say mifepristone\u2019s safety compares to that of the over-the-counter pain medication ibuprofen.",
      "Bills in several states would open the door to criminal charges against women who seek or obtain abortions on charges including murder.",
      "That's a step no state has taken so far, and which leading anti-abortion groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and the National Right to Life Committee oppose.",
      "Still, such bills have been introduced in Idaho and Indiana, where they're unlikely to advance, and Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Carolina, where they're all early in the legislative process.",
      "Reached by phone, South Carolina Rep. Luke Rankin, a Republican who added his name to a list of bill sponsors last week, said, \u201cI've always been pro-life.\u201d When asked about the provision to allow prosecution of women seeking abortion, he said: \u201cI can't help you there\u201d and declined to answer questions.",

    "story": [
      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

      "Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations' climate chief calls \u201camong the most important policy documents governments will produce this century\u201d \u2014 their plans on how they will cut emissions of heat-trapping gases.",
      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",
      "The deadline \u2014 set in the Paris agreement to be nine months before the next international climate negotiations, this year in Belem, Brazil \u2014 is 11:59 p.m. in Germany, where the U.N. climate office is.",
      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

      "Individuals who are willing and able to challenge the status quo are becoming less hesitant to describe the payoffs of taking a dose of microsleep. Marvin Stockwell, the founder of PR firm Champion the Cause, takes short naps several times a week.",
      "\u201cThey rejuvenate me in a way that I\u2019m exponentially more useful and constructive and creative on the other side of a nap than I am when I\u2019m forcing myself to gut through being tired,\u201d Stockwell said.",
      "Sleep is as important to good health as diet and exercise, but too many people don\u2019t get enough of it, according to James Rowley, program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Rush University Medical Center.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with electronics. It used to be TVs, but now cellphones are probably the biggest culprit. People just take them to bed with them and watch,\u201d Rowley said.\u201d",
      "Napping isn\u2019t common in academia, where there\u2019s constant pressure to publish, but University of Southern California lecturer Julianna Kirschner fits in daytime naps when she can. Kirschner studies social media, which she says is designed to deliver a dopamine rush to the brain. Viewers lose track of time on the platforms, interrupting sleep. Kirschner says she isn\u2019t immune to this problem \u2014 hence, her occasional need to nap.",
      "The key to effective napping is to keep the snooze sessions short, Rowley said. Short naps can be restorative and are more likely to leave you more alert, he said.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize naps should be in the 15- to 20-minute range,\u201d Rowley said. \u201cAnything longer, and you can have problems with sleep inertia, difficulty waking up, and you\u2019re groggy.\u201d",
      "Individuals who find themselves consistently relying on naps to make up for inadequate sleep should probably also examine their bedtime habits, he said.",
      "Mid-afternoon is the ideal time for a nap because it coincides with a natural circadian dip, while napping after 6 p.m. may interfere with nocturnal sleep for those who work during daylight hours, said Michael Chee, director of the Centre for Sleep and Cognition at the National University of Singapore.",
      "\u201cAny duration of nap, you will feel recharged. It\u2019s a relief valve. There are clear cognitive benefits,\u201d Chee said.",
      "A review of napping studies suggests that 30 minutes is the optimal nap length in terms of practicality and benefits, said Ruth Leong, a research fellow at the Singapore center.",
      "\u201cWhen people nap for too long, it may not be a sustainable practice, and also, really long naps that cross the two-hour mark affect nighttime sleep,\u201d Leong said.",
      "Experts recommend setting an alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, which gives nappers a few minutes to fall asleep.",
      "But even a six-minute nap can be restorative and improve learning, said Valentin Dragoi, scientific director of the Center for Neural Systems Restoration, a research and treatment facility run by Houston Methodist hospital and Rice University.",
      "While workplace dozing is uncommon in the U.S., some companies and managers encourage it. Will Bryk, founder of AI search startup Exa, swears by 20-minute power naps and ordered two sleeping pods for employees to use in his company's San Francisco office.",
      "Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry\u2019s has had a nap room in its Vermont headquarters for a couple of decades, and a handful of employees use it, company spokesman Sean Greenwood said. \u201cEmployees who feel taken care of are much more likely to use this responsibly,\" he said.",
      "Arianna Huffington, the celebrity author who co-founded the news website Huffington Post, became an advocate of a good night\u2019s sleep and occasional naps after she collapsed from exhaustion in 2007. She installed a nap room at her former company, now called HuffPo, and at Thrive Global, a wellness technology company where she serves as founder and CEO.",
      "\u201cIf people have been up all night because of a sick child or a delayed flight, if they have the opportunity to nap, ... then they will be much more productive and creative for the rest of the day instead of dragging themselves or trying to boost their energy through multiple coffees or cinnamon buns,\u201d Huffington said in an email.",
      "Kirsten Perez, 33, is a devoted napper. She used to use her lunch break at work to catch a few winks in her car. When she got her own office, she closed the door for a siesta while sitting at her desk.",
      "Nowadays, working from home as a marketing manager at Nvidia, the Atlanta resident usually takes her daily nap in bed. She sets an alarm for 15 minutes, falls asleep within a minute and wakes up 30 seconds before the alarm rings.",
      "\u201cI can tell when my reasoning, my mood are dropping, just kind of feeling the drag of the day,\u201d Perez said. In those situations, she asks herself, \u201c\u2018Do I have a chunk of time in the next hour or so?\u2019 And then I\u2019ll figure out when I can find 15 minutes and find myself horizontal.\u201d",
      "Naps are accepted and even a necessity in some occupations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages naps for nurses working night shifts. But many nurses can't sleep at the hospitals where they work because they're too busy and aren't given access to beds.",
      "Nurses \"regularly struggle to have sufficient time to use the bathroom or go outside for fresh air, no less take a nap,\" Michelle Morris, spokesperson for the National Nurses United union, said.",
      "Some companies are trying to fill the void. Inspired by his mother who worked as a nurse, Neil Wong founded Nap York, which offers sleeping pods in Manhattan and Queens that can be rented for about $27 an hour.",
      "His regular customers include super-commuters, UPS drivers, a security guard who works two full-time jobs, and doctors who work at nearby hospitals. Nap York also gives half-off prices to essential workers such as police officers, firefighters and emergency medical service personnel.",
      "\u201cIn this society, you really only have two place to sleep: you have your bed at home and you have a hotel room you can probably get for 100 bucks,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no third space that\u2019s quiet, that provides some privacy, where you can also rest.\u201d",

      "Black women in the U.S. died at a rate nearly 3.5 times higher than white women around the time of childbirth in 2023",
      "NEW YORK -- Black women in the U.S. died at a rate nearly 3.5 times higher than white women around the time of childbirth in 2023, as maternal mortality fell below prepandemic levels overall but racial gaps widened, according to federal health data released Wednesday.",
      "In 2021 and 2022, the maternal death rate for Black women was about 2.6 times higher than white women.",
      "The data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic, at its peak, impacted all pregnant women. But \u201conce we went back to \u2018usual activities,\u2019 then the impact of systemic racism and unequal access (to medical care) ... came right back into place,\u201d said Dr. Amanda Williams, interim medical director for the March of Dimes.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's report Wednesday on the 2023 deaths was drawn from death certificates. The CDC counts women who died while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth. Accidental deaths are excluded.",
      "The report found:",
      "\u2014 The maternal death rate for white women dropped from 19 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022 to 14.5 per 100,000 in 2023.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Black women went from 49.5 to a little above 50, though the report says that increase was not statistically significant.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Hispanic women dropped from about 17 to about 12.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Asian Americans fell from about 13 to about 11.",
      "In total, 669 women died in 2023 during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth, the CDC reported. That\u2019s down from 817 deaths in 2022 and 1,205 in 2021, when it was the highest in more than 50 years.",
      "Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes of maternal deaths.",
      "Among those infections is COVID-19. The coronavirus and its complications proved dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "COVID-19\u2019s overall impact on pregnancies declined as the pandemic subsided and as hospitals and birthing centers returned to normal operations.",
      "Also, the federal Medicaid program expanded to cover postpartum care for up to 12 months, instead of just seven weeks. That helped more moms recover and made them healthier for the next time they tried to have a baby, Williams said.",
      "The number of maternal deaths is also tied to the number of pregnancies. U.S. births have been declining, and fewer pregnancies contributes to fewer pregnancy-related deaths, noted Eugene Declercq, a maternal deaths researcher at Boston University.",
      "CDC officials refused an Associated Press request to talk to a report author.",
      "The government is still receiving and processing death reports from last year. But Declercq said his analysis of available data suggests the number of 2024 maternal deaths may end up about the same as 2023.",

      "",
      "Asked by Cassidy what reforms he would propose, Kennedy replied, \"Well, I don't have a proposal for dismantling the program.\" He later gave vague responses to Cassidy's question about how he would improve programs for dual eligibles, some 12 million beneficiaries  --  often with complex health issues  --  who are eligible for Medicare but because of their low income, are also eligible for Medicaid.",
      "",
      "\"Well, dual eligibles are not right now served very well into the system,\" Kennedy replied. \"And you know I suppose my answer to that is to make sure that the programs are consolidated, they're integrated, and the care is integrated. I look forward to working with you, Dr. Cassidy, on making sure that we take good care of people.\"",
      "",
      "Cassidy then asked how he proposed to integrate the programs. \"Does Medicare pay more? Medicare pay less? Medicaid pay more? Medicaid pay less? How do we do that?\"",
      "",
      "\"I'm not exactly sure, because I'm not in there. I mean, it is difficult to integrate them ...\" he replied, ultimately saying, \"I do not know the answer to that. I look forward to exploring options.\"",
      "",
      "Kennedy also said that Medicare beneficiaries would \"rather be on Medicare Advantage because it offers very good services. People can't afford it. It's much more expensive.\"",
      "",
      "In fact, MA plan beneficiaries generally pay no or very low premiums and choose their plans because of low or non-existent upfront costs. However, it is true that MA plans generally cost the trust fund a lot more than if the same beneficiaries were in traditional Medicare  --  $82 billion more in 2023 according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.",
      "",
      "At another point, Kennedy said that Medicaid is \"fully paid for by the federal government,\" when in fact it is paid through a mix of state and federal money, with states contributing between 17% and 41% in fiscal year 2023. That's an important concept to understand, since each Medicaid program's coverage and eligibility requirements can vary enormously through complex federal waiver programs run by HHS agencies.",
      "",
      "The American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) held a joint media briefing Wednesday after the hearing, questioning Kennedy's fitness to run the agency, which has 13 separate and important divisions, thousands of programs, and 80,000 employees.",
      "",
      "\"... [H]e demonstrated that he did not have a lot of health experience, and in many of his answers, we saw that he has a ... dearth of management experience,\" said Georges Benjamin, MD, executive director of APHA.",
      "",
      "Benjamin noted that it's important for someone in this position to be \"rigorous about scientific evidence, not cherry pick, and understand things like healthcare financing, which he truly did not know the difference between Medicaid and the health exchanges.\"",
      "",
      "\"He talked about copayments and premiums that were too high for Medicaid when Medicaid doesn't have premiums to start with,\" Benjamin said. Also, \"he made a statement about the fact that NIH (National Institutes of Health) doesn't spend a lot of money on chronic diseases, which is absolutely not true.\"",
      "",
      "Benjamin was asked  --  given the number of Kennedy's misstatements  --  whether he at this point in the process should be better informed about Medicare and Medicaid, and problems with programs for dual eligibles.",
      "",
      "\"He did not understand any of that,\" Benjamin replied. \"And you know, this is not rocket science. ... [HHS] does a lot of things, but I said earlier that the nation spends $5 trillion [on healthcare] and we're at the bottom of the other industrialized nations in terms of health outcomes. There's a lot of reasons for that, but he ain't the guy to fix that because he really doesn't know. He doesn't even understand the basics of what the department does.\"",

That memo directed agency heads to submit no later than February 7 plans that will \"describe the steps the agency will take to revise telework agreements for all eligible employees including major milestones for implementation\" and \"provide timelines for the return of all eligible employees to in-person work as expeditiously as possible.\" Agencies must also explain their plans for getting those who are working remotely full-time back to the office, especially those who live more than 50 miles from their duty stations, and outline any exceptions they intend to grant.",

      "Trump is not alone in his antipathy to teleworking for federal workers. Last December, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) released a report stating that only 6% of federal workers were in the office full-time; the report was titled \"Out of Office: Bureaucrats on the beach and in bubble baths but not in office buildings.\" Ernst's percentage was very much at odds with a 2024 OMB report  --  which has since been removed from the OMB website  --  that found that 54% of federal employees work in the office full-time, while the other 46% of the federal workforce is telework eligible, according to a story on the Meritalk website. Only 10% of federal employees \u2013 228,000 people \u2013 are in fully remote jobs.",
      "",
      "Generally Popular With Both Parties",
      "",
      "Overall, however, telework actually has been popular on both sides of the aisle, Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said last month on a phone call with reporters: \"There has been bipartisan support for telework in the federal space for many, many years, because it's been shown to  --  when well-applied  --  provide both for better performance and improved ability to recruit the best talent for federal positions.\" The Partnership for Public Service says its aim is to build \"a better government and a stronger democracy.\"",
      "",
      "In the past few years, \"there's obviously been a push to try to move people in the federal space back into the office,\" Stier continued. \"The Biden administration actually pushed aggressively to try to make that happen. ... Some organizations like the Patent and Trademark Office have been high performing virtually exclusively. ... We know it's really important to understand that you have those [telework] components that have been working very well, even pre-pandemic, and you wouldn't want to disrupt them, because that would have very negative consequences for the American people.\"",
      "",
      "The in-office order comes as the General Services Administration announced plans to significantly reduce the federal government's real estate footprint. \"One of the things that our government has become is more efficient with respect to cost, in terms of its physical footprint, as a result of increased use of telework and remote work,\" said Stier. \"So those things do run in conflict with each other, and certainly it's so important to understand the transition needs of any organization.\"",
      "",
      "Like everyone else in the federal workforce, HHS's more than 80,000 employees  --  several of whom spoke to MedPage Today on condition of anonymity  --  are trying to figure out how the back-to-work order will be implemented in their specific situation. The agency consists of workers assigned to the HHS headquarters office in Washington as well as 10 regional offices spread throughout the U.S., and lingering logistical questions remain. Some who have previously worked at the Washington headquarters, for example, say there is likely not enough interior space or parking to accommodate all of the employees if everyone now assigned there were to return full-time.",

There may not be enough space for everyone to be in their building, the employee said.",
      "",
      "Still another employee said that their colleagues were \"none too pleased\" to hear about the back-to-office-full-time requirement, noting that the rule appeared to supersede other arrangements in which people could, for instance, work four 10-hour days and get the fifth day off. \"This is an imperious, dictatorial, tin-ear approach to management,\" the person said. \"It's not about efficiency; it's just about vindictiveness. There are ways to achieve the overall goal of serving the American people well, but this is not that.\"",
      "",
      "Changes to Work/Life Balance",
      "",
      "With this change, \"people's work/life balance is about to be completely tipped over,\" the person continued. They noted that \"the flexibility of remote work allowed them to create lives where they were much more productive as parents and still got their work done; if they had to do a carpool at 3 p.m., they could do that and work into the evening. I would get emails from people who were still working at 7 or 8 p.m. But you can't do that if you're in the office 5 days a week with inflexible workplace rules.\"",
      "",
      "Another employee said that telework made it easier to work longer hours when necessary. Before telework, \"it would take me an hour to get into work in the morning and maybe 90 minutes or longer to get home in the afternoon,\" they said, explaining that they worked a 7 a.m.-to-3:30 p.m. shift. But with telework, \"I could work before 7 or after 3:30, and that has happened commonly  --  things come up and require more than just the 8 hours that you do on Monday through Friday.\"",
      "",
      "One thing that might affect whether and when HHS employees return to the office full-time is any collective bargaining agreements that employee unions have with the federal government. \"In the OPM memo, they indicated that there were some issues that need to be resolved through the collective bargaining process before employees that were represented by the unions could actually return to the office,\" the employee added.

Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags.\"",
      "",
      "If confirmed as HHS secretary, would Kennedy have the authority to overhaul the FDA and clear out \"entire departments,\" as he said he planned to do? Lawrence Gostin, JD, a professor at Georgetown Law School in Washington, D.C., said Kennedy has \"extensive power\" to reorganize the federal workforce, but it isn't unlimited.",
      "",
      "He may get some help from Trump, who issued an executive order to reclassify certain federal employee positions in a way that would make it easier to fire them at will, Gostin said. This order seeks to restore a 2020 executive order, which Biden rescinded in January 2021.",
      "",
      "Public servants do have civil service and whistleblower protections, Gostin noted. \"They can complain publicly about malevolent intentions,\" and would likely have a \"valid legal challenge\" if they sued that could at least delay the reclassification process.",
      "",
      "In April, the Office of Personnel Management under President Biden issued a final rule to prohibit this type of reclassification. If the president was to \"follow the letter of the law,\" he would need to revoke the prior rule, which includes issuing a notice, holding a hearing, and having \"good reasons\" for that revocation that could withstand court challenges, Gostin said. \"I think [Trump] may succeed, ultimately, if he perseveres,\" but he also might drop these efforts if enough civil servants retire or quit on their own.",
      "",
      "Steven Balla, PhD, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., told MedPage Today, \"I'm convinced that a lot of this is rhetoric that's designed to demoralize and shrink the federal workforce through 'voluntary' resignations.\"",
      "",
      "Gostin said that the only \"real check\" on Trump's authority relates to centers or divisions having statutory functions  --  meaning their funding or authorities come directly from Congress. In those cases, Trump and Kennedy would need Congress's help to undo or eliminate those functions. \"But if it's simply a matter of reorganizing how an agency is constituted, [Kennedy] has quite extensive power to do that, and that's alarming,\" he added.",

      "Ashish Jha, MD, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island, and former White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator under Biden, agreed with Gostin. \"He can definitely reorganize ... but it's going to be hard to shut entire agencies down,\" he said.",

      "Can Kennedy Pause Research on Infectious Diseases, Direct Half of NIH Funding to Holistic Health?",
      "",
      "At an anti-vaccine conference in 2023, Kennedy, who was still running as an independent candidate for president, said he would tell NIH scientists, \"Thank you for [your] public service. We're going to give infectious disease a break for about 8 years.\" Later, in a September 2024 editorial for the Wall Street Journal, in which he endorsed Trump for president, Kennedy suggested that half of the NIH's budget should be directed to \"preventative, alternative, and holistic approaches to health.\"",
      "",
      "Gostin said, as HHS secretary, Kennedy will have \"certain flexibility\" to allocate where research dollars are spent, but at NIH in particular, Congress funds certain centers and programs. So, \"without congressional action to readjust those financial flows, he's going to have relatively limited ability to make the kind of radical changes that he wants to see,\" he noted.",
      "",
      "Also, given the number of Republicans in Congress with a vested interest in research on childhood cancers, heart disease, diabetes, and even infectious diseases, it would be \"very, very difficult,\" although \"not impossible\" to change that, he added.",

      "Can Kennedy Reverse Vaccine Approvals, Overhaul Vaccine Advisory Committees?",
      "",
      "FDA approvals are granted at the center director level, which is not currently a political appointment, but the HHS secretary does make the final decision, Gostin said.",
      "",
      "Paul Offit, MD, a former member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at CDC and a current member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, noted that if the FDA's vaccine advisory committee recommends a vaccine be licensed and the FDA agrees, the HHS secretary could disagree. \"He can say, 'I think this vaccine hasn't been tested well enough,'\" or even that existing vaccines have not been tested enough.",
      "",
      "Kennedy has previously made such arguments. In 2021, he lobbied the FDA to revoke the authorization of the COVID vaccines, even while thousands of people were dying weekly from the virus. In recent months, however, Kennedy has appeared to moderate his stance, telling Republican senators that he won't take away vaccines and that he just wants to make safety and efficacy data more readily available.",
      "",
      "But Offit noted that Kennedy still believes vaccines cause autism despite \"abundant evidence\" that they do not. \"When he says ... 'I just care about vaccine safety,' what he really means is he wants to see studies done to confirm his immutable, fixed, science-resistant beliefs,\" he said.",
      "",
      "Donald Berwick, MD, president emeritus of the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Boston and a former CMS administrator under President Obama, noted that to change vaccination policies reflected in CDC regulations, an HHS secretary would have to follow the rule-making process and provide a 30- or 60-day comment period under the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "",
      "\"You can always ignore the law, but when you're a public official ... you've taken an oath, and violating that oath has consequences,\" Berwick said, adding that there needs to be enforcement of those consequences.",
      "",
      "Jha noted that as HHS secretary, Kennedy would yield \"soft power\" over the heads of other agencies, including CMS, FDA, NIH, and CDC. \"They're not going to want to make decisions that are going to upset him,\" he said.",
      "",
      "Gostin argued that making vaccine bans the \"holy grail\" of an anti-vaccine agenda is flawed, given the many ways Kennedy, as HHS secretary, could potentially undermine trust in immunizations. Although he has the power to reverse an approval, Kennedy might hesitate to do so given the \"enormous\" backlash he could face, and likely would instead undermine vaccines in other ways  --  such as by appointing vaccine skeptics to advisory committees such as ACIP, he said.",
      "",
      "Balla pointed out that there are stipulations in the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) that govern how these committees are constituted and operate. When there's an opening, usually a call is issued in the Federal Register and an open application process follows. Balla also noted that a share of seats are reserved for certain stakeholders to ensure committees are balanced.",
      "",
      "In the \"bad old days\" before FACA, Balla said, committees would hold non-public meetings and be stacked with certain types of stakeholders. The balance and solicitation requirements seek to prevent that. \"So, that makes it harder to, just by fiat, change the composition of the advisory committee,\" he noted.",
      "",
      "Still, as Gostin pointed out, the CDC director makes nominations for the advisory committees, and appointments are ultimately determined by the HHS secretary. And Kennedy, by leveraging anti-vaccine allies on these committees, could ensure that even approved vaccines would not receive coverage under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "",
      "\"Even more insidiously,\" he added, \"he could cherry-pick data, [and] use misleading health communications to foment doubt and distrust in certain vaccines,\" and \"a number of red states\" would likely change their school immunization requirements as a result.",
      "",
      "Additional Checks and Balances",
      "",
      "Other forces could limit Kennedy's plans, but for Offit, Congress is unlikely to be one of them. \"The mere fact that they might confirm him tells you that you should worry about them ever pushing back\" on his actions, he said.",
      "",
      "Kennedy's confirmation hearing with the Senate Finance Committee is scheduled for Wednesday, and he has a hearing with the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on Thursday.",
      "",
      "For Jha, one check on Kennedy's power is the sheer number of rules that government officials have to follow. \"It's hard to make reform inside government ... You can do window dressing, but substantive reform is very, very hard, and I don't know that [Kennedy has] got the team or the capability or the patience to do it,\" he said. Plus, if he's not careful, lawsuits will inevitably follow, he added.",
      "",
      "\"The truth is that I think the biggest bulwark against really egregious behavior is likely to come from the courts,\" Jha said. \"I think at least for the next 2 years ... if anybody is doing anything, it's going to be the courts.\"",

      "German investigators say a doctor in Berlin who was first arrested in August on suspicion of killing four elderly patients is now suspected of killing a total of 10 patients and, in five cases, trying to cover up the evidence by starting fires",
      "BERLIN -- A doctor in Berlin who was first arrested in August on suspicion of killing four elderly patients is now suspected of killing a total of 10 patients and, in five cases, trying to cover up the evidence by starting fires, investigators said Tuesday.",
      "The unidentified doctor, who was part of a nursing service\u2019s palliative care team, was initially suspected of killing four patients in June and July and then attempting, with mixed success, to set fire to their apartments. In November, investigators said they had found evidence that indicated he killed four more patients, and on Tuesday they said they suspect him of killing a further two patients.",
      "Police and prosecutors said Tuesday that the two additional cases surfaced when they examined patients\u2019 files and carried out forensic examinations, including exhumations.",
      "The two latest cases include the alleged killing of a 25-year-old woman in her apartment in Berlin in Sept. 2021, in which the 40-year-old doctor is suspected of giving the woman a lethal mixture of various drugs with the intention of killing her.",
      "In addition, he is suspected of murdering a 57-year-old woman last June, also in her apartment in Berlin, by administered a lethal mixture of medications, investigators said.",
      "Prosecutors and police said in a joint statement that the accused is said to have had no motive beyond killing, and that the suspect's acts meet the legal definition of \u201clust for murder.\u201d",
      "According to the latest findings, the killings took place between Sept. 2021 and last summer.",
      "On Tuesday, police also called on former colleagues of the suspect or relatives of care recipients who have not had any contact with law enforcement but who may also have suspicions about the death of patients or relatives, urging them to reach out to the police.",
      "The suspect\u2019s name hasn\u2019t been released, in keeping with German privacy rules. Prosecutors say he hasn\u2019t yet responded to the allegations.",

      "BRUSSELS -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will on Wednesday become the first member of the new Trump administration to visit NATO, where the allies are keen to understand how America now plans to influence the course of the war in Ukraine.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s trip comes just ahead of the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin will not stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders if he wins, and that Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.",
      "President Donald Trump has promised to quickly end the war. He\u2019s complained that it is costing the American taxpayer too much money. Some allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that are not favorable to Ukraine.",
      "Hegseth will first take part in a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO\u2019s Brussels headquarters. Former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin set up the main international forum for drumming up arms and ammunition for Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Over the last three years, around 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance. But this week for the first time, the meeting will be convened by another country; the United Kingdom.",
      "No decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is convened.",
      "Hegseth was not expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine. He was not set to meet one on one with his Ukraine counterparts, but rather to be in a \u201clistening mode\u201d at the meeting, as well as at Thursday\u2019s NATO defense ministerial, one U.S. official said.",
      "Asked on Tuesday if the U.S. would send troops to Ukraine to track weapons shipments, Hegseth said the U.S. will not be sending troops into the country.",
      "\u201cThe Secretary will reiterate President Trump\u2019s commitment for a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible. He will also highlight the need for increased European leadership on security assistance to Ukraine,\u201d the Pentagon said, prior to Hegseth\u2019s departure.",
      "America\u2019s 31 NATO allies also want to hear what a new Trump administration has in store for the world\u2019s biggest security organization. Trump traumatized his European partners last time by threatening not to defend any member that doesn\u2019t meet NATO guidelines for military spending.",
      "NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any ally must be considered an attack on them all and met with a collective response. Membership is considered to be the ultimate security guarantee, and it\u2019s one that Ukraine is trying to secure.",
      "A senior NATO diplomat said that \u201cconstructive dialogue with the new American administration would be the most important outcome\u201d of the meeting, along with a U.S. commitment to do everything we can to keep Ukraine in the fight.\u201d",
      "The diplomat spoke to reporters on condition that he not be named, which is common practice among many member countries who make their envoys available to brief media about the latest developments ahead of NATO ministerial meetings and summits.",
      "But Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said over the weekend that \u201cthe Europeans have to own this conflict going forward. President Trump is going to end it. And then in terms of security guarantees, that is squarely going to be with the Europeans.\u2019\u2019",
      "Ukraine\u2019s security needs and defense spending will be discussed on Thursday. European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year the target of spending 2% of GDP.",
      "However, a third still do not, and Trump is almost certain to target them again. Recently, Trump called for NATO members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, a level that no member has reached so far \u2014 not even Poland, which is the closest, spending over 4% and expected to approach 5% this year.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Germany on Tuesday, Hegseth would not commit to having the U.S. increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP. Hegseth said he believes that the U.S. should spend more than it did under the Biden administration and \u201cshould not go lower than 3 percent.\u201d",
      "He said any final decision would be up to Trump, but added that \u201cwe live in fiscally constrained times\u201d and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. The U.S. spends about 3.3% of GDP on defense.",
      "NATO diplomats estimate that members would need to spend 3.5-3.7% of GDP on their military budgets to be able to effectively execute new defense plans that have been drawn up in case of an attack on allied territory.",
      "The organization\u2019s leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague on June 24-26.",

      "Trump this week announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on all foreign steel and aluminum, following his decision last month to impose 10% duties on all Chinese imports, as he accelerates an aggressive push to reset global trade.",
      "Jung said Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs won\u2019t likely have a major impact on South Korea\u2019s economy, as those products account for less than 1% of its exports to the United States. However, Trump says he is also contemplating tariffs on cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.",
      "\u201cSince our semiconductor exports are substantial, the economic impact would be considerable if that sector takes a hit,\u201d Jung said."

Health officials say Haitian women account for up to 70% of births in the country, costing the government millions of dollars.",
      "Ballester said he will deploy additional migration officials across the country to tackle what he described as a surge in undocumented immigrants, saying they\u2019re a burden and a danger to his country.",

      "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.",
      "Trump said that he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It's unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yermak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally doesn't freeze military support. That would be devastating for the country, which has been at war for nearly three years after Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for more than 20 critical raw materials and concluded that if the country joins the 27-nation EU, it could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Trump announced Tuesday that he would send Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to Ukraine to meet with Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cThis War MUST and WILL END SOON \u2014 Too much Death and Destruction. The U.S. has spent BILLIONS of Dollars Globally, with little to show,\u201d Trump said in a post on his social media network about the trip.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It's unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

      "However, Somali pirate attacks have resumed at a greater pace over the last year, in part due to the insecurity caused by Yemen's Houthi rebels launching their attacks in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",

      "Hamas\u2019 threat to delay the next planned release of Israeli hostages from the Gaza Strip has jolted a fragile ceasefire that\u2019s seen as having the potential to wind down the war",
      "JERUSALEM -- Hamas' threat to delay the next planned release of Israeli hostages from the Gaza Strip has jolted a fragile ceasefire that\u2019s seen as having the potential to wind down the war.",
      "It has brought new dismay for Israelis who watched the latest Hamas handover of hostages in growing horror over the weekend as the three emaciated men came into sight. Of the 17 hostages yet to be released from Gaza under this phase of the ceasefire, Israel has said eight are dead.",
      "The next handover of three hostages had been scheduled for Saturday, and families say time is running out for those still alive. Israel now awaits what comes from a security Cabinet meeting Tuesday morning, moved up in response to Monday's Hamas announcement.",
      "The developments also have led to new fear in Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have surged to what remains of their homes in the territory\u2019s north after fleeing in the war\u2019s earliest weeks.",
      "The uncertainty, just over halfway into the ceasefire\u2019s six-week first phase, complicates talks on the far more difficult phase. It also jeopardizes the pause in the devastating fighting and the increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza that it has made possible.",
      "Already, there had been concerns that the war would resume at the end of the first phase in early March.",
      "Hamas accused Israel of not holding up its end of the deal by initially delaying the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza over an earlier dispute, carrying out strikes across the territory and hindering the entry of humanitarian aid.",
      "The militant group, which quickly reasserted control over Gaza when the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, said the next hostage release would be delayed \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz called the delay \u201ca complete violation\u201d of the ceasefire agreement, and he instructed the military to be on highest alert. The prime minister\u2019s coordinator for hostages said the government intends to live up to its end of the deal.",
      "A later Hamas statement called the postponement a \u201cwarning signal\u201d to Israel and noted that five days remained for mediators \u2013 the United States, Qatar and Egypt -- to pressure Israel to act. \u201cThe door remains open for the exchange to proceed as planned if Israel abides by its obligations,\" it said.",
      "There was no immediate public reaction from mediators.",
      "The Hamas announcement came as U.S. President Donald Trump pressed further on his stunning proposal to remove the Palestinian population from devastated Gaza and have the U.S. take \u201cownership\u201d of the territory. He told Fox News on Sunday that the Palestinians would not have the right to return.",
      "That deepened the shock among Palestinians, who live with the history of fleeing or being forced from their homes in what is now Israel during the 1948 war. And it brought new condemnation from Arab nations that have long pressed for an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Trump\u2019s comments contradicted some of his own administration officials who had said the president was only calling for the Palestinians\u2019 temporary relocation.",
      "The Hamas statements on Monday made no mention of Trump\u2019s proposal, which they have rejected multiple times.",
      "In immediate limbo is the planned release on Saturday of three more Israeli hostages, along with dozens more Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody.",
      "Such exchanges \u2013 five so far in a gradual release of 33 hostages \u2013 have been sometimes tense and chaotic acts of trust that have gradually pushed the ceasefire forward, allowing its other measures to fall into place.",

      "Turkey's state-run news agency says police have detained 10 senior officials of district municipalities in Istanbul over their alleged links to Kurdish militants",
      "ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish police on Tuesday detained 10 senior officials of district municipalities in Istanbul over their alleged links to Kurdish militants, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported, widening a crackdown on opposition-held districts in the city.",
      "The detainees include the deputy mayors of the districts of Kartal and Atasehir, along with eight district municipal council members, Anadolu reported. All suspects are members of Turkey\u2019s main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP.",
      "They were detained on suspicion of appointing people with alleged connections to Kurdish militants to municipal positions, thereby allowing the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, to infiltrated the municipalities, Anadolu reported.",
      "Critics view the detentions as part of a government campaign to discredit Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, seen as a potential future challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, along with other opposition figures in the city.",
      "Erdogan\u2019s government rejects allegations that it puts pressure on the courts, insisting the judiciary operates independently.",
      "The CHP made significant gains in Istanbul and across the country in local elections last year, in a major setback to Erdogan\u2019s ruling party.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the CHP\u2019s leadership. Imamoglu blamed the detentions on Erdogan, maintaining in a post on social media platform X that the move was the result of the \u201cwhims of one person who considers himself to be above the will of the people.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu is facing possible jail terms over a series of charges brought against him, including for criticizing legal investigations targeting him and other mayors. In 2022, he was sentenced for insulting public officials after he spoke out against a 2019 decision to annul the initial round of local elections, which he had won. If a higher court upholds his conviction, he could be banned from politics for five years.",
      "Last year, the mayor of Istanbul\u2019s Esenyurt district was arrested over alleged links to the PKK, while the mayor of Besiktas district, was arrested earlier this year over allegations of bid-rigging and bribery. The two have rejected the accusations.",
      "Since the local elections, the government has ousted several elected mayors from the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Equality and Democracy Party for alleged ties to the PKK and replaced them with state appointees. The party denies accusations of links to the banned group.",

    "story": [
      "Iran has lifted import bans on expensive goods like foreign cars and new iPhones, yielding to public demand for the products while also trying to mask the dire straits of its economy",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- All architecture student Amirhossein Azizi wanted for his 19th birthday was the latest iPhone \u2014 and for Iran's cash-strapped theocracy, it was just the gift they needed as well.",
      "Just buying a top-of-the-line iPhone 16 Pro Max in Iran's capital cost him on the day 1.6 billion rials ($1,880). An additional 450 million rials ($530) is required for import fees and registration on government-managed mobile phone networks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very happy to own one of the most expensive phones in the country,\" Azizi said. His father, Mohammad, laughed nearby and added: \u201cMaybe if they had to earn the money themselves, they wouldn\u2019t be so quick to spend it.\u201d",
      "The purchase is only possible after Iran lifted import bans on expensive goods like foreign cars and new iPhones, yielding to public demand for the products while also trying to mask the dire straits of its economy.",
      "While being described as a way to boost Iran's much-vaunted \u201cresistance economy,\" the decisions trapped Iranians into buying more affordable locally produced vehicles long derided as \u201cdeath wagons\u201d and boosted the prices of aging, second-hand iPhones.",
      "They also provide Iran with much-needed tax revenues as its government struggles under international sanctions over its nuclear program. Uncertainty over how U.S. President Donald Trump will deal with Iran also has put pressure on its rial currency, which sits at record lows against the dollar.",
      "Powerful forces within Iran long have been believed to be taking advantage of the sanctions, while those benefiting may just be among the country's most well-off citizens.",
      "\"It\u2019s more about perception than reality,\u201d Iranian economist Saeed Leilaz said.",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, now 85, first proposed the idea nearly 15 years ago as Tehran faced its first round of intense sanctions over its nuclear program, which the West fears puts the Islamic Republic at the precipice of obtaining an atomic bomb. Iran maintains its program is peaceful \u2014 even as it enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels.",
      "\u201cSanctions are not new for us,\" Khamenei said in a 2010 speech. \"All achievements have been made and all the great movements of the people of Iran have been launched while we were under sanctions.\u201d",
      "In some ways, it's worked for Iran's ruling clerics since Trump unilaterally reimposed sanctions on Tehran after withdrawing America from the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran struck deals with China to continuing buying its crude oil, likely at a discount.",
      "Those in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which has grown into a major power center under Khamenei, handle the sales \u2014 both funding their operations against Israel during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and creating a new wealthy elite loyal to Khamenei.",
      "But for the average person, there's clearly a before and an after for the life under the nuclear deal, which saw Iran agree to drastically limit its enrichment and overall stockpile of uranium.",
      "At the time of the deal, the Iranian rial traded at 32,000 to $1. A decade later, $1 is worth 928,500 rials. The public's savings have evaporated, pushing average Iranians into holding onto gold, real estate and other tangible wealth. Others pursue cryptocurrencies or fall to get-rich schemes.",
      "Iran banned the import of foreign cars in 2017, while not allowing iPhones newer than the 13 to be registered on the country\u2019s mobile phone networks. The phone decision set off a scramble for older iPhones, boosting their price, while used car prices for foreign models remain high as well.",
      "In the last Persian year ending in March 2024, Iran imported $3.2 billion worth of mobile phones, customs data shows. The cut for high-end iPhones makes them a lucrative option to plug some of the gaping holes in Iran's government spending \u2014 though Iran's foreign currency reserves remain low due to sanctions.",
      "\u201cLifting restrictions on a few platforms or allowing iPhone imports are the kinds of steps the government can take quickly and with minimal cost to create a sense of progress,\u201d said Leilaz, the economist.",
      "Such decisions also provide a quick win for Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian with Iran's elite \u2014 though it doesn't address any of the longer-term economic problems.",
      "For cars, former President Hassan Rouhani banned imports of fully built foreign vehicles in 2018, after Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the nuclear deal. While in theory protecting Iranian foreign reserves, it also backed up local automobile manufacturers, whose products have long been criticized for not meeting international safety and quality standards \u2014 hence their \u201cdeath wagon\u201d monikers.",
      "Experts believe if Iran's government allowed more lower-priced, higher-quality imports, the country's automobile manufacturers would lose their edge. Restrictions still limit the number of foreign cars that can come into the country and tariffs that Pezeshkian wants lowered may have been again placed at 100%.",
      "\u201cSince the number of newly imported cars is still limited, only a few people can afford them,\" said Saber, a car dealer in Tehran who spoke on condition only his first name be used to be able to discuss the issue frankly. \"As a result, imported cars have skyrocketed in price on the open market.\u201d",
      "As Iran's economy worsens, its theocracy worries conditions could again push the public back onto the streets in nationwide protests. That's why officials up to Khamenei have backed the idea of talking again to the West.",
      "While Trump has suggested he wants talks, he signed an executive order Feb. 4 calling for putting \u201cIran\u2019s export of oil to zero,\u201d including to China, which buys Tehran\u2019s crude at a discount. It also seeks a \u201csnapback\u201d of United Nations sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. If implemented, they could decimate Iran at a time where its people are looking for any sign of optimism.",
      "That includes a car show in Tehran in late January that featured foreign brands like Mazda, Nissan and Toyota, all sought after by Iranians. However, even with the change, Iran's economy still must exist in a world where the U.S. dollar reigns supreme and its rial continues to fall.",
      "\u201cThis biggest problem in this country is that everything depends on the dollar,\" said Saeed Maleki, standing among the vehicles at the show. \"Today they tell you a car costs 3 billion rials. But after a week or a month will they still sell this for 3 billion? No! They will charge me with the new rates.\u201d",

      "LIMA, Peru -- LIMA, Peru (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis on Tuesday accepted the resignation of an influential Peruvian bishop, who has come under criticism for not doing enough to stop abuses committed by a conservative Catholic movement that was recently disbanded by the Vatican.",
      "Peru\u2019s Bishops Conference said Archbishop Miguel Cabrejos from the diocese of Trujillo, will be replaced by the Jesuit bishop Gilberto Vizcarra. A reason for the Pope\u2019s decision was not provided.",
      "Cabrejos, 76, was the president of Peru\u2019s Bishops Conference until January, and had held that position for 12 years.",
      "In a statement published last year, the archbishop said that he had presented his resignation letter to the Vatican in 2023, in accordance with Catholic Church laws that call on bishops to prepare for retirement at age 75.",
      "During the time that Archbishop Cabrejos led the bishop's conference, the Peruvian-based Catholic movement, Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, was accused of sexually abusing its recruits, of threatening journalists and of deploying schemes to strip peasants off their lands in the north of Peru.",
      "Victims of the movement, known also as SCV, have accused Cabrejos of turning a blind eye to these practices.",
      "\u201cHe was indifferent towards victims,\u201d said Pedro Salinas, a journalist and former member of the SCV who published a book about the group\u2019s abuses that unleashed several investigations into the conservative Catholic movement.",
      "SCV, which had been founded in the early 70\u2019s, was disbanded in January by Pope Francis.",
      "In 2017, a report commissioned by the group\u2019s leadership determined that its founder Luis Figari sodomized his recruits and subjected them to humiliating psychological and other sexual abuses.",
      "After an attempt at reform, Francis sent his two most trusted investigators, Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu, to look into the Sodalitium abuses. Their report uncovered \u201csadistic\u201d sect-like abuses of power, authority and spirituality, economic abuses in administering church money and even cases of harassing critics.",
      "The 2023 report by Bertomeu and Scicluna resulted in the expulsions last year of Figari and 10 top members, including an archbishop who had sued Salinas and journalist Paola Ugaz for their reporting and was forced to retire early.",
      "In a recent interview with Peruvian newspaper La Republica, Cabrejos said that Peru\u2019s Bishops Conference had been warning the Vatican of abuses committed by SCV since 2015. The archbishop claimed that the investigators sent to Peru by the Vatican based their findings on information that had already been gathered by Peruvian church leaders for several years.",
      "The SCV was founded in 1971 as one of several Catholic societies born as a conservative reaction to the left-leaning liberation theology movement that swept through Latin America in the 1960s.",

      "BRUSSELS -- U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum \u201cwill not go unanswered,\u201d European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen vowed on Tuesday, adding that they will trigger tough countermeasures from the 27-nation bloc. It means iconic U.S. industries like bourbon, jeans and motorcycles should beware.",
      "\u201cThe EU will act to safeguard its economic interests,\u201d von der Leyen said in a statement in reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum the previous day.",
      "\u201cTariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for business, worse for consumers,\u201d von der Leyen said. \u201cUnjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered \u2014 they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures.\u201d",
      "Just as Trump imposed similar tariffs during his first presidency, the EU countermeasures could easily amount to those that were used to retaliate then if the measures come into force March 12.",
      "Bernd Lange, the chair of the European Parliament's trade committee, warned that previous trade measures were only suspended and could legally be easily revived.",
      "\u201cWhen he starts again now, then we will, of course, immediately reinstate our countermeasures,\u201d Lange told rbb24 German radio.",
      "\u201dMotorcycles, jeans, peanut butter, bourbon, whiskey and a whole range of products that of course also affect American exporters\" would be targeted, he added.",
      "The EU Commission, which negotiates trade relations on behalf of the bloc, said it is not clear what countermeasures would apply, but officials and observers have said they would target Republican states and traditionally strong U.S. exports.",
      "In Germany, which is the EU's largest economy, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told parliament that \u201cif the U.S. leaves us no other choice, then the European Union will react united,\u201d adding: \"Ultimately, trade wars always cost both sides prosperity.\u201d",
      "Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax in the hope that they will give local producers relief from intense global competition, allowing them to charge higher prices.",
      "EU Commission vice-president Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said Tuesday that the tariffs are \"economically counterproductive, especially given the deeply integrated production chains established through our extensive transatlantic trade and investment ties.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will protect our workers, businesses and consumers,\" \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said, but added that \u201cit is not our preferred scenario. We remain committed to constructive dialog. We stand ready for negotiations and to find mutually beneficial solutions where possible.\u201d",
      "The EU estimates that the trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing some 30% of global trade. \u201cThere is a lot at stake for both sides,\u201d he told the EU legislature.",
      "While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.",
      "The EU says that trade in goods reached 851 billion euros ($878 billion) in 2023, with a trade surplus of 156 billion euros ($161 billion) for the EU. Trade in services was worth 688 billion euros ($710 billion) with a trade deficit of 104 billion euros ($107 billion) for the EU.",

      "President Donald Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "President Donald Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax. If that sounds familiar, it\u2019s because he did pretty much the same thing during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s original metals tariffs gave America\u2019s struggling steel and aluminum producers some relief from intense global competition, allowing them to charge higher prices. In anticipation of the new tariffs, shares of steel and aluminum producers climbed Monday. Nucor rose 5.6%, Cleveland-Cliffs jumped 17.9% and Alcoa ticked up 2.2%.",
      "But the tariffs took a toll last time, too, damaging U.S. relations with key allies and driving up costs for \u201cdownstream\u2019\u2019 U.S. producers that buy steel and aluminum and use them to manufacture goods.",
      "Timothy Zimmerman is CEO of one of those downstream companies: Mitchell Metal Products in Merrill, Wisconsin. And he still has bad memories of those times.",
      "\u201cWe were significantly impacted,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe challenges we faced were unprecedented -- rapid inflationary impacts from domestic steel producers. We saw steel prices rise within a few months about 70% over what they had been ... Our (steel) suppliers simply broke contracts and gave us an option: Take this or take nothing.\u2019\u2019",
      "But Mitchell Metal Products was locked into contracts with its own customers \u2014 a wide range of businesses from furniture makers to telecommunications firms -- that didn\u2019t allow it to pass along all or part of the higher cost. His company\u2019s profit margins were squeezed, and it ended up losing business to European rivals that didn\u2019t have to contend with the fallout from Trump\u2019s steel tariffs.",
      "The overall economic impact on the United States was limited then \u2013 and is likely to be limited again -- because steel and aluminum imports amount to barely a ripple in the almost $30 trillion U.S. economy.",
      "Still, the new taxes on foreign steel and aluminum and Trump\u2019s other import tax plans \u2013 including his promise to raise American tariffs to match those charged by other countries -- are likely \u201cto boost U.S. inflation and weigh on global growth this year,\u2019\u2019 Jennifer McKeown and Hamad Hussain of Capital Economics wrote Monday.",
      "The steel and aluminum tariffs would hit U.S. allies. Canada is the No. 1 supplier of foreign steel and aluminum to the United States. Mexico is the No. 3 steel supplier, and Japan and South Korea are also major steel exporters to the U.S.",
      "China is widely seen as source of the world steel industry\u2019s problems. Chinese overproduction has flooded the world with steel and kept prices low, hurting steelmakers in the United States and elsewhere. But the U.S. already uses trade barriers to keep out all but a trickle of Chinese steel. China accounted for less than 2% of U.S. steel imports last year, making it the No. 10 supplier of steel to the U.S., according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group.",
      "In slapping duties on steel and aluminum nearly seven years ago, Trump reached into the federal government\u2019s tariff toolkit and pulled out Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Section 232 gives the president the power to impose tariffs on other countries national security grounds.",
      "The 2018 tariffs \u2014 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum \u2014 provoked outrage in Canada and Mexico, U.S. neighbors and allies that resented being hit with trade sanctions and labeled as threats to U.S. national security.",
      "The steel and aluminum tariffs also drew retaliation as U.S. trading partners hit back with taxes on U.S. exports from Kentucky bourbon to Levi\u2019s jeans.",
      "By making foreign steel costlier, the tariffs allowed U.S. steelmakers to raise prices and encouraged them to keep mills running and to invest in new capacity.",
      "But the tariffs hammered downstream businesses like Zimmerman\u2019s that had to pay the higher prices. In 2021, production at downstream companies dropped by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs, canceling out the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, according to a 2023 study by the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency that investigates trade disputes.",
      "In 2020, researchers from Harvard University and the University of California, Davis, found that the tariffs created 1,000 jobs \u2013 but reduced employment elsewhere by 75,000. When the tariffs hit seven years ago, Mitchell Metal Products employed a peak of 102 workers. It had to cut its payrolls by leaving openings unfilled and weeding out some workers. The company now employs about 75 people.",
      "Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that Trump\u2019s first-term trade wars, including his tariffs on most Chinese imports, were costly to American industry.",
      "\u201cThe net effect of all these tariffs at that time \u2014 on China, aluminum, steel, plus retaliation \u2014 was to reduce U.S. manufacturing unemployment,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI\u2019m expecting the same thing this time around.\u2019\u2019",
      "The 2018 metals tariffs were partially eased. For some countries, they were dropped. For some, they were replaced with import quotas. On Monday, Trump removed all exceptions and exemptions on the original tariffs and upped the levy on aluminum from 10% to 25%.",
      "Zimmerman is bracing for the new tariffs to hit. \u201cAlready last week several large (steel) mills operating in the United States announced price increases in anticipation of the tariffs, not due to increased demand,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI think the domestic producers will work to do the same thing, or very close to the same thing, as what happened in 2018.\u2019\u2019",
      "This time, he said, Mitchell Metal Products will seek to be more pro-active in getting its customers to absorb some of the higher costs. Otherwise, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a healthy place to be as a company.\u2019\u2019",

      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese argued for an exemption during the call, which was scheduled before Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday.",
      "Trump said the United States trade surplus with Australia was one of the reasons he was considering an exemption from the tariffs.",
      "\u201cWe actually have a surplus,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about trade with Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the only countries which we do. And I told (Albanese) that that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll give great consideration to.\u201d",
      "Trump spoke after he removed exceptions and exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel, meaning that all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%. Trump also hiked his 2018 aluminum tariffs to 25% from 10%.",
      "Albanese had told reporters earlier in Canberra he made Australia's case for an exemption, and that both leaders agreed on wording to say publicly, \"which is that the \u2018U.S. president agreed that an exemption was under consideration in the interests of both of our countries.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are the words that are agreed. They\u2019re the words that I\u2019ll stick to. And I can say, though, that it was a very positive and constructive discussion,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "Australia had an exemption from such tariffs during Trump\u2019s first administration.",
      "Australia\u2019s arguments include that the country has run a trade deficit with the U.S. since the mid-20th century and Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S. Australia has only a minor share of the U.S. markets.",
      "Albanese on Tuesday also raised the AUKUS agreement with the U.S. and Britain, struck with former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, in which Australia will acquire a fleet of submarines powered by U.S. nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cOur steel and aluminum are both key inputs for the U.S.-Australia defense industries in both of our countries,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Australia announced over the weekend it had made the first of six $500 million payments to the U.S. under AUKUS to boost U.S. submarine building capacity.",
      "Trump intends to reset U.S. taxes on all imports to match the same levels charged by other countries, all of which comes on top of the 10% tariffs he has already put on China, China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs that started Monday and the U.S. tariffs planned for Canada and Mexico that have been suspended until March 1.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s conversation was Albanese\u2019s second with Trump since the president was elected. Albanese said after the phone call the \u201crelationship is in good shape.\u201d"

      "The Fed cut its main interest rate several times through the end of last year, but traders have been sharply curtailing their expectations for more reductions in 2025, in part because of fears about potentially higher inflation from tariffs. While lower rates can give a boost to the economy and investment prices, they can also give inflation more fuel.",

The plan, requested by a federal judge overseeing the case, does not call for any rate increases to help pay off the company's debt of more than $9 billion and the projected expenses are higher than those in the previous fiscal plan.",
      "The board remains in contentious mediation with creditors as it tries to restructure the only outstanding debt that remains since Puerto Rico declared in 2015 that it could not afford to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load and then filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history two years later.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 19:35:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is proposing an injection of more than $1 billion into road projects to address the state&rsquo;s $30 billion projects backlog",
    "story": [
      "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is proposing an injection of more than $1 billion into road projects to address the state\u2019s $30 billion projects backlog",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Monday proposed an injection of more than $1 billion into road projects in an effort to address the state's $30 billion projects backlog, which will again need more than what gas taxes and other fees can provide.",
      "The Republican governor's budget proposal includes nearly $1 billion in one-time, general state tax money and a plan to shift $80 million annually from the sales tax on tires. It comes two years after Lee and Republican lawmakers approved a similar $3 billion shift of general tax money to roads funding, which is traditionally covered by gas taxes.",
      "The money for roads is one of the big-ticket items in Lee's $59.5 billion budget proposal for the year that begins in July. Tennessee's budget has become tighter because tax revenues have slowed compared with the boom times that took shape during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cSafe, reliable roads are a primary responsibility of the state, yet there are limited funds to fulfill an unlimited need,\u201d Lee said in prepared remarks during his annual State of the State speech Monday evening.",
      "Some parts of the budget were already filled in after a quick special session last month. Lee convinced lawmakers to pass more than $900 million worth of initiatives from different pots of money. They include a huge expansion of vouchers to help students attend private school, coupled with public school teacher raises; relief for areas devastated by Hurricane Helene; and changes to help President Donald Trump's administration with its immigration deportation crackdown plans.",
      "Lee elevated roadwork as a priority in 2023, when his legislation included a $3 billion infusion for projects and a hike in electric vehicle and hybrid fees. It also opened the door for allowing express toll lanes on highways through public-private partnerships, which hasn't been implemented yet as officials initially consider it for a stretch of Interstate 24 from Nashville to the southeastern suburbs.",
      "Tennessee isn't alone. Many states have likewise taken a variety of steps to supplement their gas taxes, which aren't keeping up with their needed roadwork as more people drive electric vehicles and hybrids.",
      "Meanwhile, Lee proposed directing $11 million to the Boys and Girls Club to help boost their childcare programs throughout the state, as well as expand eligibility to a state program that supplements childcare worker salaries.",
      "\u201cToday, infant care in Tennessee carries virtually the same price tag as in-state tuition at a four-year public college,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThat is an insurmountable cost for the vast majority of moms and dads who want to be in the workforce.\u201d",
      "Lee boasted that his proposals would result in \u201ctens of thousands of new daycare spots across rural and urban Tennessee\u201d but did not provide additional details on how or when that goal would be achieved. Nor did he specify who exactly it would serve. For example, many of the Boys and Girls Club locations in Tennessee only offer daycare services to children 5 years old and up.",
      "Also in Monday's speech, Lee proposed a $60 million fund that would create 0% construction loans to build single-family homes. And while the governor's budget does not contain any new tax breaks for Tennesseans, Lee said he plans on funding a tax credit enacted last year that would give incentives to developers building affordable housing.",
      "\u201cThese are important steps, and together, we should continue looking for more solutions that are fiscally responsible to finally address the issue of housing \u2013- through innovation, not through regulation,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee is proposing tens of millions of dollars more to invest in nuclear energy, as well. In his plan, the state would contribute $50 million to help the Tennessee Valley Authority develop a small modular reactor. The federal utility has applied for an $800 million U.S. Department of Energy grant for the initiative."

      "A jury has convened in London for an ancient ceremony to certify that British coins meet the strictest of standards",
      "LONDON -- In a nation where money is counted in pounds and pence, the measure of coins is given great weight \u2014 and a lavish ceremony.",
      "Judges in red robes and white gloves convened Tuesday in the ornate livery hall of London's Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths for an ancient tradition dating back to the 12th century to certify Britain's coinage for circulation.",
      "The test, known as the Trial of the Pyx, was designed to prevent counterfeiting by inspecting and weighing a sampling of thousands of coins from The Royal Mint to ensure they met strict standards.",
      "\u201cIt's a way of making sure that if you\u2019re in the U.K. the coins that are in your pocket are real and reliable, that you know what they\u2019re made of, that they are up to the right standards,\u201d said Eleni Bide, the librarian for the Goldsmiths' Company. \u201cThat provides a challenge for people who want to fake them. So making really standardized perfect coins is a really important part of preventing forgery.\"",
      "The mint submitted nearly 6,500 coins for testing that included future pocket change and limited edition collectibles made of precious metals, including Harry Potter and Star Wars collections. In the past year, the mint has produced coins honoring Beatle Paul McCartney, the late musician George Michael and the writer George Orwell.",
      "It also included a sixpence made from silver recycled from expired medical and industrial X-ray films.",
      "The ceremony gets its name from the ancient Greek word \u201cpyxis,\u201d or small box. Coins are presented in so-called Pyx boxes and jurors randomly select them for testing.",
      "While the judges still used magnifying glasses to inspect the silver and gold pieces, the real testing takes place over months in labs.",
      "The jury will deliver its verdict in May to the nation\u2019s treasury chief, who also serves as master of the mint and is responsible for the quality of the coins.",
      "\u201cHistorically, if they\u2019d been found to have overseen badly produced coins, they would have been financially liable to recompense the Treasury for the money lost because of that,\u201d Bide said. \u201cNowadays, I don\u2019t think that would happen. But if anything did go wrong, if a fault was found, it\u2019s unlikely, but it\u2019s possible that if a fault was found, that would be a big prompt to go and make sure that the processes in the mint were running OK.\u201d"

      "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.",
      "Trump said he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential in many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It is unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yerkmak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally does not freeze military support, which would be devastating for the country that will soon enter its fourth year of war against Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it is in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for over 20 critical raw materials and concluded that the country\u2019s accession to the EU could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It is unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Carlos Slim, Mexico\u2019s richest man and one of the world's wealthiest, addressed a range of topics at his annual conference on Monday. Despite his extensive holdings in sectors ranging from communications and construction to an iconic Mexican restaurant and retail chain, much of the questioning centered \u2014 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2014 on U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Here are some highlights of Slim's address at the headquarters of one of his companies in Mexico City.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to do. He only has four years,\u201d Slim said about Trump's second term.",
      "Slim met Trump during his first term while negotiating the free trade agreement, describing him then as a \u201cnegotiator, not a terminator.\u201d Now, weeks into Trump's second term, Slim only commented that the situation Trump faces is complicated.",

      "\u201cThe United States\u2019 situation isn\u2019t good \u2026 The United States stopped producing things,\u201d Slim said, noting that it outsourced a lot of production abroad simply because it was cheaper.",
      "\u201cThe United States has to see what things it can produce and what it can\u2019t,\u201d he said, citing the semiconductor industry\u2019s resurgence as a prime example of the need for domestic manufacturing.",

      "\u201cYou have to speak with them and remind them that their country is the United States and encourage them to bring their overseas operations home,\" Slim said.",
      "He rejected the idea that the world\u2019s largest fortunes should be taxed, as some propose, because then those fortunes would go elsewhere. \u201cThe trick is that people work,\u201d he said. Creating jobs, not just giving donations.",
      "Slim said he did not meet tech billionaire Elon Musk at Trump's inauguration, but although he agrees with some of his ideas, he would not invest with him because his bets are very risky.",
      "While Slim agrees the U.S. needs to cut wasteful spending, he thinks this is something that should be done with care, not shutting down things in one swipe like \u201cwhen he reduced 80% of Twitter staff.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development is stiffing American businesses on hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills for work that has already been done, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday.",
      "The administration\u2019s abrupt freeze on foreign aid also is forcing mass layoffs by U.S. suppliers and contractors for USAID, including 750 furloughs at one company, Washington-based Chemonics International, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cOne cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct: on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without; on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our constitutional order,\u201d the U.S. businesses and organizations said.",
      "An organization representing 170 small U.S. businesses, major suppliers, an American Jewish group aiding displaced people abroad, the American Bar Association and others joined the court challenge.",
      "It was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington against President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, acting USAID Deputy Administrator Peter Marocco, a Trump appointee who has been a central figure in hollowing out the agency, and Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s head of the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "It is at least the third lawsuit over the administration's rapid unraveling of the U.S. aid and development agency and its programs worldwide. Trump and ally Elon Musk have targeted USAID in particular, saying its work is out of line with Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "Marocco, Musk and Rubio have overseen an across-the-board freeze on foreign assistance and agency shutdown under a Jan. 20 executive order by Trump. A lawsuit brought by federal employees associations has temporarily blocked the administration from pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job. The funding freeze and other measures have persisted, including the agency losing the lease on its Washington headquarters.",
      "The new administration terminated contracts without the required 30-day notice and without back payments for work that was already done, according to a U.S. official, a businessperson with a USAID contract and an email seen by The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal by the Trump administration.",
      "For Chemonics, one of the larger of the USAID partners, that has meant $103 million in unpaid invoices and almost $500 million in USAID-ordered medication, food and other goods now stalled in the supply chain or ports, the lawsuit says.",
      "For the health commodities alone, not delivering them \u201con time could potentially lead to as many as 566,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and unmet reproductive health needs, including 215,000 pediatric deaths,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The filing asserts that the administration has no authority to block programs and funding mandated by Congress without approval.",
      "Marocco defended the funding cutoff and push to put all but a fraction of USAID staff in an affidavit filed late Monday in the lawsuit brought by the workers\u2019 groups.",
      "\u201cInsubordination\u201d and \u201cnoncompliance\u201d by USAID staffers made it necessary to stop funding and operations by the agency to allow the administration to carry out a program-by-program review to decide what U.S. aid programs could resume overseas, Marocco wrote."

    "story": [
      "Like a watered-down drink, domestic sales for American whiskeys were unsatisfying in 2024 as inflation reined in consumer spending on some distilled spirits",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Like a watered-down drink, domestic sales for American whiskeys were unsatisfying in 2024, as inflation reined in consumer spending on some distilled spirits. But it's tariffs that loom as one of the stiffest challenges ahead, threatening to deplete sales in key foreign markets, an industry group said Tuesday.",
      "Brewing trade conflicts with Canada and Mexico risk driving up the price of U.S. spirits in those markets. The biggest risk is in the European Union, where tariffs are set to resume April 1 at double the rate on American whiskey producers, who again find themselves ensnared in a trade dispute over steel and aluminum. The new tariff would undo the strong rebound in American whiskey sales in Europe since a 25% EU tariff was suspended a few years ago, the Distilled Spirits Council said.",
      "\u201cThe reimposition of these tariffs at a 50% rate would gut this growth and do irreparable harm to distillers large and small,\u201d Chris Swonger, the council's CEO, said of the EU. \"It would be a catastrophic blow that will force many distillers out of our largest export market.\u201d",
      "Talk of tariffs cast a shadow over the council's report on 2024 U.S. spirits sales, which revealed a drop in domestic sales for the American whiskey category, which includes bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey. The council didn't break out sales for each type of whiskey.",
      "As President Donald Trump pushes to reset global trade, U.S. spirits can be a high-profile target for retaliation. During trade conflicts in Trump's first term, American whiskey exports to the EU plunged by 20%, the council said. Once the tariff was suspended, those exports surged by 60%, it said.",
      "Canada, another key export market for American spirits, initially ordered tariffs on American imports, including beverages, until a reprieve was announced last week. Before the pause, authorities in several provinces said they planned to remove American liquor brands from government store shelves.",
      "Trump has alternately said he sees import taxes as tool to force concessions on issues such as immigration, but also as a source of revenue to help close the government\u2019s budget deficit.",
      "But anxiety is now high among whiskey producers and their supporters, many of them in states that voted overwhelmingly to return Trump to the White House. That includes Kentucky, where 95% of the world's bourbon supply is crafted and where a record 14.3 million barrels of bourbon were aging at the start of 2024, according to the Kentucky Distillers\u2019 Association.",
      "The renewed tariff threats arrive with Boundary Oak Distillery in central Kentucky trying to establish a foothold in the EU to augment its domestic sales in 12 to 15 U.S. states.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying very hard to make a presence,\" Brent Goodin, the distillery\u2019s owner, said by phone this week. \"Craft products, especially craft bourbons, are appreciated all over the world.\u201d",
      "His family-owned craft distillery shipped about 200 cases of its bourbon and lavender whiskey to Lithuania last fall, he said. He's preparing to send another shipment soon, having spread distribution to Poland and with hopes of cracking what he sees as a potentially big market in Hungary, he said.",
      "It all could come crashing down if his products get hit with a 50% tax.",
      "\u201cThat would wipe out the market,\" Goodin said. \"That would pretty much kill it.\u201d",
      "Spirit exports come from 45 states, and American whiskeys account for 63% of all U.S. spirits exports, the council said. The spirits industry is hoping cooler heads prevail to produce trade deals that keep their products from getting entangled again in back-and-forth tariffs.",
      "It comes as spirits producers encounter headwinds at home in the U.S.",
      "Overall, the spirits industry maintained its advantage in U.S. market share but its revenues slipped in 2024, the council said. Spirits supplier sales in the U.S. fell 1.1% to total $37.2 billion, while volumes rose 1.1% to 312.2 million 9-liter cases, it said.",
      "Revenue and volumes for super premium spirits, which fetch the highest prices, fell last year as inflation-weary buyers picked slightly less-expensive options. The combination of high inflation and interest rates forced many to \"reduce spending on little luxuries like distilled spirits,\u201d Swonger said.",
      "The industrywide results reflect a return to more normal domestic levels following sales spikes during the COVID-19 pandemic, Swonger said. Another challenge is that younger adults appear to be imbibing less.",
      "Domestic sales of American whiskeys fell 1.8% in 2024 to total $5.2 billion in revenue, the council said.",
      "Vodka sales were flat, totaling $7.2 billion, while tequila and mezcal sales rose 2.9% to total $6.7 billion last year, the council said. Sales of premixed cocktails, including ready-to-drink spirits products, surged 16.5% to $3.3 billion, it said."

      "The Trump administration has ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop nearly all its work, effectively shutting down the agency that was created to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop nearly all its work, effectively shutting down an agency that was created to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal.",
      "Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, directed the CFPB, in a Saturday night email confirmed by The Associated Press, to stop work on proposed rules, to suspend the effective dates on any rules that were finalized but not yet effective, and to stop investigative work and not begin any new investigations. The agency has been a target of conservatives since President Barack Obama pushed to include it in the 2010 financial reform legislation that followed the 2007-2008 financial crisis.",
      "The email also ordered the bureau to \u201ccease all supervision and examination activity.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, administration officials also said that the CFPB's headquarters in Washington, D.C. would be closed the week of Feb. 10 through Feb. 14, according to an email obtained by The Associated Press. No reason was given for closure.",
      "\u201cEmployees and contractors are to work remotely unless instructed otherwise,\u201d the email to headquarters workers said.",
      "The order follows similar efforts by the White House to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Since the CFPB is a creation of Congress, it would require a separate act of Congress to formally eliminate it. But the head of the agency has discretion over what enforcement actions to take, if any.",
      "Yet Elon Musk commented, \u201cCFPB RIP\u201d on social media site X on Friday. And the CFPB homepage on the Internet was down Sunday, replaced by a message reading \u201cpage not found.\u201d",
      "Also late Saturday, Vought said in a social media post that the CFPB would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve, adding that its current reserves of $711.6 million is \u201cexcessive.\" Congress directed the bureau to be funded by the Fed to insulate it from political pressures.",
      "\u201cThis spigot, long contributing to CFPB\u2019s unaccountability, is now being turned off,\u201d Vought said on X.",
      "The CFPB says that it has obtained nearly $20 billion in financial relief for U.S. consumers since its founding in the form of canceled debts, compensation, and reduced loans. Last month, the bureau sued Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts \u2014 and \u201ccheating\u201d customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result, the bureau said.",
      "Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, an advocacy group, said, \u201cthat's why Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks and Trump\u2019s billionaire allies hate the bureau: it\u2019s an effective cop on the finance beat and has stood side-by-side with hundreds of millions of Americans \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 battling financial predators, scammers, and crooks.\u201d",
      "The administration's move against the CFPB also highlights the tensions between Trump's more populist promises to lower costs for working-class families and his pledge to reduce government regulation.",
      "During the campaign, Trump said he would cap credit card interest rates at 10%, after they had soared to record levels above 20%, on average, as the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates in 2022 and 2023. The CFPB had started work on how that proposal would be implemented.",
      "The bureau can still take complaints, but it can\u2019t conduct exams or pursue existing investigations, according to a person familiar with the agency who insisted on anonymity to discuss CFPB business. The memo is also interpreted as blocking it from communicating with companies it regulates, consumer advocates or other outside groups.",
      "Musk\u2019s team would also have access to complaints, investigations and regulatory oversight data. The access raises uncomfortable questions if Musk\u2019s company X launches a payments system as the CFPB has data on competitors such as Cash App, the person said.",
      "Vought's email follows a similar directive from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Feb. 3 and is the latest move by the Trump administration to rapidly curtail the work of federal agencies that they have deemed excessive.",
      "Obama spearheaded the creation of the bureau in the wake of the 2007-2008 housing bubble and financial crisis, which was caused in part by fraudulent mortgage lending. It was the brainchild of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and has attracted lawsuits from large banks and financial industry trade associations.",
      "\u201cVought is giving big banks and giant corporations the green light to scam families,\" Warren said.",
      "Last week, Warren called on Trump to work with the bureau to protect Americans from de-banking, the practice of banks shutting down customer accounts because they believe they pose financial, legal or reputational risks to the banks.",
      "\u201cI know that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a favorite whipping boy of Republicans on this Committee, but the CFPB is the main agency in our government that is actively working to stop unfair de-banking,\u201d she said at a hearing of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.",
      "Vought's email said that President Donald Trump had made him acting director of the CFPB on Friday. Trump fired the previous director of the bureau, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1. Vought was an architect of Project 2025, a policy blueprint for the Trump White House that Trump tried to disavow during last year's campaign.",
      "Under Chopra, the CFPB approved rules to cap overdraft fees by banks, limit junk fees, and has proposed restrictions on data brokers selling personal information such as Social Security numbers.",

      "The midair collision that killed 67 near Washington, the fiery plane crash in Philadelphia and now a missing plane in Alaska are only the most high-profile disasters. There was also a Japan Airlines plane that clipped a parked Delta plane while it was taxiing at the Seattle airport earlier this week and a United Airlines plane caught fire during takeoff at the Houston airport Sunday after an engine problem sparked a fire on the wing.",
      "That's not even to mention the security concerns that arose after stowaways were found dead inside the wheel wells of two planes and aboard two other flights. And don't forget about the time that a passenger opened an emergency exit door on a plane while it was taxiing for takeoff in Boston.",
      "So of course people are wondering whether their flight is safe?",
      "The Jan. 29 collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter killed everyone aboard both aircraft. It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground. There hadn't even been a deadly crash of any kind involving a U.S. airliner since February 2009.",
      "Crashes are more common involving smaller planes like the single-engine Cessna that crashed in Alaska on Thursday. Ten people including the pilot were killed.",
      "A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people onboard and another person on the ground. That Learjet generated a massive fireball when it smashed into the ground in a neighborhood not long after taking off from a small airport nearby.",
      "Fatal crashes attract extraordinary attention partly because they are rare. The track record of U.S. airlines is remarkably safe, as demonstrated by the long stretch between fatal crashes.",
      "But deadly crashes have happened more recently elsewhere around the world, including one in South Korea that killed all 179 people aboard in December. There were also two fatal crashes involving Boeing\u2019s troubled 737 Max jetliner in 2018 and 2019. And last January, a door plug blew off a 737 Max while it was in flight, raising more questions about the plane.",
      "And federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.",
      "President Donald Trump added to those concerns Thursday when he blamed the midair collision on the \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system that airports rely on and promised to replace it.",
      "But even with all that, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy went on Fox News earlier this week and tried to assure viewers that air travel is \"way safer than traveling in a car and train. This is the safest mode of transportation.\u201d",
      "And the statistics back that up.",
      "The National Safety Council estimates that Americans have a 1-in-93 chance of dying in a motor vehicle crash, while deaths on airplanes are too rare to calculate the odds. Figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation tell a similar story.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration are investigating these recent crashes and close calls to determine what caused them and look for ways to prevent similar incidents.",
      "There have already been troubling revelations about the midair collision, but it will take more than a year to get the full report on what happened.",
      "The NTSB always recommends steps that could be taken to prevent crashes from happening again, but the agency has a long list of hundreds of previous recommendations that have been ignored by other government agencies and the industries it investigates.",
      "But Duffy said the public is right to say that crashes like the recent ones are unacceptable. That is why he plans to make sure \u201csafety is paramount\u201d as he leads the agency that regulates all modes of transportation.",
      "\u201cI feel really good about where we\u2019re at and where we\u2019re going and the plans we have in place to make sure we even make the system safer and more efficient than it is today,\u201d Duffy said in the Fox interview."

      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly challenged Senate Republicans with his Cabinet picks",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has repeatedly challenged Senate Republicans with his Cabinet picks. But his nomination of Lori Chavez-DeRemer for labor secretary may be proving the hardest for many to accept.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer, a former congresswoman from Oregon, hardly cuts the profile of a traditional Republican nominee. She is the daughter of a lifelong Teamsters member. She's a small business owner who served as the mayor of a fast-growing suburb in liberal Portland, Oregon. And in the House, she co-sponsored legislation championed by America\u2019s labor unions.",
      "That background is why Trump, encouraged by some allies, nominated Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Labor Department. Her selection has scrambled the usual partisan divides, attracting some Democratic support even as her union-friendly stances generate concern and in some cases outright opposition from many Republicans.",
      "But that shakeup is exactly the goal for Trump and allied Republicans, who aim to cast aside the party\u2019s long-held antipathy toward unions and lure more voters away from the Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cThe party has changed,\u201d said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a proponent of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees who says he speaks with Chavez-DeRemer on a regular basis.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the new coalition of supporters that President Trump brought to the party, labor being one of them ... Lori\u2019s a perfect person to kind of fit that gap,\u201d he said.",
      "But that view is far from unanimous across the GOP, with some Senate Republicans outright opposed to her confirmation.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who sits on the Senate committee overseeing labor issues, criticized Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s past support for the PRO Act, saying the law would overturn state laws that require an employee be able to refrain from joining a labor union.",
      "Yet Paul said he believes Chavez-DeRemer will likely be confirmed on an unusually bipartisan basis.",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019ll lose 15 Republicans and she\u2019ll get 25 Democrats,\u201d Paul told reporters. \u201cBut she\u2019s very pro-labor. She might get all the Democrats, who knows.\u201d",
      "If confirmed, Chavez-DeRemer will confront growing challenges in the workplace at a time of resurgent union organizing. The Labor Department\u2019s reach is vast, covering investigations into labor practices, debates over in-office and remote work and concerns over automation as artificial intelligence products surge across the economy.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer, like other Trump Cabinet nominees, has kept quiet ahead of her confirmation hearing, which is set for Wednesday. But in the past, she\u2019s been blunt about her backing of organized labor. As a House member, she often welcomed union members into her office for meetings, and she touted her support from her district\u2019s union chapters on the campaign trail.",
      "\u201cIn my district, unions aren't the enemy of small businesses, they're a partner. Small businesses benefit from the presence of unions. As a small business owner, I know this better than most,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said in a 2024 reelection ad.",
      "When she sat on the House subcommittee that oversees labor issues, Chavez-DeRemer was often absent from hearings that her Republican colleagues held to lambast unions.",
      "\u201cWhen I was asked to be on that committee, I let them know ahead of time that I would be somewhat challenging maybe some of the views and they are OK with that,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said during a 2023 interview with the union-run Northwest Labor Press.",
      "Union leaders took notice.",
      "Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest labor unions in the country, is supporting Chavez-DeRemer and said she hopes Trump \u201cgives her the power that President Roosevelt gave Francis Perkins,\u201d the trailblazing labor secretary who oversaw the New Deal.",
      "\u201cYou already see the anti-labor people in the Republican Party trying to mount a case against her,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cI thought it was important for those of us who believe in labor rights and worker empowerment to stand up and say that that this was unconventional and a positive appointment.\u201d",
      "Chavez-Demer\u2019s nomination also has the support of Sean O'Brien, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. He made waves ahead of last year\u2019s election by speaking at the Republican convention before the Teamsters declined to endorse Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris for president.",
      "O'Brien approached Mullin after the election and floated Chavez-DeRemer's name, arguing she could be an olive branch to organized labor, Mullin recalled. They then went together and pitched Trump on the idea.",
      "The team-up would have been unimaginable in 2023, when O\u2019Brien lambasted Mullin as a \u201cgreedy CEO who pretends like he\u2019s self-made\u201d at a hearing that nearly devolved into a fistfight. But in the interceding years, they\u2019d developed a friendship over sports, fitness and the politics of work.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a bit of an odd couple, I guess,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "Trump's outreach to voters from once heavily unionized communities has been a driving force behind the new union-friendly approach. Others in the party have been working toward the same goal. Conservative academics and policy aides have been organizing behind the scenes for years as part of an effort to shift the GOP's thinking on economics.",
      "\u201cAt a high level, the change has been a shift from defaulting to a pro-business perspective,\u201d said Abigail Ball, the executive director at American Compass, a conservative think tank. Ball said the \u201cfailure of globalization\u201d has pushed many conservatives toward a new approach.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:06:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The odds of further interest rate cuts this year by the Federal Reserve dwindled last week as unemployment fell and more officials say they want to see how new policies from the White House affect the economy",
    "story": [
      "The odds of further interest rate cuts this year by the Federal Reserve dwindled last week as unemployment fell and more officials say they want to see how new policies from the White House affect the economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- The odds of further interest rate cuts this year by the Federal Reserve dwindled last week as unemployment fell and more officials say they want to see how new policies from the White House affect the economy.",
      "While Fed officials penciled in two rate cuts this year at their December meeting, economists and Wall Street investors are increasingly skeptical, with some predicting no reductions at all this year. On Friday, economists at Morgan Stanley said they now expect just one rate cut in 2025, and investors also expect just one \u2014 in July \u2014 according to pricing in futures markets.",
      "Fewer cuts could translate into a longer period of elevated mortgage rates high costs to borrow money for everything from autos to credit cards. Still, mortgage rates are closely tied to the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can move independently of the Fed's actions.",
      "The shifting expectations come as Chair Jerome Powell heads to Capitol Hill for two days of testimony this week, beginning Tuesday, before House and Senate committees that oversee the central bank and the financial industry. Fed chairs are required by law to appear before Congress twice a year.",
      "Members of Congress may urge that he cut rates more quickly. He will also likely be grilled about issues that are taking a higher profile under the Trump administration, such as crypto regulation, banking regulation, and allegations of \u201cde-banking.\u201d",
      "De-banking is the practice of banks shutting down customer accounts because they believe they pose financial, legal or reputational risks to the banks. Some crypto executives have charged that Biden administration regulators pressured financial firms to target their industry for de-banking.",
      "Regarding interest rates, Fed officials have suggested recently that after cutting their key rate three times at the end of last year \u2014 to about 4.3%, down from two-decade high of 5.3% \u2014 they are likely to be on hold for an extended period, though none will specify how long that might be.",
      "On Friday, Fed governor Adriana Kugler said that the labor market was \u201cstable\u201d and that \u201cgives us a little bit of time to make some decisions.\u201d She noted that inflation has \"moved sideways\" since the fall and is above their 2% target.",
      "She added that potential policy changes from the Trump administration have added uncertainty to their outlook for the economy. Economists have said that widespread tariffs, and the deportation of immigrants that Trump has also promised, could push up inflation. Others argue that Trump's deregulatory policies could, by increasing supply, reduce prices.",
      "\u201cThe cautious and the prudent step is to hold the (Fed's key) rate where it is for some time,\u201d Kugler said. \"Given that the economy is solid, given the fact that we haven\u2019t achieved our 2% target, and given the fact that we may have uncertainties and other factors that may be pushing up inflation.\u201d",
      "Separately, Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press Friday that he still expects the central bank's rate will be lower in the next 12 to 18 months than it is now. But he also said it makes sense for the Fed to take a slower approach as it nears a point where it may stop reducing rates.",
      "He also noted that the prospect of tariffs has muddied the waters a bit for the Fed in the coming months. Tariffs may cause a one-time increase in prices but don't necessarily cause ongoing inflation.",
      "As a result, Goolsbee said, Fed officials will have to sort through any price increases that do occur to determine whether they are one-time changes, or a reflection of persistent inflationary pressures.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not that easy to do, it\u2019s going to take time to figure that out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still just got to wait for the dust to clear.\u201d",
      "Other officials also suggested that it will take time for the Fed to determine what steps it needs to take next.",
      "Lorie Logan, president of the Fed's Dallas branch, said Thursday that while in \u201csome scenarios\u201d the Fed may soon cut rates, it's also possible \u201cwe'll need to hold rates at least at the current level for quite some time.\u201d",
      "Even if inflation were to fall close to the 2% target, she added, that wouldn't necessarily mean the Fed should \u201ccut rates soon.\" Instead, with the economy mostly healthy and hiring holding up, the Fed's key rate may already be close to the level at which it doesn't restrict or stimulate growth, she said \u2014 a level that economists refer to as the \u201cneutral rate.\u201d",
      "The government said Friday that employers added a solid number of jobs last month while the unemployment rate ticked down for the second straight month to 4%, historically quite low. Hiring in November and December was revised much higher.",
      "Steady hiring and a mostly-healthy job market suggest that there is less of an urgent need for the Fed to reduce borrowing rates. It implemented a steep half-point cut in September after weak hiring over the summer spurred fears that the economy was stumbling, possibly into recession.",
      "The jobs report \u201cbolsters our confidence that the Fed cutting cycle is over,\u201d economists at Bank of America wrote in a note Friday."

      "\u201cFor far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!\u201d Trump wrote in a post Sunday night on his Truth Social site. \u201cI have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\u201d",
      "The move by Trump is the latest in what has been a rapid-fire effort by his new administration to enact sweeping change through executive order and proclamation on issues ranging from immigration, to gender and diversity, to the name of the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "Trump had not discussed his desire to eliminate the penny during his campaign. But Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency raised the prospect in a post on X last month highlighting the penny\u2019s cost.",
      "The U.S. Mint reported losing $85.3 million in the 2024 fiscal year that ended in September on the nearly 3.2 billion pennies it produced. Every penny cost nearly $0.037 \u2014 up from $0.031 the year before.",
      "The mint also loses money on the nickel, with each of the $0.05 coins costing nearly $0.14 to make.",
      "It is unclear whether Trump has the power to unilaterally eliminate the lowly one-cent coin. Currency specifications -- including the size and metal content of coins -- are dictated by Congress.",
      "But Robert K. Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University, has argued that there might be wiggle room.",
      "\u201cThe process of discontinuing the penny in the U.S. is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,\u201d he said last month.",
      "Members of Congress have repeatedly introduced legislation taking aim at the zinc coin with copper plating. Proposals over the years have attempted to temporarily suspend the penny\u2019s production, eliminate it from circulation, or require that prices be rounded to the nearest five cents, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Proponents of eliminating the coin have cited cost savings, speedier checkouts at cash registers, and the fact that a number of countries have already eliminated their one-cent coins. Canada, for instance, stopped minting its penny in 2012.",
      "It wouldn't be the first time the U.S. eliminated its least valuable coin. The half-cent coin was discontinued by Congress in 1857.",
      "Trump's new administration has been sharply focused on cutting costs, with Musk, who has been brought on to lead the task, targeting entire agencies and large swaths of the federal workforce as he tries to identify a goal of $2 trillion in savings.",

    "story": [
      "A growing number of people and groups in the international development ecosystem have stepped forward to track the widespread impacts of the freeze on U.S. foreign aid",
      "When U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department told their contractors to pause all work, Sadie Healy expected the impact to be \u201chorrendous.\u201d",
      "But Healy, who runs a small global health consulting firm, Molloy Consultants, realized no one was documenting how bad the freeze on U.S. foreign aid would be. USAID wouldn\u2019t be cataloging the impacts as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration fired senior staff, shuttered its headquarters and then told its employees their jobs would end. The nonprofits and aid companies who worked with USAID were fighting to survive.",
      "So Healy decided she would do it.",
      "\u201cI am an action person. The depression and the sadness that we knew this was going to cause was something I couldn\u2019t deal with,\u201d Healy said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cSo we called a Zoom meeting.\u201d",
      "Healy is one of a growing number of people and organizations in the international development ecosystem stepping forward to track the impact of the freeze on U.S. foreign aid. Many are nonprofits who already support grassroots groups around the world, while others are professionals now volunteering their time, connections and skills.",
      "The U.S. is the largest single global humanitarian funder, giving $13.9 billion in 2024, and largest supporter of U.N. agencies, meaning any changes to foreign assistance have sweeping impacts across geographies and issues. The pause in funding has since turned into the dismantling of USAID and its programs.",
      "\u201cCLOSE IT DOWN,\u201d Trump said on social media on Friday, though a judge has paused a plan to put thousands of employees on paid leave.",
      "Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and billionaire adviser to the Trump administration, has led the campaign to shut down USAID, saying in posts on X that it is \u201cevil,\u201d a \u201ccriminal organization,\u201d and a \u201cviper\u2019s nest of radical-left marxists who hate America.\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said funding will not be permanently cut, but people in the field say every day the freeze continues and USAID stops works causes irreparable harm. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Healy and her business partner Meg McClure said they decided to focus on documenting the number of American jobs lost. They eventually got in touch with a staffer from a Senate committee, who advised them on what data to collect.",
      "Within days, they launched a website, USAID Stop-Work, and a survey to document how many U.S. jobs have been lost as a result of the freeze on foreign assistance. So far, employers or employees have reported 10,758 jobs cut since the stop work orders landed on Jan. 24. That number includes some positions at USAID, but not all of the 8,000 workers directly employed by the agency and the thousands more in the field.",
      "\u201cWe can document the destruction that this executive order has caused,\u201d Healy said. \u201cAnd we hope that lawyers and we hope that members of Congress can use that for their case.\u201d",
      "At least two groups with tech capacity and deep networks circulated online surveys to learn about the extent of the funding cuts. They eventually merged efforts and set up the website, Global Aid Freeze to visualize the initial responses. The nonprofit GlobalGiving launched a fund to support small international organizations, many of whom will not survive even a 90-day pause in U.S. foreign funding.",
      "Roth Smith, an assistant professor in the School of Communication Studies at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, studies how people organize outside of formal structures, often in response to a disaster. He said volunteer efforts to map a crisis and connect that information to people who can act is typical, but the reach of this organizing is impressive.",
      "\u201cThis is a much larger scale and it seems to be highly polished,\" he said.",
      "The international nonprofit Accountability Lab, which now operates the Global Aid Freeze website, said 568 organizations responded to its survey about the impacts of the U.S. government's foreign aid freeze. Half of the respondents estimated they had less than 3 months of operating reserves, meaning they will shutdown by May if funding remains on hold.",
      "Blair Glencorse, founder and co-CEO of Accountability Lab, said they've been in touch with foundations to try to help them figure out where their support can be most strategic. He said it also seems hard for nonprofits in developing countries to understand how dramatic and lasting the changes in U.S. foreign funding may be.",
      "\u201cThings are fundamentally changed and I don\u2019t think the aid system is going to be the same again,\u201d he said.",
      "Other grassroots efforts have focused on supporting those who lost their jobs. Joanne Sonenshine, an economist who has worked as a consultant alongside USAID for more than a decade, said she saw a flood of LinkedIn posts about layoffs and in response, a flurry of job announcements. So, she set up a spreadsheet where people could put in their experience and contact information and others could post links to open positions. Almost 800 people wrote in their names, locations and work history. Another spreadsheet included more than 550 entries.",
      "\"This just goes to show how much we need support for these people. And this is not just D.C. people, by the way,\u201d Sonenshine said. \u201cThese are U.S. contractors or U.S. staff all over the world whose livelihoods and their family\u2019s life depended on the U.S. government.\u201d",
      "These grassroots tracking efforts are largely self-funded and self-directed. Healy and McClure pay for the website tracking U.S. job losses themselves. Accountability Lab stood up their survey without any dedicated funding, though they've recently gotten some support to continue the effort.",
      "Other professionals within international development have also offered to work for free to help people find jobs or help organizations get new funding. Healy said that willingness reflects the broader ethos and resilience of the community.",
      "\u201cWe love planning, it\u2019s our favorite thing,\u201d Healy said. \u201cWe are like, \u2018This is the moment we were made for. Let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201d",

Four old ladies went on a joy ride in a commercial for WeatherTech, while sloths had a case of the Mondays in an ad for Coors Light. And British singer Seal became an actual seal, sad that he couldn't hold Mountain Dew with his flippers.",

      "Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, said this was a complicated Super Bowl for advertisers.",
      "Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, Calkins said. The finalized crop of commercials feature a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,\u201d Calkins said. \u201cSafe advertising isn\u2019t the advertising you notice or remember.\u201d",

Disney asked what the world would be like without the iconic characters it owns, like Elsa from \u201cFrozen,\u201d Bart Simpson and the Marvel superheroes.",
      "Advertisers are leaning on nostalgia more than they used to in Super Bowl ads, according to Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business. Nods to the past can broaden the appeal of an ad to different generations and connect products to positive cultural moments, she said.",
      "Putting celebrities together in unexpected combinations can broaden the appeal of a commercial. In their Super Bowl ad for Michelob Ultra, actors Catherine O'Hara and Willem Dafoe are pickleball champs. Soccer star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon are long-lost twins who bond over Stella Artois. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete Davidson teamed up for a HexClad commercial, while Post Malone, Shane Gillis and Peyton Manning had a block party with Bud Light. A slew of celebrities, including Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig and Charlie XCX, appeared in an ad for Uber Eats.",
      "Linli Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Carlson School of Management, said celebrity endorsements can get people talking. But with dozens of brands using them, there's a risk of diminishing returns.",

      "\u201cThere is a balancing act in terms of having celebrities in the ads,\u201d she said.",
      "Multiple ads put a spotlight on women and girls. Pharmaceutical company Novartis promoted early detection for breast cancer, while Lay's had a heart-warming spot featuring a little girl who grows her own potato.",
      "Women's sports were also a big focus. Nike featured Caitlin Clark, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, Sabrina Ionescu, Jordan Chiles, A\u2019ja Wilson and Sophia Wilson in a commercial talking about how often female athletes face the word, \u201ccan't.\" The ad's conclusion: \u201cYou can\u2019t win. So win.\"",
      "The NFL ran a commercial calling for girls' flag football to become a varsity sport in all 50 states. But Dove also offered a sobering statistic: half of girls who quit sports have been criticized for their body type.",

The Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, ran an ad featuring Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady saying what they hate about each other, in an effort to show how pointless hate is.",
      "An ad from Rocket showed people dreaming of home and aimed to get the Super Bowl crowd to sing along to \u201cTake Me Home, Country Roads.\u201d Xu said she expected more ads promoting that unifying message, but thought most advertisers went with humor instead.",

Come Near, a nonprofit that says it aims to share \u201cthe love and message of Jesus in disruptive and personally engaging ways,\" funded the ad this year and last year after taking over the effort from a previous group.",
      "Several Super Bowl ads made the case for AI as a helpmate. Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner teamed up for an ad wearing Meta 's smart glasses, which use artificial intelligence to answer questions about what wearers are seeing. Actor Walton Goggins pitched GoDaddy Airo, which uses AI to help build websites and social content. And Google's \u201c50 States, 50 Stories\u201d campaign is showing viewers a small business from their state that's using Google's Gemini AI assistant.

      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- A controversial new NASCAR rule designed for \u201cworld-class drivers\" could give Helio Castroneves an automatic berth into the Daytona 500, and, should the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner use the provisional, it would make for the largest field in a decade.",
      "It's a complicated rule that was written into the charter agreement that 13 teams signed last September and is similar to a \u201cpromoters provisional\u201d in that it gives NASCAR the ability to designate one driver as a guaranteed 41st entry.",
      "Three-time Daytona 500 Denny Hamlin said the rule \u201creeks of desperation\u201d by NASCAR, calling it nothing but a gimmick to attract big stars to stock car racing. Others wondered why the provisional went to Castroneves, who at 49 will be making his NASCAR debut, instead of seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, a two-time Daytona 500 winner.",
      "The rule is designed for drivers who don't currently race full time in NASCAR, so Johnson and 2017 Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. would have been eligible for consideration for the provisional.",
      "But their teams never put in the request, which must be done 90 days before the event. Only Trackhouse Racing requested the provisional for Castroneves, who enters Wednesday's qualifying as the only driver eligible for the 41st spot.",

There\u2019s a lot of hype and importance to the sport to have people like (Castroneves) that come in and, if they miss the race, it kind of hurts the whole thing.",
      "\"So I get it, but I also wish some of our past champions were respected in the same way in some sense.\u201d",
      "Castroneves will use the provisional only if he fails in traditional qualifying to claim one of the four open spots in what was supposed to be a 40-car field. If he uses it, the 41 cars will be the most in the Daytona 500 since 2015, when 43 cars was still standard.",
      "Trackhouse and Castroneves also won't receive any points or payouts if he's the 41st driver, and all drivers who finish behind him will be moved up one position in the standings.",
      "The rule has divided the field, even though it probably will come into play only at Daytona International Speedway, where nine drivers are vying for the four open spots. NASCAR's charter system guarantees entry to 36 cars every race.",
      "\u201cAside from the Daytona 500, we don\u2019t get in a spot very often where drivers of that caliber are going home,\" Tyler Reddick said. \"I don\u2019t know where to fall on this. On one hand, I would hate for a guy like Lewis Hamilton to come over here and attempt to start the 500... (and) something keeps him from running the race. We also don\u2019t just want to let them have a spot in the race \u2014 like, they have to earn it.\u201d",
      "Logically, if multiple drivers had requested the provisional, the most sense would have been for it to go to the highest qualifier.",
      "Nope.",
      "If NASCAR does receive multiple requests, NASCAR will decide who the designated \u201cworld-class driver\u201d is ahead of the event. The criteria listed in the charter for the rule states \"the \u201cOpen Exemption\u201d position is intended for a driver who will significantly impact the promotion of the event and grow the prominence of the sport.",
      "In a competition briefing held for media last month, a hypothetical scenario was posed about what NASCAR would do if seven-time Formula 1 champion Hamilton, four-time F1 champion Max Verstappen, six-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and Johnson, who is also a NASCAR Hall of Famer, all put in a request for the same race.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to have that problem,\u201d said John Probst, NASCAR senior vice president of racing development.",
      "NASCAR could have that problem later this year when it goes to Mexico City, where several teams are exploring deals to enter Juan Pablo Montoya in the race, and who knows who could show up at a road course \u2014 Shane van Gisbergen was brought into the inaugural street race at Chicago, won it and by the end of the year had left his Australian V8 Supercars career behind for NASCAR.",
      "At Indianapolis in 2023, former F1 drivers Jenson Button and Kamui Kobayashi were both in the field, while Button was part of the same field as Kimi Raikkonen to make it two F1 world champions in the 2023 race at Circuit of the Americas.",
      "\u201cI can argue both sides of the fence. You\u2019d hate to have a Helio Castroneves, a Max Verstappen, a Lewis Hamilton or someone come in to run a race and then miss the show due to something silly,\u201d Chase Elliott said. \"So I can certainly see that aspect of it from a promoter. But I also think that with prestigious races, there should be some sort of integrity in making the show.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s part of what makes the race prestigious. You know, it\u2019s a hard event to make. I think you see that with the Indianapolis 500, or you see that at the Chili Bowl, right? It\u2019s a hard race to make. It\u2019s a big deal just to get into the show. I just don\u2019t want to ever degrade or hurt the long-term integrity of the sport and take the prestige out of events that should be some of our biggest days of the year.\u201d",

      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- The Daytona 500 has NASCAR\u2019s most unique \u2014 and complicated \u2014 qualifying format.",
      "And it got more convoluted this year with the largest number of entrants in a decade and a new rule that could add a 41st driver to the 40-car field.",
      "There are 36 guys already locked into Sunday\u2019s 500-mile race because their teams own charters, which guarantee them entry into every race on the Cup Series schedule. The remaining four spots are filled by non-chartered cars, often referred to as \u201copen teams.\"",
      "There are nine drivers \u2014 the most since 2015 \u2014 vying for those spots: Anthony Alfredo, Justin Allgaier, Helio Castroneves, Jimmie Johnson, Corey LaJoie, B.J. McLeod, Chandler Smith, Martin Truex Jr. and J.J. Yeley.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just seven whatevers,\" Johnson said. \"When you look through the affiliations and how those cars play out, it\u2019s going to be a very stressful qualifying.\u201d",
      "They can get into \u201cThe Great American Race\u201d two ways, with two spots going to the drivers who turn the fastest laps in qualifying Wednesday and two more spots being determined through qualifying races Thursday.",
      "Although Castroneves is driving for an open team, the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner is locked into the field through a new rule that allows NASCAR to invite a \u201cworld-class driver\u201d to each event. His Trackhouse Racing team was the only one to apply before the deadline, so he was the only driver NASCAR considered for the provisional spot.",
      "But there\u2019s a catch. If Castroneves uses the provisional, his team gets no prize money. So he will try to qualify his way in, and if he does, the Daytona 500 would be a 40-car field \u2014 and five open cars would miss the race. If he doesn\u2019t qualify, he would get in via the provisional \u2014 and the 500 would have 41 cars.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the nine, in alphabetical order:",
      "Alfredo, 25, returns to Daytona with Beard Motorsports. Alfredo finished 27th with the team last year. He has two top-10s in 41 career Cup starts. Founded by the late Mark Beard Sr., Beard Motorsports is trying to make the field for the seventh time since 2017.",
      "The reigning Xfinity Series champion will be behind the wheel for JR Motorsports\u2019 first attempt at making the Daytona 500. JRM is owned by two-time Daytona 500 winner Dale Earnhardt Jr., whose entry is being sponsored by country music star Chris Stapleton. Allgaier, 38, is winless is 82 Cup starts.",
      "Castroneves will make his NASCAR debut in the No. 91 Chevrolet regardless of how he qualifies. The 49-year-old Brazilian is one of four drivers to have won the Indy 500 four times (2001, \u201902, \u201909, \u201921). He has found success at Daytona, too, having won the 24 Hours at Daytona three times.",
      "The seven-time Cup champion and two-time Daytona 500 winner, now the majority owner of Legacy Motor Club, is entering two races this year. The 49-year-old Johnson will be attempting to make his 22nd appearance in the 500 but will have to qualify for the third straight year. Johnson's paint scheme was designed with input from NBA great Shaquille O'Neal.",
      "LaJoie, 33, is running a partial schedule for Rick Ware Racing and trying to make his ninth consecutive Daytona 500. He has three top-10 finishes in the season opener, including a career-best fourth last year.",
      "McLeod, owner and driver at Live Fast Motorsports, sold his charter for a reported $40 million to Spire Motorsports in 2023. It gave McLeod the freedom to pick and choose when and where he races, and Daytona is high on the list. The 41-year-old McLeod has five Daytona 500 starts, with a best finish of 19th.",
      "Smith is attempting to make the race with Garage 66, replacing Mike Wallace in the No. 66 Ford. Smith, who is slated to drive a full Truck Series schedule, last tried (and failed) to make the 500 in 2023 with Kaulig Racing. The 22-year-old Smith has started three Cup races, including a 15th-place showing in the 2023 summer race.",
      "Truex retired from full-time competition last season, but the 2017 Cup champion entered the race with TRICON Garage. His No. 56 Toyota is getting technical support from Joe Gibbs Racing. Truex, 45, is winless in 20 Daytona 500 starts but came home second in 2016 in one of the closest finishes in NASCAR history.",
      "Yeley is trying to make his sixth Daytona 500 and first since 2015. The 48-year-old driver is winless in 386 Cup starts and is partnering with NY Racing Team to pilot the No. 44 Chevrolet.",

      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court has ruled that a former lawyer for pro-wrestling impresario Vince McMahon was wrong to withhold some documents from a federal grand jury",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court has ruled that a former lawyer for pro-wrestling impresario Vince McMahon was wrong to withhold some documents from a federal grand jury",
      "A former lawyer for pro-wrestling impresario Vince McMahon was wrong to withhold some documents from a federal grand jury as it investigated how the former WWE boss handled multimillion-dollar settlement agreements with two female employees who accused him of sexual abuse, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.",
      "Three judges on the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals in New York upheld a lower court ruling that said the documents were not protected by attorney-client privilege because of an exception for \u201ccrime or fraud.\u201d",
      "The appeals court said the lower court judge found prosecutors had reasonable grounds to believe that McMahon and his lawyer illegally \u201ccircumvented\u201d the WWE's internal controls and created false records when they concealed the employees' claims and settlement agreements from the company, and that they made false and misleading statements to the company's auditors \u2014 even though McMahon paid the settlements with funds that did not come from the company.",
      "The appellate panel said that while McMahon's lawyer submitted many materials in response to a grand jury subpoena, they also submitted a log of 208 documents that were being withheld under assertions of attorney-client privilege.",
      "Though the identities of the parties were not disclosed in the appeals court opinion, a person familiar with the matter confirmed the unnamed \u201cformer Chief Executive Officer of a \u201dpublicly traded company\" was McMahon. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss details that have not been made public.",
      "The status of the grand jury investigation was not immediately clear. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has declined to comment when asked about the investigation, which it has not publicly disclosed.",
      "Representatives for McMahon, who has denied wrongdoing, said they had no immediate comment on the court ruling. McMahon has previously suggested that he was no longer under investigation.",
      "In January, McMahon said in a statement that \u201cnearly three years of investigation by different governmental agencies\u201d into his actions had ended. The statement came as the federal Securities and Exchange Commission announced it had settled charges against McMahon over his failure to disclose the settlement agreements with the two now-former employees to WWE officials.",
      "\u201cIn the end, there was never anything more to this than minor accounting errors with regard to some personal payments that I made several years ago while I was CEO of WWE,\" the statement said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that I can now put all this behind me.\u201d",
      "The appeals court, however, said in Monday's ruling that the case \u201cconcerns proceedings currently before a grand jury. At present, no indictments have been issued.\u201d",
      "The opinion disclosed some new details of the grand jury probe.",
      "Representatives for one of the former employees who got a settlement agreement from McMahon, Janel Grant, declined to comment Monday.",
      "McMahon resigned from WWE\u2019s parent company in January 2024 after Grant filed a federal lawsuit accusing him and another former executive of serious sexual misconduct. At the time, McMahon stepped down from his position as executive chair of the board of directors at WWE\u2019s parent company, TKO Group Holdings. He continued to deny wrongdoing following the filing of the lawsuit.",
      "McMahon stepped down as WWE\u2019s CEO in 2022 amid a company investigation into allegations that match those in the lawsuit.",
      "Grant has said she was pressured into leaving her job with the WWE and signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit, which alleges sexual battery and trafficking, also seeks to have the agreement declared invalid, saying McMahon breached the deal by giving her $1 million and failing to pay the rest.",
      "The $3 million settlement is mentioned in Monday's appellate court ruling, along with another $7.5 million settlement McMahon made with another former employee.",
      "The Associated Press does not normally name people who make sexual assault allegations unless they come forward publicly, which Grant did.",
      "Prosecutors served subpoenas on McMahon's lawyer, who is unnamed in court documents, and the attorney's firm in September 2023, seeking all communications between McMahon, his attorney and the law firm regarding the two former employees, according to the appellate court. The lawyer helped McMahon negotiate the settlements, the court said.",
      "When the lawyer withheld some of the documents claiming attorney-client privilege, prosecutors asked the lower court to compel production of the records \u2014 leading to the appeal decided Monday.",
      "The appellate judges wrote, \u201cBecause the settlement agreements resolving the Victims\u2019 claims were \u2018structured and negotiated ... to keep them hidden from (the Company),' the district court found that \u2019all communications about the claims and settlement agreements were made in furtherance of the criminal scheme to keep (the Company) and its auditors unaware of the allegations.'\u201d",

    "summary": "Red Auerbach once got ejected from an All-Star Game for arguing a call",
    "story": [
      "Red Auerbach once got ejected from an All-Star Game for arguing a call",
      "Red Auerbach once got ejected from an All-Star Game for arguing a call. Rick Barry and Bob Cousy each fouled out of All-Star Games twice, the only players who can say that. Dwyane Wade was whistled for the first flagrant All-Star foul after breaking Kobe Bryant\u2019s nose.",
      "As the story goes, Wade called Bryant not long after that 2012 game and attempted to apologize. Turned out, there was no need. Wade\u2019s recollection of what Bryant said? \u201cBro, I love it,\u201d Wade said in a conversation with Kevin Garnett, a clip that has been a social media standard ever since.",
      "The NBA doesn't want coaches to get kicked out, anyone to get into foul trouble or anyone getting hurt. But they've asked, begged and pleaded for years with players in an effort that the All-Star Game get taken more seriously. And the latest solution is a radical one: a mini-tournament.",
      "Welcome to an All-Star format like none other: three games, no clock, first team to 40 points wins, eight-man rosters, and there's a reasonable chance that the team leaving San Francisco on Sunday as winners will have captured that title without having a single All-Star on its roster.",
      "\u201cWe went back to the drawing board,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said.",
      "Here's the big question going into Sunday: Will it work?",
      "To be fair, there were skeptics when Silver added a play-in tournament to determine the final two playoff spots in the Eastern and Western Conferences; by all accounts, the play-in has been a smashing success. There were skeptics when Silver added an in-season tournament now called the NBA Cup; some players say they still don't totally understand the format, but the first two Cup final four weekends in Las Vegas have been big hits as well.",
      "Now, this. The NBA thinks players don't want to go to a 48-minute All-Star Game and play hard for a full game. Perfectly understandable. The proposed solution: short games, where nobody will have to play for long and there's little room for error since only 40 points are needed to win.",
      "Kevin Durant's first response? \u201cI hate it. Absolutely hate it. Terrible,\u201d the Phoenix star and 15-time All-Star said when the league announced the plan in December, though he quickly noted that his initial reaction could have been worded differently.",
      "Perhaps he could have taken the route that perennial All-Star forward Anthony Davis, then of the Los Angeles Lakers and now of the Dallas Mavericks, took when he was asked in December what he thinks of the NBA's new plan.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like it,\u201d Durant said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll see how it goes this year and see if they change it again or not.\u201d",
      "And it could change again, possibly as early as next year.",
      "Some players want the traditional East vs. West format, although the league went back to that last year and it was a 211-186 game \u2014 all dunks and 3-pointers, pretty much \u2014 that broke records and forced the NBA to break the mold on the format.",
      "The NBA tried a target score approach; no clock in the fourth quarter and have the teams chase a set total to ensure that the game ends on a made basket. Some years it worked, some years not so much. They tried having playing captains pick the teams; again, success was mixed.",
      "Next up, the tournament. There is a prize pool of $1.8 million for the All-Star tournament. Each player on the All-Star champion team gets $125,000, each player on the runner-up team will get $50,000 and the players on the teams eliminated in the semifinals will each get $25,000.",
      "\u201cI don't know if everyone understands how this is going to go,\u201d said Miami's Tyler Herro, who'll make his All-Star debut this weekend. \u201cBut everyone will want to win.\u201d",
      "There are four teams in the tournament: three teams picked by Shaquille O'Neal, Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley from the pool of 24 All-Stars, and the fourth will be the team that wins the Rising Stars event on Friday night. The Rising Stars players aren't All-Stars. Some aren't even in the NBA right now; there's a G League team in that event. And the Rising Stars winner could win the All-Star Game \u2014 meaning, yes, guys who aren't currently in the league could win the thing.",
      "Whichever way it shakes out, it will be a massive deviation from last year \u2014 when the East and West each scored at least 42 points in every quarter. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 50 points on his own last year; it'll take only 40 for a team to win a game this year.",
      "\u201cThem trying to shake things up is expected and makes sense,\u201d Oklahoma City All-Star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"But at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to come down to whether the players wanting to go at it, and I would love to see that. Love to be a part of that for sure, and hopefully it happens.\u201d",
      "Heat forward Kevin Love \u2014 who proudly says he took part in All-Star Games where players were competitive and even strategized in the locker rooms before games and at halftimes \u2014 doesn't know when the All-Star Game changed.",
      "He thinks it became part of the evolution within the game; more 3-pointers are shot than ever before and that, combined with everyone just treating it like an exhibition and not Game 7 of the NBA Finals, led to the defense-optional approach the league doesn't want to see anymore.",
      "\u201cI'll tell you if this will work,\u201d Love said. \u201cI'll tell you on Sunday.\u201d",

      "Doncic got multiple standing ovations from a Los Angeles crowd wearing thousands of No. 77 shirts, but his pregame introduction was something he\u2019ll remember for a long time.",
      "\u201cJust the amount of cheering there was in the arena was absolutely unbelievable,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cThat was my favorite part \u2014 and to play again.\u201d",
      "Doncic said James texted him in the morning and offered to do anything to help \u2014 and Doncic took him up on it by taking the final intro spot. They'll swap for the Lakers' next home game next week, Doncic said with a grin.",
      "\u201cShows what kind of person he is,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cHe let me have my moment.\u201d",
      "The Slovenian scorer\u2019s first bucket was a 3-pointer in the opening minutes on his second shot. Doncic scored 11 points while Los Angeles streaked out to a 25-point halftime lead, and he sat down for good with 3:07 left in the third quarter with the Lakers far ahead in their sixth consecutive victory.",
      "The game was Doncic's first since he strained his left calf on Christmas. After a full week to settle in Los Angeles and to return to full strength, Doncic joined James, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and Jaxson Hayes as starters for the streaking Lakers, who had won 11 of 13 even before adding a five-time All-NBA selection to their lineup.",
      "The Lakers have Doncic on a minutes restriction after his injury absence. His legs aren't quite there yet \u2014 he went 1 for 7 on 3-point attempts in his debut \u2014 but his playmaking immediately meshed with his new teammates.",
      "Doncic\u2019s first touch was an alley-oop assist to Hayes, and he hit his 3-pointer moments later. He was serenaded with \u201cLuka! Luka!\u201d chants at the first dead ball, and several times thereafter.",
      "\u201cI just think it could be a thing of beauty, the way we can manipulate the game on the offensive end and get what we want every single possession,\u201d said Reaves, who scored 22 points. \u201cLuka is one of the best passers in the world ... but yeah, I think it\u2019s just the high-level IQ going along with pieces that really fit. (Doncic and James) can shoot the ball, pass the ball, and really play the right way.\u201d",
      "That crowd included Dirk Nowitzki, who overlapped with Doncic for one season in Dallas and served as his mentor. Doncic appeared to be the natural heir to the German Hall of Famer\u2019s incredible run in Dallas \u2014 until current Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison decided otherwise.",
      "Coach JJ Redick, who played alongside Doncic for 13 games in 2021 with the Mavericks, was pleased by Doncic's poise and patience in a landmark game.",
      "\u201cKnowing Luka, whether he will admit this or not, there was probably a little bit of nerves playing for the Lakers for the first time, and the anticipation that this building had,\u201d Redick said. \u201cI thought he handled it really well, and he played really well tonight. ... He didn\u2019t make it about Luka. He made it about playing good basketball and playing Laker basketball.\u201d",
      "James returned from a one-game injury absence Monday when the Lakers began a home-and-home set with the Jazz heading into the All-Star break.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see any world where those two playing together isn\u2019t a good thing,\" Utah coach Will Hardy said. \"Their processing speed mentally is incredible, and so I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d",
      "Doncic had watched three straight Lakers victories from their bench since arriving in Los Angeles a week ago. Reaves scored a career-high 45 points to lead the Lakers past Indiana 124-117 on Saturday without Doncic or James, who sat out to rest his sore ankle.",
      "Doncic began Monday by donating $500,000 to fire recovery efforts in his new community, making an immediate impression with his pledge to help with the damage caused by the rampant wildfires that devastated parts of Southern California last month \u2014 including Pacific Palisades, where Redick's home was lost.",
      "\u201cIt's been so sad to see and learn more about the damage from the wildfires as I landed in LA,\u201d Doncic wrote on his Luka Doncic Foundation's social media channels. \"I can't believe it, and I feel for all the kids who lost their homes, schools and the places where they used to play with their friends.\u201d",
      "Doncic signed his note: \u201cYour new neighbor.\u201d",

      "NASCAR has no shortage of storylines headed into its 76th season",
      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- NASCAR has no shortage of storylines headed into its 76th season and the biggest one is the federal court showdown between the stock car series and NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan.",
      "Jordan's 23XI Cup Series team that he co-owns with three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin didn't like the terms of the take-it-or-leave-it charter offer last fall and, along with Front Row Motorsports, refused to sign as 13 others did. The two teams will race this season \u2014 23XI's driver, Tyler Reddick, was the regular-season champion and a title contender \u2014 as the case proceeds.",
      "23XI and Front Row head into the season-opening Daytona 500 this weekend coming off a flurry of courtroom victories, including one that recognizes and compensates their six combined cars as chartered entries. A trial is set for December after the season ends.",
      "There are enough positives that everyone seemed excited to get back to racing when they gathered this month for a throwback to the early days of NASCAR at historic Bowman-Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.",
      "\u2014 This year marks the start of a new seven-year television package that welcomes Amazon and Warner Bros. Discovery to a multi-network deal spanning the February through November season.",
      "\u2014 NASCAR will take the Cup Series outside the United States for a race that counts for the first time in the modern era. Its two previous points races outside the U.S. were in Canada, in 1952 and 1958, and all other events outside the country were exhibitions. NASCAR will race in Mexico City in June, a chance to stars as Mexican driver Daniel Suarez. NASCAR will use the same track that Formula 1 uses, and the hope is to land younger fans.",
      "\u201cI actually think things are in an OK place,\u201d said Chase Elliott, voted the most popular driver by fans seven times. The son of Hall of Fame driver Bill Elliott said he believes NASCAR's current leadership group \u201chas been open to more change over the past three or four years\" than the past three decades.",
      "NASCAR has been owned and operated by the Daytona-based France family since its 1948 inception.",
      "\u201cAs long as we\u2019re willing to say that some of the stuff hasn\u2019t been good, then it\u2019s fine,\u201d Elliott said of competition issues the past few years. \"I hope we can continue to go in a good direction.\u201d",
      "Nine drivers will attempt to qualify for one of the four open spots in the Daytona 500. Among the nine are seven-time NASCAR champion and two-time race winner Jimmie Johnson, former Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr., and four-time Indianapolis 500 winner Helio Castroneves in his NASCAR debut.",
      "NASCAR last month went public with a new rule that could expand the field to 41 to accommodate a world-class driver. It was earmarked for Castroneves, who, if he doesn't earn one of the four open spots, will race as an extra car not eligible for payment or points.",
      "Johnson and Truex could have been considered for the waiver if they asked at least 90 days in advance, language NASCAR said was in the charters signed by teams in September. Trackhouse Racing was the only team to request the waiver, if needed, for Castroneves.",
      "\u201cI just think it reeks of desperation,\u201d said Hamlin, who as co-owner of 23XI Racing has signed some splashy one-off entrants, including former F1 drivers Juan Pablo Montoya and Kamui Kobayashi.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how nice you can really say it. It just feels like you are really trying to get any kind of headline you can to be relevant and I don\u2019t love it,\" Hamlin said of the provisional. \u201cYou are the premier stock car series in the U.S., the premier racing sport in the U.S. \u2014 be the big boys and force people to come in here and get their credentials and do it the natural way.\u201d",
      "The rule will be tested this week at Daytona International Speedway, where two open spots will be awarded Wednesday based on speed and the other two awarded in Thursday's two qualifying races.",
      "\u2014 Team Penske has won three consecutive Cup Series championships with Ryan Blaney's win sandwiched between a pair of Joey Logano titles. Logano's third overall title broke a tie with Kyle Busch as the only active drivers with multiple championships. Busch is trying to bounce back from last year, when his record run of 19 consecutive seasons with at least one win came to an end.",
      "\u2014 Trackhouse, 23XI and Front Row have all expanded into three-car teams with the charters from Stewart-Haas Racing, which ceased operations as a four-car program at the end of last season. Gene Haas will field one car branded Haas Factory for driver Cole Custer.",
      "\u2014 Spire Motorsports partnered with TWG Motorsports, an operation run by Dan Towriss and Mark Walter. The two were granted expansion with Cadillac onto the F1 grid for 2026 and are the new majority owners of Andretti Global in IndyCar.",
      "\u2014 William Byron is the defending Daytona 500 winner, and Hendrick Motorsports teammate Kyle Larson is the hottest driver in motorsports right now with offseason wins in big sprint car races in Australia and Oklahoma.",
      "\u2014 NASCAR will spend 2025 reviewing the playoff structure because fans are showing boredom with the current format and didn't like Logano winning the title. There was also a controversial penultimate race in which NASCAR accused the manufacturers of manipulating the finish to set the championship quartet.",
      "\u2014 NASCAR vowed to tighten the rule book and warned of penalties for anyone who tries to game the system to determine an outcome. The first test comes with the Daytona 500, a race in which the cars from Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota all work withing an overall strategy for each brand.",
      "\u2014 The season starts on Fox, which has maintained its long relationship with NASCAR for this new $7.7 billion television deal. Fox Sports will broadcast 12 races this year, while NBC Sports has 14. New partners Amazon and TNT each have five races, and newly inducted Hall of Famer Carl Edwards could return to NASCAR as part of all the new talent.",
      "The drivers have to do their part, Logano said, and itstarts with navigating all the new platforms. It is up to the drivers, he said, to make sure viewers can find them.",
      "\u201cI think the biggest challenge I see this year is going to be educating our fans where to watch the race, that's my number one concern,\" said Logano. \u201cI think that's probably the same for everybody in the industry. We've got to communicate with our fans where to watch and how to watch.\u201d",

      "The hurdles he faced along the way helped lead to where he stood Monday morning: a Super Bowl champion and MVP.",
      "\u201cWhen you hoist those trophies, it\u2019s more so about the journey and less about the results,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cObviously we\u2019re going to be judged by results and that\u2019s what everyone talks about. The journey is what fuels us and makes us who we are.\u201d",
      "The finish to the 2024 season for the Philadelphia Eagles with a dominating 40-22 win over the two-time defending champion Kansas City Chiefs for their 16th win in 17 games comes in stark contrast to 2023.",
      "The Eagles started 10-1 that season and looked like they could have a chance to avenge a Super Bowl loss the previous season to the Chiefs. But then they lost five of their final six regular-season games and were blown out in a wild-card loss at Tampa Bay, with the brunt of the criticism being focused on Hurts and coach Nick Sirianni.",
      "But Sirianni believes the celebration that happened Sunday night at the Superdome wouldn't have been possible without the disappointment from 2023.",
      "\u201cAdversity has a tendency to bring you together,\u201d he said. \u201cI look back on last year and how last year ended and I\u2019m grateful. As crazy as it sounds, I\u2019m grateful how last year ended because it shaped us to who we are today and where we\u2019re standing today.\u201d",
      "Hurts has been shaped by adversity throughout his career. He lost the college football championship game as a freshman at Alabama in the 2016 season and then was benched at halftime the following year in the title game and could only watch as Tua Tagovailoa led the Crimson Tide to a title.",
      "Hurts spent the next season as a backup before transferring to Oklahoma, where he improved as a passer and was drafted in the second round by the Eagles in 2020.",
      "The pick was panned by some because Philadelphia already had Carson Wentz in place, but Hurts took over as starter late in his rookie season. He helped the Eagles make the playoffs the following year in his first full season as a starter and reached the Super Bowl in the 2022 season.",
      "The questions about his ability as a pure passer lingered despite his success on the field, but Hurts may have put them to rest at least for now thanks to the way he controlled the game Sunday night against Steve Spagnuolo's defense.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s all said and done for me, I won\u2019t measure my success by any numbers or statistics or passing yards or touchdowns or anything like that,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cI measure it off rings and championships. That\u2019s how I look at it.\u201d",
      "Hurts had both the stats and the championship against the Chiefs. He went 17 for 22 for 221 yards and two touchdowns, and he ran for 72 yards and a touchdown, joining Hall of Famer Joe Montana as the only quarterbacks to throw for at least 200 yards and two TDs and rush for at least 50 yards and a score in a Super Bowl.",
      "While that performance led to Hurts winning the award for Most Valuable Player, the most valuable person for the Eagles might have been defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who delivered a signature performance in a long career that had lacked only a championship.",
      "The Eagles sacked Patrick Mahomes six times \u2014 the first time that has happened in his 8-year NFL career \u2014 and generated three takeaways, including a pick-6 by rookie Cooper DeJean.",
      "They managed to do that without calling a single blitz all night, according to NFL Next Gen Stats, as Fangio's defense repeatedly took away Mahomes' first read on plays, allowing the four-man front to get pressure.",
      "\u201cObviously we are very talented on that side of the field,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cVic Fangio is one of the best coordinators of all time. He cemented his legacy in being maybe the best defensive coordinator of all time last night.\u201d",
      "Hurts' legacy has yet to be determined; he is only 26 and has many years of football remaining. He knows there is still plenty more to do even after winning a Super Bowl MVP.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a journey. It\u2019s all a journey and I\u2019m still yet to arrive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still yet to arrive as a team.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.",
      "Trump said that he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It's unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yermak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally doesn't freeze military support. That would be devastating for the country, which has been at war for nearly three years after Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for more than 20 critical raw materials and concluded that if the country joins the 27-nation EU, it could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It's unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying numerous investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles",
      "WASHINGTON -- Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying a crushing number of federal investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles.",
      "Now, Musk\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump means many of those federal headaches could vanish within weeks or months.",
      "On the potential chopping block: crash investigations into Tesla\u2019s partially automated vehicles; a Justice Department criminal probe examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars\u2019 self-driving capabilities; and a government mandate to report crash data on vehicles using technology like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.",
      "The consequences of such actions could prove dire, say safety advocates who credit the federal investigations and recalls with saving lives.",
      "\u201cMusk wants to run the Department of Transportation,\u201d said Missy Cummings, a former senior safety adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of investigations that are underway with Tesla. They will all be gone.\u201d",
      "Within days of Trump taking office, the White House and Musk began waging an unbridled war against the federal government \u2014 freezing spending and programs while sacking a host of career employees, including prosecutors and government watchdogs typically shielded from such brazen dismissals without cause.",
      "The actions have sparked outcries from legal scholars who say the Trump administration\u2019s actions are without modern-day precedent and are already upending the balance of power in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk\u2019s other companies. However, snuffing out federal investigations or jettisoning safety initiatives would be an easier task than their assault on regulators and the bureaucracy.",
      "Investigations into companies like Tesla can be shut down overnight by the new leaders of agencies. And safety programs created through an agency order or initiative \u2014 not by laws passed by Congress or adopted through a formal regulatory process \u2014 can also be quickly dissolved by new leaders. Unlike many of the dismantling efforts that Trump and Musk have launched in recent weeks, stalling or killing such probes and programs would not be subject to legal challenges.",
      "As such, the temporal and fragile nature of the federal probes and safety programs make them easy targets for those seeking to weaken government oversight and upend long-established norms.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\u2019s been stifling Tesla,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a veteran Wall Street technology and automobile industry analyst.",
      "Among Musk\u2019s businesses, the federal government\u2019s power over Tesla to investigate, order recalls, and mandate crash data reporting is perhaps the most wide-ranging. However, the ways the Trump administration could quickly ease up on Tesla also apply in some measure to other companies in Musk\u2019s sprawling business empire.",
      "A host of Musk's other businesses \u2014 such as his aerospace company SpaceX and his social media company X \u2014 are subjects of federal investigations.",
      "Musk\u2019s businesses are also intertwined with the federal government, pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX, for example, has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla, meanwhile, has received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "Musk, Tesla\u2019s billionaire CEO, has found himself in his newly influential position by enthusiastically backing Trump\u2019s third bid for the White House. He was the largest donor to the campaign, plunging more than $270 million of his vast fortune into Trump\u2019s political apparatus, most of it during the final months of the heated presidential race.",
      "Those donations and his efforts during the campaign \u2014 including the transformation of his social media platform X into a firehose of pro-Trump commentary \u2014 have been rewarded by Trump, who has tapped the entrepreneur to oversee efforts to slash government regulations and spending.",
      "As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk operates out of an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most White House staff work and from where he has launched his assault on the federal government. Musk\u2019s power under DOGE is being challenged in the courts.",
      "Even before Trump took office, there were signs that Musk\u2019s vast influence with the new administration was registering with the public \u2014 and paying dividends for Tesla.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock surged more than 60% by December. Since then, its stock price has dropped, but still remains 40% higher than it was before Trump's election.",
      "\u201cFor Musk,\u201d said Ives, the technology analyst, \u201cbetting on Trump is a poker move for the ages.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how it would handle investigations and government oversight involving Tesla or other Musk companies. A spokesman for the transition team said last month that the White House would ensure that DOGE and \u201cthose involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines and conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "In the weeks before Trump took office on Jan. 20, the president-elect\u2019s transition team recommended changes that would benefit the billionaire and his car company, including scrapping the federal order requiring carmakers to report crash data involving self-driving and partially automated technology.",
      "The action would be a boon for Tesla, which has reported a vast majority of the crashes that triggered a series of investigations and recalls.",
      "The transition team also recommended shelving a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, something Musk has publicly called for.",
      "\u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X as he campaigned and raised money for Trump in July.",
      "Auto industry experts say the move would have a nominal impact on Tesla \u2014 by far the largest electric vehicle maker in the U.S. \u2014 but have a potentially devastating impact on its competitors in the EV sector since they are still struggling to secure a foothold in the market.",
      "Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Before the election, he posted a message on X, saying he had never asked Trump \u201cfor any favors, nor has he offered me any.\u201d",
      "Although most of the changes that Musk might seek for Tesla could unfold quickly, there is one long-term goal that could impact the autonomous vehicle industry for decades to come.",
      "Though nearly 30 states have rules that specifically govern self-driving cars, the federal government has yet to craft such regulations.",
      "During a late October call with Tesla investors, as Musk was pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s campaign, he signaled support for having the federal government create these rules.",
      "\u201cThere should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cIf there\u2019s a department of government efficiency, I\u2019ll try to help make that happen.\u201d",
      "Musk leads that very organization.",
      "People whose lives have been forever changed by Tesla crashes fear that dangerous and fatal accidents may increase if the federal government\u2019s investigative and recall powers are restricted.",
      "They say they worry that the company may otherwise never be held accountable for its failures, like the one that took the life of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon.",
      "The college student was on a date with her boyfriend, gazing at the stars on the side of a rural Florida road, when they were struck by an out-of-control Tesla driving on Autopilot \u2014 a system that allows Tesla cars to operate without driver input. The car had blown through a stop sign, a flashing light and five yellow warning signs, according to dashcam video and a police report.",
      "Benavides Leon died at the scene; her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, suffered injuries but survived. A federal investigation determined that Autopilot in Teslas at this time was faulty and needed repairs.",
      "\u201cWe, as a family, have never been the same,\u201d said Benavides Leon\u2019s sister, Neima. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and everything that we design and we build has to be by important codes and regulations. This technology cannot be an exception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has to be investigated when it fails,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause it does fail.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement on Twitter in December 2023, Tesla pointed to an earlier lawsuit the Benavides Leon's family had brought against the driver who struck the college student. He testified that despite using Autopilot, \u201cI was highly aware that it was still my responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.\u201d",
      "Tesla also said the driver \u201cwas pressing the accelerator to maintain 60 mph,\" an action that effectively overrode Autopilot, which would have otherwise restricted the speed to 45 mph on the rural route, something Benavides Leon's attorney disputes.",
      "The federal agency that has the most power over Tesla \u2014 and the entire automobile industry \u2014 is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation.",
      "NHTSA sets automobile safety standards that must be met before vehicles can enter the marketplace. It also has a quasi-law enforcement arm, the Office of Defects Investigation, which has the power to launch probes into crashes and seek recalls for safety defects.",
      "The agency has six pending investigations into Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, prompted by dozens of crashes that took place when the computerized systems were in use.",
      "Other federal agencies are also investigating Musk and Tesla, and all of those probes could be sidelined by Musk-friendly officials:",
      "\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are separately investigating whether Musk and Tesla overstated the autonomous capabilities of their vehicles, creating dangerous situations in which drivers may over rely on the car\u2019s technology.",
      "\u2014The Justice Department is also probing whether Tesla misled customers about how far its electric vehicles can travel before needing a charge.",
      "\u2014The National Labor Relations Board is weighing 12 unfair labor practice allegations leveled by workers at Tesla plants.",
      "\u2014The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is asking a federal judge to force Tesla to enact reforms and pay compensatory and punitive damages and backpay to Black employees who say they were subjected to racist attacks. In a federal lawsuit, the agency has alleged that supervisors and other employees at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, routinely hurled racist insults at Black employees.",
      "Experts said most, if not all, of those investigations could be shut down, especially at the Justice Department where Trump has long shown a willingness to meddle in the department\u2019s affairs. The Trump administration has already ordered the firing of dozens of prosecutors who handled the criminal cases from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.",
      "\u201cDOJ is not going to be prosecuting Elon Musk,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Justice Department's public integrity section who served during the Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. \u201cI\u2019d expect that any investigations that were ongoing will be ground to an abrupt end.\u201d",
      "Trump has also taken steps to gain control of the NLRB and EEOC. Last month, he fired Democratic members of the board and commission, breaking with decades of precedent. One member has sued, and two others are exploring legal options.",
      "Tesla and Musk have denied wrongdoing in all those investigations and are fighting the probes.",
      "The federal agency that appears to have enjoyed the most success in changing Tesla\u2019s behavior is NHTSA, an organization of about 750 staffers that has forced the company to hand over crash data and cooperate in its investigations and requested recalls.",
      "\u201cNHTSA has been a thorn in Musk\u2019s side for over the last decade, and he\u2019s grappled with almost every three-letter agency in the Beltway,\u201d said Ives, the Wall Street analyst who covers the technology sector and automobile industry. \u201cThat\u2019s all created what looks to be a really big soap opera in 2025.\u201d",
      "Musk has repeatedly blamed the federal government for impeding Tesla\u2019s progress and creating negative publicity with recalls of his cars after its self-driving technology malfunctions or crashes.",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 should be recalled,\u201d Musk posted on Twitter (now X) in 2014. Two years ago, he posted, \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\u201d",
      "Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said some investigations might continue under Trump, but a recall is less likely to happen if a defect is found.",
      "As with most car companies, Tesla\u2019s recalls have so far been voluntary. The threat of public hearings about a defect that precedes a NHTSA-ordered recall has generally prompted car companies to act on their own.",
      "That threat could be easily stripped away by the new NHTSA administrator, who will be a Trump appointee.",
      "\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a threat of recall, will Tesla do them?\u201d Brooks said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is where politics seeps in.\u201d",
      "Among the active NHTSA investigations, several are examining fundamental aspects of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems that were in use when dozens of crashes occurred.",
      "An investigation of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system started in October after Tesla reported four crashes to NHTSA in which the vehicles had trouble navigating through sun glare, fog and airborne dust. In one of the accidents, an Arizona woman was killed after stopping on a freeway to help someone involved in another crash.",
      "Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla has twice recalled the \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d feature for software updates. The technology \u2014 the most advanced of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot systems \u2014 is supposed to allow drivers to travel from point to point with little human intervention. But repeated malfunctions led NHTSA to recently launch a new inquiry that includes a crash in July that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle.",
      "NHTSA announced its latest investigation in January into \u201cActually Smart Summon,\u201d a Tesla technology that allows drivers to remotely move a car, after the agency learned of four incidents from a driver and several media reports.",
      "The agency said that in each collision, the vehicles were using the system that Tesla pushed out in a September software update that was \u201cfailing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash.\u201d NHTSA also criticized Tesla for failing to notify the agency of those accidents.",
      "NHTSA is also conducting a probe into whether a 2023 recall of Autopilot, the most basic of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driver assistance systems, was effective.",
      "That recall was supposed to boost the number of controls and alerts to keep drivers engaged; it had been prompted by an earlier NHTSA investigation that identified hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot that resulted in scores of injuries and more than a dozen deaths.",
      "In a letter to Tesla in April, agency investigators noted that crashes involving Autopilot continue and that they could not observe a difference between warnings issued to drivers before or after the new software had been installed.",
      "Critics have said that Teslas don\u2019t have proper sensors to be fully self-driving. Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or in poor visibility conditions. Tesla, on the other hand, relies only on cameras to spot hazards.",
      "Musk has said that human drivers rely on their eyesight, so autonomous cars should be able to also get by with just cameras. He has called technology that relies on radar and light detection to discern objects a \u201cfool\u2019s errand.\u201d",
      "Bryant Walker Smith, a Stanford Law School scholar and a leading automated driving expert, said Musk\u2019s contention that the federal government is holding him back is not accurate. The problem, Smith said, is that Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicles cannot perform as advertised.",
      "\u201cBlaming the federal government for holding them back, it provides a convenient, if dubious, scapegoat for the lack of an actual automated driving system that works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith and other autonomous vehicle experts say Musk has felt pressure to provide Tesla shareholders with excuses for repeated delays in rolling out its futuristic cars. The financial stake is enormous, which Musk acknowledged during a 2022 interview. He said the development of a fully self-driving vehicle was \u201creally the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.\u201d",
      "The collisions from Tesla\u2019s malfunctioning technology on its vehicles have led not only to deaths but also catastrophic injuries that have forever altered people\u2019s lives.",
      "Attorneys representing people injured in Tesla crashes \u2014 or who represent surviving family members of those who died \u2014 say without NHTSA, the only other way to hold the car company accountable is through civil lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWhen government can\u2019t do it, then the civil justice system is left to pick up the slack,\u201d said Brett Schreiber, whose law firm is handling four Tesla cases.",
      "However, Schreiber and other lawyers say if the federal government\u2019s investigative powers don\u2019t remain intact, Tesla may also not be held accountable in court.",
      "In the pending wrongful death lawsuit that Neima Benavides Leon filed against Tesla after her sister\u2019s death, her attorney told a Miami district judge the lawsuit would have likely been dropped if NHTSA hadn\u2019t investigated and found defects with the Autopilot system.",
      "\u201cAll along we were hoping that the NHTSA investigation would produce what it did, in fact, end up producing, which is a finding of product defect and a recall,\u201d attorney Doug Eaton said during a March court hearing. \u201cAnd we had told you very early on in the case if NHTSA had not found that, we may very well drop the case. But they did, in fact, find this.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:06:26 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t work&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t last very long",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don\u2019t last very long",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don't last very long. Instead he wants the government to exclusively move to plastic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous situation. We\u2019re going back to plastic straws,\u201d Trump said as he signed an executive order to reverse federal purchasing policies that encourage paper straws and restrict plastic ones. The order directs federal agencies to stop buying paper straws \u201cand otherwise ensure that paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.\u201d",
      "The move by Trump \u2014 who has long railed against paper straws, and whose 2019 reelection campaign sold Trump-branded reusable plastic straws for $15 per pack of 10 \u2014 targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.",
      "Trump declared President Joe Biden\u2019s policy \u201cDEAD!\u201d in a social media post over the weekend.",
      "While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said Monday that he thinks \"it's OK\u201d to continue using them. \u201cI don\u2019t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they\u2019re eating, as they\u2019re munching their way through the ocean,'' he said at a White House announcement.",
      "Several U.S. states and cities have banned plastic straws, and some restaurants no longer automatically give them to customers. But plastic straws are only a small part of the problem. The environment is littered with single-use plastic food and beverage containers \u2014 water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, shopping bags and more.",
      "Around the world, the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic enters the ocean every minute from a range of sources, including plastic bags, toothbrushes, bottles, food packaging and more, experts say. As those materials break down in the environment, microplastics are turning up in the stomachs of fish, birds and other animals, as well as in human blood and tissue.",
      "And plastic manufacturing releases planet-warming greenhouse gases and other dangerous pollutants. More than 90% of plastic products are derived from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and millions of tons of plastic waste enter the world\u2019s oceans every year. Many multinational companies have moved away from plastic straws and have made reducing plastic use across their operations central to their sustainability goals, making Trump's decision an outlier in the business world.",
      "Trump\u2019s order is \u201cmore about messaging than finding solutions,\u2033 said Christy Leavitt, plastics campaign director for the environmental group Oceana, noting that most U.S. voters support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic packaging and foodware.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is moving in the wrong direction on single-use plastics,'' Leavitt said. \u201cThe world is facing a plastic pollution crisis, and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today.\u201d",
      "The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump's move.",
      "\u201cStraws are just the beginning,\u201d Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. \u201c\u2018Back to Plastic\u2019 is a movement we should all get behind.\u201d",
      "More than 390 million straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network. Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, the group says.",
      "\"To prevent another sea turtle from becoming a victim to plastic, we must make personal lifestyle alterations to fight for these species,'' the group said in a statement.",
      "Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.",
      "Globally, nations are creating a treaty to address plastic pollution. Leaders met for a week in South Korea late last year but didn\u2019t reach an agreement. Talks resume this year as more than 100 countries pursue a pact that limits plastic production as well as tackles cleanup and recycling.",
      "The U.S., China and Germany are the biggest players in the global plastics trade. U.S. manufacturers have asked Trump to remain at the negotiating table, and to revert to Biden\u2019s previous position that focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse.",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who presented the executive order to Trump, told him the push for paper straws has cost the government and private industry \u201can absolute ton of money and left consumers all over the country wildly dissatisfied with their straws. It really is something that affects ordinary Americans in their everyday lives.\"",

      "Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations\u2019 climate chief calls \u201camong the most important policy documents governments will produce this century.\"",
      "Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations' climate chief calls \u201camong the most important policy documents governments will produce this century\u201d \u2014 their plans on how they will cut emissions of heat-trapping gases.",
      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",
      "The deadline \u2014 set in the Paris agreement to be nine months before the next international climate negotiations, this year in Belem, Brazil \u2014 is 11:59 p.m. in Germany, where the U.N. climate office is.",
      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

      "PARIS -- JD Vance is stepping onto the world stage for the first time as U.S. vice president this week, using a high-profile artificial intelligence summit in France and a gathering of national security leaders in Germany to showcase Donald Trump\u2019s more assertive approach to diplomacy.",
      "The 40-year-old vice president, who was just 18 months into his tenure as a senator before joining Trump\u2019s ticket, is expected, while in Paris, to push back on European efforts to tighten AI oversight while advocating for a more open, innovation-driven approach.",
      "The AI summit has drawn world leaders, top tech executives, and policymakers to discuss artificial intelligence\u2019s impact on global security, economics, and governance. High-profile attendees also include Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, signaling Beijing\u2019s deep interest in shaping global AI standards. The event highlights a growing divide between the European Union and other players pushing for more regulations to make the fast-moving technology safer for the public, and the U.S., where the Trump administration has prioritized business-friendly policies and technological dominance.",
      "Vance\u2019s trip extends beyond Paris. Later this week, he will travel to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, where he has said he plans to push European allies to step up their commitments to NATO and Ukraine.",
      "The summit will give some European leaders an introduction to Vance, who is making his first major overseas trip since taking office. He has signaled he will use the summit as a venue for candid discussions on AI policy and broader geopolitical issues.",
      "\u201cAt the AI Summit, the main reason I\u2019m going is actually to have some private conversations with the world leaders who are also going to be there,\u201d Vance told Breitbart News. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot that some of the leaders who are present at the AI summit could do to, frankly \u2014 bring the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a close, help us diplomatically there \u2014 and so we\u2019re going to be focused on those meetings in France.\u201d",
      "Vance is expected to meet separately on Tuesday on the sidelines of the summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, according to a person familiar with planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the yet to be formally announced bilateral meetings.",
      "Vance was joined by his wife Usha and their three children \u2014 Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel \u2014 for the trip to Europe. They were greeted in France on Monday morning by Manuel Valls, the minister for Overseas France, and the U.S. Embassy\u2019s charge d\u2019affaires, David McCawley.",
      "On Tuesday, Vance will have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron, with discussions on Ukraine and the Middle East on the agenda. Vance, like the U.S. president, has questioned U.S. spending on Ukraine and the broader approach to isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump promised to end the fighting within six months of taking office.",
      "Vance also addressed what he views as a concerning trend in Europe regarding free speech, a topic he raised last year at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019ve seen in Europe a really significant, and I think, frankly, an evil trend towards censorship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you hear a lot about America\u2019s moral leadership. One of the things that America\u2019s moral leadership is going to be about during President Trump\u2019s term is free speech. We want people to be able to speak their minds, and we believe that free and open debate is actually a good thing. Unfortunately, a lot of our European friends have gone the wrong direction there.\u201d",
      "Vance is attending Munich again, where he may meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He plans to revisit themes he raised last year, including \u201cto hit on\u201d the need for NATO allies to take on a greater share of responsibility.",
      "Leaders in Europe have been carefully watching Trump\u2019s recent statements on threats to impose tariffs on the European Union, take control of Greenland and his suggestion that Palestinians clear out of Gaza once the fighting in the Israel-Hamas conflict ends \u2014 an idea that\u2019s been flatly rejected by Arab allies.",
      "The summit, which gathers major players such as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, aims at fostering AI advances in sectors like health, education, environment and culture.",
      "A global public-private partnership named \u201cCurrent AI\u201d will be launched to support large-scale initiatives that serve the general interest.",
      "The Paris summit \u201cis the first time we\u2019ll have had such a broad international discussion in one place on the future of AI,\u201d said Linda Griffin, vice president of public policy at Mozilla. \u201cI see it as a norm-setting moment.\u201d",
      "Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, noted an opportunity to shape AI governance in a new direction by \u201cmoving away from this concentration of power amongst a handful of private actors and building this public interest AI instead.\"",
      "However, it remains unclear if the United States will support such initiatives.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complicated questions to resolve\u201d around issues like the ability to control AI systems, Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, founder of Google\u2019s DeepMind research lab, said. \u201cBut also I think even more complicated are maybe the geopolitical questions about things like regulation.\u201d",
      "French organizers are also looking for the summit to ignite major investment announcements in Europe, positioning the region as a viable contender in an industry increasingly shaped by a growing U.S.-China rivalry.",
      "France plans to announce AI private investments worth a total of 109 billion euros ($113 billion) over the coming years, Macron said, presenting it as \u201cthe equivalent\u201d of Trump's Stargate AI data centers project.",
      "On the eve of the AI Summit, Macron posted a series of 'deepfake' videos of himself on Instagram, using artificial intelligence to manipulate his voice and image in various parodies\u2014an effort he said was meant to spark debate on AI\u2019s potential and risks.",
      "In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun expressed opposition Monday to any moves to restrict access to AI tools. The release of DeepSeek has prompted calls in the U.S. Congress to limit its use for security reasons.",
      "\u201cWe oppose drawing ideological lines and oppose overstretching national security concepts and politicizing economic and trade issues,\u201d Guo said.",
      "He said that China advocates for open-source AI technology and promotes the accessibility of AI services to share the benefits of artificial intelligence with all countries.",
      "Modi is co-hosting the summit with Macron in an effort to involve more global actors in AI development and prevent the sector from becoming a U.S.-China battle.",
      "India\u2019s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, stressed the need for equitable access to AI to avoid \"perpetuating a digital divide that is already existing across the world.\u201d",

      "Two rare black wolves have been spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Two rare black wolves, likely siblings, were spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest, a conservation organization said Sunday.",
      "The unusual sighting, captured last year on a video camera set up by SAVE Wildlife Conservation Fund Poland project coordinator Joanna Toczyd\u0142owska, has prompted the organization to collect scat (droppings) in the forest in the hopes of learning more about the black wolves' genetics.",
      "\u201cIt's something new and unusual,\u201d Toczyd\u0142owska told The Associated Press.",
      "Toczyd\u0142owska initially placed the camera to study beavers. When she noticed she was recording wolves instead, she kept the camera there and collected the black wolf footage a few weeks ago.",
      "In one clip, a black wolf and a gray wolf slowly crossed a stream in the forest, the water nearly up to their bellies, before they leap onto the bank. A second clip, taken last fall, records two black wolves and a gray wolf fording the same stream.",
      "Most of the 2,5000 to 3,000 wolves in Poland are gray with red or black accents. Black fur comes from a genetic mutation that was likely in domesticated dogs thousands of years ago. The dark fur is rare in Europe due to a reduced genetic diversity, but at least half of the wolf population has black fur in Yellowstone National Park in the United States.",
      "Because wolves travel in families and both black wolves were around 30 kilograms (66 lbs) \u2014 roughly the size of a German shepherd \u2014 Toczyd\u0142owska said they were likely siblings and roughly a year old. At least one is male.",
      "The conservation organization, which has been monitoring wolves in Poland for 13 years, is not disclosing the forest's location to keep the wolves safe from poaching and prevent misinformation about wolves from spreading.",
      "Wolves were essentially extinct in Poland by the 1950s, but the population has been reintroduced in recent years, especially in central part of the country in the early 2000s. Toczyd\u0142owska and her colleagues teach other the public how to safely live in areas inhabited by wolfpacks.",
      "\u201cFor people, it is a new phenomenon,\u201d Roman Gula, head of the organization's wolf monitoring project, told the AP. \"Education is one of our major, major goals.\"",
      "The conservation fund announced the sighting last week on Facebook and asked for financial support to pay for the scat's genetic testing to learn more about the black-fur mutation.",

      "A New Hampshire man has become the second person known to be living with a pig kidney",
      "A New Hampshire man fought for the chance at a pig kidney transplant, spending months getting into good enough shape to be part of a small pilot study of a highly experimental treatment.",
      "His effort paid off: Tim Andrews, 66, is only the second person known to be living with a pig kidney. Andrews is free from dialysis, Massachusetts General Hospital announced Friday, and recovering so well from the Jan. 25 transplant that he left the hospital a week later.",
      "\u201cWhen I woke up in the recovery room, I was a new man,\u201d Andrews told The Associated Press.",
      "Andrews\u2019 surgery comes at a turning point in the quest to tell if animal-to-human transplants could help ease the shortage of donated human organs. The first four pig organ transplants \u2014 two hearts and two kidneys \u2014 were short-lived. But the fifth xenotransplant recipient, an Alabama woman not nearly as sick as prior patients, boosted the field \u2014 thriving for now 2\u00bd months after a pig kidney transplant at NYU Langone Health in November.",
      "Doctors are moving from those one-off experiments to more formal studies. As they monitor Andrews\u2019 recovery, doctors at Mass General Brigham have Food and Drug Administration permission to perform two additional transplants in their pilot study, using gene-edited pig kidneys supplied by biotech eGenesis.",
      "And United Therapeutics, another developer of gene-edited pig organs, just won FDA approval for the world\u2019s first clinical trial of xenotransplantation. Initially, six patients will receive pig kidneys \u2014 and if they fare well over six months, up to 50 additional patients will receive transplants.",
      "\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d said Mass General\u2019s Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, who led both Andrews\u2019 surgery and the world\u2019s first pig kidney transplant last year. But with lessons from animal research and the prior human attempts, he said, \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic. And hopefully we can get to survival, kidney survival, for over two years.\u201d",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address the transplant shortage. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Andrews\u2019 kidneys abruptly failed about two years ago, and the Concord, New Hampshire, grandfather struggled with fatigue and complications from dialysis. He\u2019s on the transplant list but doctors warned it was a long shot. It can take seven years or more for people with Andrews\u2019 blood type to find a matching kidney. Meanwhile, people slowly get sicker on dialysis \u2014 five-year survival is about 50% \u2014 and Andrews already had had a heart attack.",
      "\u201cI have seen my mortality and I was ready to fight,\u201d Andrews said. So he asked Mass General if he could get a pig kidney instead. \u201cI told them. \u2018Anything, I\u2019ll do anything. You give me a list of things you want me to do and I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mass General transplant nephrologist Dr. Leonardo Riella said Andrews was weak and struggling with diabetes, including a slow-healing diabetic foot ulcer that hindered walking. He\u2019d have to get more fit to be a candidate.",
      "Andrews started physical therapy and returned six months later about 30 pounds lighter and \u201crunning down the hallway almost,\u201d Riella recalled. \u201cHe was just, you know, a different person,\u201d so they started checking if he\u2019d qualify for the pilot study.",
      "One big question was cardiac fitness: Mass General\u2019s first pig kidney recipient had underlying heart disease that killed him. But Riella said intense exams showed Andrews\u2019 \u201cheart was in the best shape possible.\u201d",
      "Still, Andrews was a little nervous and sought advice from the only other person who knew what a pig kidney transplant was like \u2014 the NYU patient, Towana Looney.",
      "\u201cWe just prayed together and talked about how it would be,\u201d Andrews said of their phone calls before and after his transplant. He said Looney advised \u201cto just stay strong and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",
      "Doctors said Andrews' pig kidney turned pink and quickly began producing urine in the operating room, and since then has cleared waste normally with no signs of rejection. Andrews spent the week after his discharge in a nearby Boston hotel for daily checkups but is expected to return home to New Hampshire soon.",
      "NYU transplant surgeon Dr. Robert Montgomery said patients like those in Mass General\u2019s pilot study could be \u201cthe sweet spot\u201d for early xenotransplants \u2014 not yet too sick from years of dialysis but unlikely to survive long enough for a human transplant.",
      "\u201cThose are the patients where it really makes sense for them to try something else,\u201d said Montgomery. His hospital is one of two that will be part of United Therapeutics\u2019 clinical trial later this year, which will include similar patients.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know how Andrews will fare but if the pig kidney were to fail, Riella said he\u2019d still qualify for a human transplant and, now deemed inactive on the transplant list, wouldn\u2019t lose his \u201cwaiting time\u201d that helps determine priority.",
      "Andrews now wants to return to his old dialysis clinic and \u201ctell these people there\u2019s hope, because no hope is not a good thing,\u201d he said.",

      "Mitsotakis visited Santorini a day after the government declared a state of emergency to allow authorities to have faster access to state resources. Despite causing minimal damage, the earthquake activity has prompted an exodus of thousands of residents, tourists and seasonal workers, mostly evacuating to the Greek mainland by ferry. Experts say the seismic activity is unrelated to volcanic activity in the Aegean Sea, but are still unable to say whether the swarm could lead to a more powerful earthquake.",

      "Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.",
      "The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared with the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.",
      "But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates \u201can unusually large, unfavorable impact\u201d from foreign exchange rates, it said.",
      "Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.",
      "Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.",
      "Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.",
      "Sales for Amazon Web services, the company\u2019s prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.",
      "Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.",
      "In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. During a call with analysts on Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said capital expenditures for the quarter came out to $26.3 billion, most of which was geared towards AI and AWS.",
      "\u201cWe think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cI think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.\u201d",
      "Jassy added during the call that Amazon, like many others, was \u201cimpressed\u201d by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.",
      "Amazon's quarterly report comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.",
      "Trump also threw out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.",
      "The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company\u2019s shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon\u2019s answer to Shein and Temu.",
      "Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China."

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian students returned to class this week with a new task: staying away from their smartphones as a new law restricting their use in schools took effect.",
      "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva signed a bill in January limiting smartphone access at schools, in line with a trend seen in the U.S. and Europe. It applies to public and private schools, and applies to classrooms and the halls.",
      "Phones are still allowed for educational purposes, with the teacher\u2019s permission, and when needed for the student's accessibility and health. Schools can set their own guidelines, such as whether students can keep phones in backpacks or store them in lockers or designated baskets.",
      "Before the federal law, most of Brazil's 26 states \u2014 including Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias \u2014 had already applied some restrictions to phone use in schools. As of 2023, nearly two-thirds of Brazilian schools had some limitations, with 28% banning them entirely, according to a survey last year by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "But rules varied between states and between schools, and authorities and administrators struggled with enforcement.",
      "That may have contributed to support for federal legislation from across the political spectrum \u2014 both allies of leftist Lula and the far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents wanted to ban smartphone use by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",
      "Porto Seguro, a nearly 150-year-old private school in Sao Paulo, prohibited smartphones in classrooms last year and encouraged students to disconnect completely once a week. This year, it expanded its ban to include hallways, requiring students to keep their phones in lockers for the entire school day, including breaks.",
      "\u201cStudents were having trouble concentrating,\" school principal Meire Nocito said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThere was also the issue of social isolation. Many students who used technology excessively would isolate themselves during breaks, interacting only through social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cBanning cellphone use has helped create a space for social interaction, fostering relationships and teaching students to navigate conflicts, which are a natural part of human interactions. It has been very positive,\u201d she added.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Education said in a statement Monday that the restriction aims to protect students\u2019 mental and physical health while promoting more rational use of technology.",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, which is among one of the world\u2019s highest rates of use.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",
      "Cell phone bans have gained traction across the United States, where eight states have passed laws or policies that ban or restrict cellphone use to try to curb student phone access and minimize distractions in classrooms.",
      "An increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids jeopardizes their safety and mental health.",
      "A report published in September by the U.N.'s Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO, said one in four countries has already restricted the use of such devices at schools.",
      "Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized used a U.S. Senate hearing last year to apologize to parents of children exploited, bullied or driven to self harm via social media. He also noted Meta\u2019s continued investments in \u201cindustrywide\u201d efforts to protect children.",
      "Mariana Waetge, a 13-year-old student at Porto Seguro, has owned a smartphone for five years. She uses it to communicate with friends and family and to find entertainment on social media, especially Instagram. Being forced to stay away from her phone made her find new ways to interact with friends, improved her focus and even strengthened her relationship with her family.",
      "The restriction also helped \"include people who didn\u2019t have many friends and would use their phones to hide from making new friends or to avoid being out there,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cNow they don\u2019t have that option anymore.

      "Lawmakers in the House are proposing to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from U.S. government devices",
      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan duo in the the U.S. House is proposing legislation to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from federal devices, similar to the policy already in place for the popular social media platform TikTok.",
      "Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Darin LaHood, R-Ill., on Thursday introduced the \u201cNo DeepSeek on Government Devices Act,\" which would ban federal employees from using the Chinese AI app on government-owned electronics. They cited the Chinese government's ability to use the app for surveillance and misinformation as reasons to keep it away from federal networks.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans,\" Gottheimer said in a statement. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t risk the CCP infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing our national security.\"",
      "The proposal comes after the Chinese software company in January published an AI model that performed at a competitive level with models developed by American firms like OpenAI, Meta, Alphabet and others. DeepSeek purported to develop the model at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts. The announcement raised alarm bells and prompted debates among policymakers and leading Silicon Valley financiers and technologists.",
      "The churn over AI is coming at a moment of heightened competition between the U.S. and China in a range of areas, including technological innovation. The U.S. has levied tariffs on Chinese goods, restricted Chinese tech firms like Huawei from being used in government systems and banned the export of state of the art microchips thought to be needed to develop the highest end AI models.",
      "Last year, Congress and then-President Joe Biden approved a divestment of the popular social media platform TikTok from its Chinese parent company or face a ban across the U.S.; that policy is now on hold. President Donald Trump, who originally proposed a ban of the app in his first term, signed an executive order last month extending a window for a long term solution before the legally required ban takes effect.",
      "In 2023, Biden banned TikTok from federal-issued devices.",
      "\u201cThe technology race with the Chinese Communist Party is not one the United States can afford to lose,\u201d LaHood said in a statement. \u201cThis commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation will ban the app from federal workers\u2019 phones while closing backdoor operations the company seeks to exploit for access. It is critical that Congress safeguard Americans\u2019 data and continue to ensure American leadership in AI.\u201d",
      "The bill would single out DeepSeek and any AI application developed by its parent company, the hedge fund High-Flyer, as subject to the ban. The legislation includes exceptions for national security and research purposes that would allow federal employers to study DeepSeek.",
      "Some lawmakers wish to go further. A bill proposed last week by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., would bar the import of export of any AI technology from China writ large, citing national security concerns."

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists say they've cracked the code for boiling the perfect egg.",
      "It's a recipe you can test for yourself \u2014 though the timing isn't ideal with soaring egg prices in the United States from a bird flu outbreak.",
      "The perfect boiled egg has a velvety yolk paired with a soft, solid white.",
      "Achieving this balance can be a challenge because the yolk cooks at a lower temperature than the white. Hard boiling an egg can yield a chalky yolk, while cooking low and slow can produce jelly-like, undercooked whites.",
      "Researchers cooked hundreds of eggs and used math to tackle this runny conundrum. One equation dealt with how heat travels between a hot surface and an egg; another captured how the egg's contents morph from liquid to solid with a gel-like state in between.",
      "Their final recipe involves transferring eggs in a steamer basket every two minutes between two bowls of water \u2014 one boiling and the other lukewarm at 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) \u2014 for a total of 32 minutes before cooling under running water and peeling.",

      "In the method proposed by the researchers, dubbed periodic cooking, the egg whites heated and cooled until fully set. The yolk, on the other hand, held firm at a constant temperature and cooked until creamy.",

      "To confirm they had cooked up something new, the researchers tested the chemical makeup of the prepared eggs and served them to a panel of eight tasters alongside traditional boiled eggs.",
      "The research was published Thursday in the journal Communications Engineering.",
      "This new technique could mean more time in the kitchen compared to a standard hard-boiled egg, said food scientist Joanne Slavin from the University of Minnesota. But the blend of textures on the tongue could be worth the extra time.",
      "\u201cThis is a slower process to get a better outcome,\u201d said Slavin, who had no role in the study.",

      "Greece has declared a state of emergency on Santorini because of the hundreds of undersea earthquakes that have shaken the resort island for nearly a week",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Greece\u2019s government declared a state of emergency on Santorini on Thursday after hundreds of undersea earthquakes shook the resort island for nearly a week.",
      "The ministry of civil protection\u2019s announcement will provide authorities faster access to state resources. It follows a magnitude 5.2 tremor \u2013- the most powerful recorded since activity started on Jan. 31 \u2013- that struck late Wednesday.",
      "Government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis confirmed that multiple emergency services were already mobilized to support the island.",
      "\u201cFire departments, police, coast guard, armed forces, and emergency medical services have immediately reinforced Santorini and surrounding islands with additional personnel and specialized equipment,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Despite causing minimal damage, the earthquake activity has prompted an exodus of thousands of residents and seasonal workers, mostly evacuating to the Greek mainland by ferry.",
      "Experts say the seismic activity is unrelated to volcanic activity in the Aegean Sea, but are still unable to say whether the swarm could lead up to a more powerful earthquake.",
      "\u201cWe are not yet in a position to say that we are seeing any evidence that would lead to the sequence slowly coming to a conclusion,\u201d Vassilis K. Karastathis, a seismologist and director of research at National Observatory of Athens, told reporters. \u201cWe are still in the middle of the road, we haven\u2019t seen any easing, any sign that it\u2019s heading towards a regression.\u201d",
      "The earthquake epicenters are concentrated in a growing cluster between the islands of Santorini, Anafi, Amorgos, and Ios. Experts view the underwater location as a mitigating factor, noting that it significantly reduces the potential for widespread damage compared to land-based seismic events.",
      "On Santorini, municipal crews cordoned off some areas on the island\u2019s renowned cliff top towns that were considered vulnerable to potential rock slides. Crews of engineers also inspected school buildings that have remained closed all week.",
      "The island\u2019s Orthodox church has urged residents to assist each other during a time of \u201cgreat anxiety.\u201d",
      "\u201cIsland life, intensely communal, has taught us to be close to one another \u2013 in the happy, the sad and the difficult times,\u201d the Metropolitan Bishop Amphilochios of Thira, Amorgos and Isles, said in an online message.",
      "\u201cThis is how we will face the present condition while it lasts,\" he added. \"And by God\u2019s grace we will strengthen ourselves on the path of progress and creation for the good of our islands and their blessed inhabitants, our brothers and sisters.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Smartphones are useful tools for everyday life but they\u2019re privy to nearly everything about you, including all the places you\u2019ve been",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones are useful tools for everyday life, but they're privy to nearly everything about you, including all the places you've been \u2014 if you let them.",
      "When you use a map app to find the new restaurant your friend recommended, or your phone's browser to check the price of something you saw while window shopping, you could be unwittingly allowing your phone to track your location and share that information with others.",
      "Phones use various signals to find your location, including cell tower pings, Wi-Fi access points, Bluetooth and GPS.",
      "Sometimes your phone needs to know your location to provide a useful service, like telling the Uber driver where to pick you up. But in other cases, there\u2019s little justification for tracking your whereabouts, which then can be exploited by apps, ad services or even hackers.",
      "\u201cFrom fitness tracking to navigation, every location ping potentially reveals details about our routines and movements \u2013 which could be risky in the wrong hands,\" said Darren Guccione, CEO of Keeper Security. \u201cUsers should turn on location tracking only when necessary, such as during navigation, emergencies or sharing updates with trusted contacts, and disable it immediately afterward.\"",
      "Experts warn location data could be used to track people who visit abortion clinics. Or \"a disgruntled ex could use location sharing to stalk someone, or a current, abusive partner could force you into location sharing as a means of control,\u201d said David Ruiz, senior privacy advocate at cybersecurity company Malwarebytes.",
      "Here are some tips to make sure location tracking is kept to a minimum:",
      "Head to your phone's control panel to check permissions.",
      "iPhone users can go to the Privacy & Security tab, and then to Location Services to check settings for individual apps. It's not a good idea to let apps always use your location in the background, according to cybersecurity experts. Instead, get the app to either ask first before using your location, use it only while you've got the app open, or even never let it use your location.",
      "While you're in Location Services, you might notice little arrows that indicate which apps have used your location. Purple means recently, while grey indicates the past 24 hours.",
      "It's a little different for Android phones because there are so many different versions by various device manufacturers. In general, go to settings, and then tap the Location icon, which lets you turn it on or off for all apps.",
      "To tweak settings for individual apps, tap App location permissions, where you'll get choices similar to those in iOS.",
      "Apple has other tools to cut down on third-party tracking that might include location information. On the iPhone's Privacy & Security setting, under the Tracking tab, there's a toggle to Allow Apps to Request to Track. With this switched off, any new app requests will be automatically denied and they will also be stopped from accessing your phone's ad identifier.",
      "Privacy experts recommend blocking your Google or Apple device\u2019s in-house ad identifier, which enables third-party tracking on most devices for better ad targeting.",
      "On iPhones, go to the Privacy setting then scroll down to Apple Advertising, and then switch off Personalized Ads. On newer Android phones, go to the Privacy setting, then to Ads, where you can tap Delete Advertising ID.",
      "Whether you use Android or iOS, they both have settings to allow precisely pinpointing your location by combining wireless signals with data from onboard sensors such as the gyroscope, accelerometer and barometer. This helps to estimate the phone's position if, for example, you're inside a building blocking a GPS signal.",
      "One reason to use this function is to show someone you're meeting exactly where you are. Google says its signals are randomized so they can\u2019t be associated with a specific person or account. In any case, you might not want every app to know this, so you can tell your phone to only share its general location.",
      "On Android phones, turn off the Location Accuracy setting for all apps. On iPhones, switch it on or off for individual apps.",
      "Along with app permissions for your device, it's also a good idea to check your Google account. Google was forced to be more transparent about its location tracking practices after a 2018 Associated Press story that found the company continued to track people\u2019s location data even after they opted out of such tracking by disabling a feature the company called \u201clocation history.\u201d",
      "Go to myaccount.google.com and then to the Data & Privacy section, where you'll find the Location History controls. Under recent changes, the history will be deleted after three months, though you can change that default setting.",
      "Popular smartphone web browsers like Safari or Chrome could give away your location, so try using one that that doesn't store information about you, like DuckDuckGo, Firefox Focus or Ecosia.",
      "If a privacy-focused browser needs to access your location through your IP address, they will ask first. It will also let you easily delete your cookies and other web browsing data.",
      "Phones or tablets can also be tracked with Apple's Find My or Google's Find My Device features for recovering lost devices. You can turn this feature off if you think someone has gained access to your Apple or Google account.",
      "Some cybersecurity websites recommend using airplane mode, but it doesn\u2019t always shut off all signals so you shouldn't rely on it.",
      "A signal-blocking Faraday pouch would be a better bet, but be sure to test it to make sure it's actually jamming all signals. And, keep in mind, you'll need to take the device out of the bag to use it.",
      "There are so many possible ways for smartphones \u2014 and other devices like smartwatches \u2014 to track our location that it's hard to provide an exhaustive checklist.",
      "Our default relationship with apps, companies, and platforms is for them to track us, \"which absolutely makes it harder for us to scrutinize all the channels through which our data is being sent,\" said Ruiz.",
      "\u201cThe unfortunate truth is that, to shut everything down, we have to go into our device settings and check each app, line by line, and make individual decisions for how those apps collect our location data,\" said Ruiz. \u201cIt\u2019s either that, or turn off all location data entirely,\" which could result in inconveniences like having to manually enter your address on ride-hailing apps, or not getting live directions from mapping apps, he said.",

      "U.K. scientists say they have made a historic breakthrough by making the first image of the inside of a scroll carbonized by a volcanic eruption 2,000 years ago",
      "LONDON -- Scientists hope a mix of artificial intelligence and human expertise will help decipher ancient scrolls carbonized by a volcanic eruption 2,000 years ago.",
      "Hundreds of papyrus scrolls were found in the 1750s in the remains of a lavish villa at the Roman town of Herculaneum, which along with neighboring Pompeii was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79.",
      "The library of what\u2019s called the Villa of the Papyri has the potential to add immeasurably to knowledge of ancient thought if the scrolls, which have been rolled up into the size of a candy bar, could be read.",
      "The heat and volcanic ash from Vesuvius destroyed the town and preserved the scrolls, but in an unreadable state, turning them into charred fragile blocks that disintegrate if unrolled physically.",
      "Scholars and scientists have worked for more than 250 years on ways to decipher the scrolls, the vast majority of which are held in the National Library of Naples.",
      "In 2023, several tech executives sponsored the \u201cVesuvius Challenge\u201d competition, offering cash rewards for efforts to decipher the scrolls with machine learning, computer vision and geometry.",
      "On Wednesday, the challenge announced a \u201chistoric breakthrough,\u201d saying researchers had managed to generate the first image of the inside of one of the three scrolls held at Oxford University\u2019s Bodleian Library.",
      "University of Kentucky computer scientist Brent Seales, co-founder of the Vesuvius Challenge, said the organizers were \u201cthrilled with the successful imaging of this scroll.\u201d He said it \u201ccontains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll.\u201d",
      "The scroll was scanned by Diamond Light Source, a lab at Harwell, near Oxford, that uses a particle accelerator known as a synchrotron to create an intensely powerful X-ray.",
      "Scientists then used AI to piece together the images, search for ink that reveals where there is writing, and enhance the clarity of the text. The process led to a 3D image of the scroll that allowed experts to unroll it virtually, using a process called segmentation.",
      "AI, as it stands, has its limits. Little of the text has been deciphered so far. One of the few words that has been made out is the ancient Greek for \u201cdisgust.\u201d",
      "Scholars are being encouraged to join in the effort to complete the text.",
      "\u201cWe are still at the beginning of a long process,\u201d Peter Toth, the Cornelia Starks Curator of Greek Collections at the Bodleian, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe need better images, and they are very positive and very, very confident that they can still improve the image quality and the legibility of the text.\u201d",
      "Toth also laid out his hope that the technology can be made available locally so that the other two fragile scrolls won't have to be transported to Diamond\u2019s headquarters.",
      "\u201cMaybe there will be something which can be moved,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then don\u2019t forget that there is like 1000 more scrolls in Naples.\u201d",

      "In a court filing Monday night, Justice Department lawyers acknowledged making two significant errors last week during a court hearing about the dismantling of the foreign aid agency USAID. While DOJ attorneys last week claimed that 500 employees at USAID had been put on leave and that only future contracts had been put on pause, more than 2,100 employees had actually been placed on leave while both future and existing contracts were frozen, according to the filing.",
      "\"Defendants sincerely regret these inadvertent misstatements based on information provided to counsel immediately prior to the hearing and have made every effort to provide reliable information in the declaration supporting their opposition to a preliminary injunction,\" DOJ lawyers wrote to the judge overseeing the case.",
      "During the USAID hearing last week, Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, expressed frustration that the government had not provided him sufficient information.",
      "\"I need to know what the government's official position is right now. What is happening?\" Nichols said. \"Is the government paying people or not?\"",
      "The Trump administration has faced a torrent of lawsuits over the last two weeks, with judges over the last two days blocking them from enforcing a federal buyout program, cutting funding for health research, and removing public health data from government websites.",
      "After a New York judge blocked Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury Department records on Saturday, both DOGE head Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance began to publicly float the idea of defying the court orders.",
      "Justice Department representatives did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "During a hearing in the Treasury Department case, the DOJ claimed that Marko Elez -- a SpaceX employee-turned-DOGE cost-cutter who briefly resigned last week after the Wall Street Journal reported on racist social media posts -- was a \"special government employee\" within the Department of the Treasury.",
      "In a filing Monday, the DOJ corrected themselves to note that Elez was actually a full-fledged Treasury Department employee -- a \"Special Advisor for Information Technology and Modernization\" according to the filing -- who is subject to additional ethics requirements.",
      "During a hearing last week on whether the DOJ should be blocked from disseminating a list of federal agents and employees who worked on cases involving the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, a DOJ attorney was unable to say with confidence whether the government might eventually release the list, frustrating the judge overseeing the case.",
      "\"You represent the government,\" U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb said sternly. \"The White House wants this information. Does the government have present intent to publicly release names of FBI agents that worked on Jan. 6 cases?\"",
      "\"People who have the list don't have present intent,\" replied the attorney, Jeremy Simon, who then had to ask for a series of short recesses as he was pressed to provide answers on the government's stance.",
      "At one point Simon needed to excuse himself into the hallway to speak by phone with his superiors.",
      "The legal challenges began immediately after Trump ignited his barrage of Day-1 executive orders. During a hearing on the administration's short-lived federal funding freeze, a DOJ attorney appeared unable to provide a clear answer about the extent of the White House's new policy.",
      "\"It seems like the federal government currently doesn't actually know the full scope of the programs that are going to be subject to the pause. Is that correct?\" U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan asked the attorney.",
      "\"I can only speak for myself, which is just based on the limited time frame here, that I do not have a comprehensive list,\" replied DOJ lawyer Daniel Schwei. \"It just depends.\"",
      "And during the first court hearing about Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, the position of defending Trump's order put Brett Shumate, the acting assistant attorney general for the DOJ's civil division, in a federal judge's firing line.",
      "\"In your opinion, is this executive order constitutional?\" U.S. District Judge John Coughenour asked Shumate during the hearing.",
      "\"Yes, we think it is,\" Shumate said, drawing the judge's rebuke.",
      "\"I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar can state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It boggles my mind,\" Coughenour said. \"Where were the lawyers when this decision was being made?\"",
      "A constitutional law expert told ABC News that DOJ attorneys have been rebuked by judges of all stripes.",
      "\"They are doing this regardless of geography and regardless of who appointed them,\" said Loyola Marymount University law professor Justin Levitt. \"So you've seen pushback from Reagan appointees, you've seen pushback from Bush appointees, you've seen pushback from Obama appointees and Trump appointees and Biden appointees, and that's going to continue.\"",
      "Levitt said the results have generally not been in the Trump administration's favor.",
      "\"As far as I can tell, they're winless in the courts,\" he said.",

      "It comes as Jordan's King Abdullah visited the White House on Tuesday.",
      "The Trump administration is gearing up for potentially contentious meetings with Arab power players this week as President Donald Trump continues to press his plan for what he calls U.S. \"ownership\" of Gaza, going so far as to threaten cutting off U.S. aid to Jordan and Egypt if they don't go along.",
      "On Tuesday, Jordan's King Abdullah arrived to meet with Trump at the White House, becoming the first Arab leader to do since he returned to power last month.",
      "As Trump welcomed him to the White House, ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce asked him if he's confident he can get the king to back his plan for the Palestinian people, Trump pointed to him and said, \"he's a good man.\"",
      "When asked repeatedly if he will cut off aid to Jordan, as he suggested he might Monday night if the king doesn't get on board and agree to take in Palestinians, Trump refused to comment.",
      "Jordan has served as a humanitarian lifeline for civilians in Gaza throughout the Israel-Hamas conflict and already hosts millions of registered Palestinian refugees.",
      "But Trump's plan for rebuilding Gaza calls for the country, as well as Egypt, to take in close to 2 million more Palestinians he says can be removed from Gaza so that the war-torn land can be transformed into what he calls \"the Riviera of the Middle East\" under his watch.",
      "Trump's proposal to \"clean out\" Gaza has ignited a sharp wave of backlash from Middle Eastern leaders, including from Abdullah.",
      "\"His Majesty King Abdullah II stresses the need to put a stop to (Israeli) settlement expansion, expressing rejection of any attempts to annex land and displace the Palestinians,\" the Jordanian royal court said in a statement posted to X on Wednesday, in the wake of Trump's stunning announcement last week.",
      "In the days since, Abdullah has also engaged in a flurry of calls and meetings with the U.N. and other countries that have historically supported the creation of a Palestinian homeland -- a possible effort to present a united front aimed at pushing back against Trump's designs for Gaza.",
      "But the opposition appears to have done little to deter Trump. In a clip from his weekend interview with Fox News released on Monday, Trump said that under his scheme, Palestinians removed from Gaza would not have the right to return to the land after reconstruction was completed.",
      "\"No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing, much better,\" he said. \"I'm talking about building a permanent place for them.\"",
      "The president has also brushed off opposition from Jordan and Egypt to taking in large numbers of Palestinians, suggesting he would pressure their governments to get on board.",
      "\"If they don't agree, I would conceivably withhold aid,\" he told reporters Monday night.",
      "Trump is also dispatching his top diplomat, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, to the Middle East at the end of this week.",
      "Rubio is slated to visit Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. He also met with the Egypt's foreign minister at the State Department on Monday. However, it's unclear whether he is on the same page as the president.",
      "During his tour through Central America last week, Rubio was asked multiple times if Palestinians would be allowed to return to Gaza post-reconstruction under Trump's plan; on each occasion, the secretary did not fully answer the question, but said Gazans would have to live somewhere else \"in the interim.\"",
      "Asked how Rubio would resolve similar concerns raised by Arab leader's during his tour through the Middle East, a senior State Department official replied \"I don't know what his plans are. I'm not a mind-reader.\"",
      "In a radio interview broadcast on Monday, the secretary said he would be the one putting questions to Middle Eastern officials --asking them how they aim to resolve the conflict.",
      "\"The only one who's stood up and said I'm willing to help do it is Donald Trump. All these other leaders, they're going to have to step up. If they've got a better idea, then now is the time,\" Rubio said.",
      "However, the foreign ministers from the Arab countries Rubio will visit already sent a letter to him earlier this month detailing their willingness to work with the Trump administration on a two-state solution, which the secretary has all but dismissed.",
      "Some analysts have characterized Trump's proposal for Gaza as a negotiating ploy. If that's the case, Ahmed Aboudouh, an associate fellow at Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa Programme, argues it has already done more harm than good.",
      "\"If Trump's eye-popping intervention was a bargaining tactic, as some searching for logic in the proposal claim, it has already failed. Enormous damage has been done to the fragile peace process and US prestige,\" Aboudouh said.",
      "Others, like Thomas S. Warrick -- a nonresident senior fellow at the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative and former Department of Homeland Security official -- see some value in Trump's proposal.",
      "\"No one predicted that Trump would push the United States to engage more on what postwar Gaza should look like in one month than the Biden team did in fifteen months,\" Warrick said.",
      "However, Warrick said Trump's strategy \"will need to be dialed back to what is workable,\" and that he's likely to come face to face with one tall hurdle when he meets with Abdullah: Jordan's unwillingness to accept Palestinian refugees from Gaza.",
      "\"There is quite literally no tool in the US toolbox that could persuade the leaders of Egypt or Jordan to change their minds on this point,\" he said. \"Trump's advisors know this, but they would likely rather have Trump hear this directly from Jordanian King Abdullah.\"",

      "Trump this week announced 25% tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum.",
      "Refrigerators, beers and bicycles stand at risk of higher prices as a result of tariffs on steel and aluminum announced by President Donald Trump this week, experts told ABC News.",
      "The tariffs, which take effect next month, slap a 25% tax on all foreign steel and aluminum, repeating a policy Trump initiated during his first term in office.",
      "Trade experts told ABC News the tariffs will likely raise prices for some goods made out of the two metals, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to retailers and, in turn, down the line to consumers.",
      "\"This will feed through the economy,\" Kyle Handley, a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, told ABC News. Higher prices could manifest in as little as three months or as long as a year, Handley added.",
      "In response to ABC News' request for comment, the White House said the policy would boost economic performance.",
      "\"In his first administration, President Trump instituted an America First economic agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation and an unleashing of American energy that resulted in historic job, wage and investment growth with no inflation. In his second administration, President Trump will again use tariffs to level the playing field and usher in a new era of growth and prosperity for American industry and workers,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.",
      "Here are the prices that may increase as a result of tariffs on steel and aluminum:",
      "Cars and trucks",
      "Steel is the top material by weight in a car, accounting for about 60% of its weight, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.",
      "Once steel imports face stiff taxes, experts forecast the price of steel paid by U.S. manufacturers will rise, meaning higher input costs for carmakers. Those companies, they added, are likely to hike prices for consumers as a means of offsetting some of those costs.",
      "\"There's a lot of metal in a Ford truck,\" Handley said. \"If it's more expensive, they'll have to charge more for the car.\"",
      "Ford declined to respond to ABC News' request for comment. Speaking on Tuesday at the Wolfe Research conference, an investor gathering, Ford CEO Jim Farley said potential tariffs on steel and aluminum are causing \"cost and chaos,\" according to a transcript of the event shared by Ford.",
      "Bill Hanvey, president and CEO of Auto Care Association, a trade group representing thousands of firms across the vehicle supply chain, criticized the steel tariffs.",
      "\"Many specialty steel products used in our industry are not readily available from domestic sources, making access to global supply chains essential,\" Hanvey said in a statement.",
      "Soda and beer",
      "Aluminum tariffs risk higher prices for beverages packaged in aluminum cans, such as beer and soft drinks, some experts said.",
      "The previous set of tariffs on aluminum cost the U.S. beverage industry $1.7 billion between 2018 and 2022, according to the Beer Institute, an industry trade group.",
      "\"Paying a tariff-laden price on all aluminum drives up the cost of doing business and makes consumer goods more expensive,\" the Beer Institute said in 2022.",
      "In response to the tariffs imposed by Trump this week, the Illinois Craft Brewers Guild warned on X: \"Our small brewery owners and customers will pay the price.\"",
      "Some soda companies may also feel the pinch. Speaking on an earnings call on Tuesday, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said the company may focus on a different packaging material if aluminum prices rise.",
      "Home appliances",
      "Major home appliances -- such as refrigerators and washing machines -- rely in part on steel, making them vulnerable to potential price increases, Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told ABC News.",
      "\"You would certainly expect to see those goods get a little bit more expensive,\" Miller said.",
      "In the aftermath of steel and aluminum tariffs during Trump's first term, major appliances showed price increases of between 5% and 10% between June 2018 and April 2019, Miller added, citing a monthly government data release. Those price hikes far outpaced an overall inflation rate of around 2%.",
      "Though prices for major appliances started to decline in the latter part of 2019, Miller noted, forecasting at the very least a halt in the price drops.",
      "Bicycles",
      "Steel and aluminum make up a key component of bicycles, raising the likelihood of price increases, Handley said.",
      "\"Bicycles will definitely be more expensive,\" Handley said, pointing to the aluminum used for bicycle frames and components. In some cases, he added, those raw materials depend on steel.",

      "The Trump administration and its opponents have gone back and forth in court.",
      "A federal appeals court denied the Trump administration's request to lift a lower court's order that blocked the president from unilaterally freezing billions in funding in loans, grants and financial assistance.",
      "Three weeks into President Donald Trump's presidency, Tuesday's decision marks the first time a federal appeals court has taken up a challenge by the Trump administration, with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declining to grant the president's request. The decision came down at nearly the same time Trump told ABC News' Rachel Scott that he would \"always abide by the courts.\"",
      "In a two-page order, a panel of three judges on the 1st Circuit denied Trump's request for an administrative stay of the lower court's temporary restraining order, deferring to the district court to issue clarification about its earlier order.",
      "\"We are confident the District Court will act with dispatch to provide any clarification needed with respect to, among other things, the defendants' contention that the February 10 Order 'bars both the President and much of the Federal Government from exercising their own lawful authorities to withhold funding without the prior approval of the district court,'\" they said in the order.",
      "Each of the three judges who made the decision were nominated to the bench by Democratic presidents.",
      "In making the decision, they noted that lawyers for the Department of Justice did \"not cite any authority in support of their administrative stay\" or articulate they suffered from the lower court's order.",
      "\"This Circuit has not addressed whether or when an administrative stay of the sort being requested here may be issued, and there is well-recognized uncertainty as to what standards guide the decision to issue one or not,\" the judges added.",
      "The court will consider issuing a stay pending appeal later this week, according to the order. The Trump administration had asked for an immediate administrative pause, which was rejected, as well as a stay pending appeal by Friday.",
      "The order follows the Trump administration reigniting the legal fight over whether it could unilaterally freeze the funding.",
      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice had asked the Boston-based 1st Circuit to stay a decision by a federal judge in Rhode Island who determined that the Trump administration likely violated the Constitution when it tried to block trillions in federal funding through a now-rescinded directive of the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "That Rhode Island judge on Monday issued an order finding that the Trump administration, in its effort to \"root out fraud,\" was still cutting off funding in defiance of the court order. DOJ lawyers then argued the district court was overstepping its ability to rein in the power of the president.",
      "\"This appeal arises from an extraordinary and unprecedented assertion of power by a single district court judge to superintend and control the Executive Branch's spending of federal funds, in clear violation of the Constitution's separation of powers,\" they wrote in an emergency application to the 1st Circuit.",
      "DOJ attorneys argued the court's decision effectively requires the federal government to get \"preclearance\" from the district court for any decision relating to funding.",
      "\"It is self-evidently unworkable for the defendant agencies to be required to seek targeted relief from the district court every time they wish to withhold funds based on their own authorities,\" they said in the filing.",
      "Lawyers representing the 23 state attorneys general are aggressively pushing back on the appeal, arguing that allowing the funding freeze will irreparably harm millions of people who rely on federal money.",
      "\"This case challenges defendants' implementation of a policy imposing across-the-board blanket freezes on payments to all recipients of federal funding associated with nearly all federal programs across the Nation, ranging from (for example) healthcare funding to education funding to critical energy and infrastructure grants -- a policy that had severe and destabilizing consequences for Plaintiff States and their residents,\" they said in the lawsuit.",
      "The attorneys general also argued it is procedurally improper for the Trump administration to appeal a temporary restraining order, which generally can't be stayed.",
      "\"If the Court were to issue an administrative stay, defendants would immediately be free to resume this sweeping and illegal policy, harming Plaintiff States and the many recipients of federal funding that reside within their jurisdictions,\" they said.",

      "AVAC said in the suit that it has already had to lay off several members of its staff, which threatens to cripple its ability to operate even if its funding return.",
      "\"So when Defendants promise to 'decide to continue [some] program[s] in the same or modified form' \u2026 it is clear they have not grappled with the reality that those programs may not be able to be revived,\" the suit claimed.",
      "Both suits cited the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which makes it difficult for a president to try to avoid spending money allocated by the legislative branch. Both suits requested the courts intervene to reinstate the federal funding and issue temporary restraining orders on Trump's foreign aid freeze.",

      "More than two-dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans have filed a federal court lawsuit challenging a Trump administration move giving immigration agents more leeway to make arrests at houses of worship",
      "More than two-dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans \u2014 ranging from the Episcopal Church and the Union for Reform Judaism to the Mennonites and Unitarian Universalists \u2014 filed a federal court lawsuit Tuesday challenging a Trump administration move giving immigration agents more leeway to make arrests at houses of worship.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, contends that the new policy is spreading fear of raids, thus lowering attendance at worship services and other valuable church programs. The result, says the suit, infringes on the groups\u2019 religious freedom \u2014 namely their ability to minister to migrants, including those in the United States illegally.",
      "\u201cWe have immigrants, refugees, people who are documented and undocumented,\u201d said the Most Rev. Sean Rowe, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.",
      "\u201cWe cannot worship freely if some of us are living in fear,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cBy joining this lawsuit, we\u2019re seeking the ability to gather and fully practice our faith, to follow Jesus\u2019 command to love our neighbors as ourselves.\u201d",
      "The new lawsuit echoes and expands on some of the arguments made in a similar lawsuit filed Jan. 27 by five Quaker congregations and later joined by the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and a Sikh temple. It is currently pending in U.S. District Court in Maryland.",
      "There was no immediate Trump administration response to the new lawsuit, which names the Department of Homeland Security and its immigration enforcement agencies as defendants. However, a memorandum filed Friday by the Department of Justice, opposing the thrust of the Quaker lawsuit, outlined arguments that may also apply to the new lawsuit.",
      "In essence, the memo contended that the plaintiffs\u2019 request to block the new enforcement policy is based on speculation of hypothetical future harm \u2014 and thus is insufficient grounds for issuing an injunction.",
      "The memo said that immigration enforcement affecting houses of worship had been permitted for decades, and the new policy announced in January simply said that field agents \u2014 using \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cdiscretion\u201d \u2014 could now conduct such operations without pre-approval from a supervisor.",
      "One part of that memo might not apply to the new lawsuit, as it argued the Quakers and their fellow plaintiffs have no basis for seeking a nationwide injunction against the revised enforcement policy.",
      "\u201cAny relief in this case should be tailored solely to the named plaintiffs,\u201d said the DOJ memo, contending that any injunction should not apply to other religious organizations.",
      "The plaintiffs in the new lawsuit represent a vastly larger swath of American worshippers \u2014 including more than 1 million followers of Reform Judaism, the estimated 1.5 million Episcopalians in 6,700 congregations nationwide, nearly 1.1 million members of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and the estimated 1.5 million active members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church \u2014 the country\u2019s oldest predominantly Black denomination.",
      "Among the other plaintiffs are the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), with more than 3,000 congregations; the Church of the Brethren, with more than 780 congregations; the Convenci\u00f3n Bautista Hispana de Texas, encompassing about 1,100 Hispanic Baptist churches; the Friends General Conference, an association of regional Quaker organizations; the Mennonite Church USA, with about 50,000 members; the Unitarian Universalist Association, with more than 1,000 congregations; the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, with more than 500 U.S. congregations; and regional branches of the United Methodist Church and the United Church of Christ.",
      "\u201cThe massive scale of the suit will be hard for them to ignore,\u201d said Kelsi Corkran, a lawyer with the Georgetown University Law Center\u2019s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection who is lead counsel for the lawsuit.",
      "The plaintiffs joined the suit, she said, \u201cbecause their scripture, teaching, and traditions offer irrefutable unanimity on their religious obligation to embrace and serve the refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants in their midst without regard to documentation or legal status.\u201d",
      "Prior to the recent Trump administration change, Corkran said immigration agents generally needed a judicial warrant or other special authorization to conduct operations at houses of worship and other \u201csensitive locations\" such as schools and hospitals.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s go anywhere, any time,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cNow they have broad authority to swoop in \u2014 they\u2019ve made it very clear they\u2019ll get every undocumented person.\u201d",
      "She cited a recent incident in which a Honduran man was arrested outside his family\u2019s Atlanta-area church while a service was being held inside.",
      "The lawsuit includes details from some of the plaintiffs as to how their operations might be affected. The Union for Reform Judaism and the Mennonites, among others, said many of their synagogues and churches host on-site foodbanks, meal programs, homeless shelters and other support services for undocumented people who might now be fearful of participating.",
      "One of the plaintiffs is the Latino Christian National Network, which seeks to bring together Latino leaders with different traditions and values to collaborate on pressing social issues. The network\u2019s president is the Rev. Carlos Malav\u00e9, a pastor of two churches in Virginia, who described to the AP what network members are observing.",
      "\u201cThere is deep-seated fear and distrust of our government,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople fear going to the store, they are avoiding going to church. ... The churches are increasingly doing online services because people fear for the well-being of their families.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which leads the nation's largest denomination, did not join the lawsuit, though it has criticized Trump's migration crackdown. On Tuesday, Pope Francis issued a major rebuke of the deportation plan, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity and \u201cwill end badly.\u201d",
      "Many conservative faith leaders and legal experts across the U.S. do not share concerns about the new arrest policy.",
      "\u201cPlaces of worship are for worship and are not sanctuaries for illegal activity or for harboring people engaged in illegal activity,\u201d said Mat Staver, founder of the conservative Christian legal organization Liberty Counsel.",
      "\u201cFugitives or criminals are not immune from the law merely because they enter a place of worship,\u201d he said via email. \u201cThis is not a matter of religious freedom. There is no right to openly violate the law and disobey law enforcement.\u201d",
      "Professor Cathleen Kaveny, who teaches in the theology department and law school at Boston College, questioned whether the plaintiffs would prevail with the religious freedom argument, but suggested the Trump administration might be unwise to disregard a traditional view of houses of worship as places of sanctuary for vulnerable people.",
      "\u201cThese buildings are different \u2014 almost like embassies,\u201d she said. \u201cI think of churches as belonging to an eternal country.\u201d",

    "summary": "Judge Beryl Howell issued a memorandum opinion on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Judge Beryl Howell issued a memorandum opinion on Monday.",
      "A federal judge has ordered that the FBI must release some records related to its investigation of President Donald Trump's handling of presidential records that have been sought under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).",
      "In a memorandum opinion issued Monday, Judge Beryl Howell wrote, \"Given the current circumstances and legal landscape\u2014including that President Trump now enjoys absolute and presumptive immunity from criminal liability, the government has dismissed criminal charges against President Trump and ... and no pending or even contemplated criminal enforcement action within the applicable statute of limitations on the topics of responsive records is at all likely,\" the exemptions the FBI cited to block the release of information no longer apply.",
      "Exactly three years ago, on Feb. 10, 2022, Axios reported that New York Times correspondent Maggie Haberman's then-upcoming book, \"Confidence Man,\" included a claim that White House staff \"periodically discovered wads of printed paper clogging\" the presidential toilet.",
      "Trump issued a statement calling the story \"another fake story, that I flushed papers and documents down a White House toilet, is categorically untrue and simply made up by a reporter in order to get publicity for a mostly fictitious book.\" (A footnote in Howell's opinion notes, \"In August of 2022, Haberman released photos of notes at the bottom of two toilets, and, according to her sources, one photo was allegedly of a White House toilet while the other toilet was overseas.\")",
      "Eight days later, on Feb. 18, 2022, a letter from the National Archives described how President Trump allegedly brought classified records to his personal residence at Mar-a-Lago after losing the 2020 election.",
      "This kicked off a high-stakes legal fight to return the records to government control and would eventually lead to an FBI search of Trump's residence. What came next were felony charges and a series of stunning legal and political victories that would propel Trump back into office and make the charges he faced effectively disappear.",
      "But as questions swirled around the February 2022 allegations of mishandling of records by Trump, Bloomberg News reporter Jason Leopold filed a FOIA request for six categories of documents. The first five categories pertained to documents stored at Mar-a-Lago, but the sixth category requested information about any records mentioning \"Presidential Records from the Trump White House that were destroyed and ... allegedly flushed down the toilet.\"",
      "The FBI argued they were exempt from responding to the request about the Mar-a-Lago investigation citing possible harm that could come to a prosecution and issued a so-called \"Glomar\" response to part six of the request, meaning the FBI would not confirm or deny the existence of records about alleged toilet documents.",
      "The term Glomar is a reference to a secret CIA operation during the Cold War to raise a lost Soviet submarine from the ocean floor -- when details of the operation began to leak the government provided a response that neither confirmed nor denied the existence of the operation.",
      "Some of the information from the Mar-a-Lago investigation files was eventually released but the sixth category has remained secret.",
      "The landmark Trump immunity case that held a president is presumptively immune from criminal prosecution for official acts and his election victory which brought a dismissal to the case had the effect of wiping away the constraints that had permitted the FBI to withhold records under FOIA.",
      "Howell writes, \"somewhat ironically, the constitutional and procedural safeguards attached to the criminal process include significant confidentiality mechanisms,\" but for an immune president, such protections, \"may simply be unavailable, as it is here.\"",
      "\"The FBI's Glomar response is improper, and the categorical withholding of the responsive records contained within the Mar-a-Lago investigative file is insupportable where, as here, no pending law enforcement proceeding exists, or can be reasonably anticipated, and the Mar-a-Lago investigation has been iced,\" Howell writes.",
      "No records were released immediately in the case, but the parties must submit a joint status report in 10 days to propose a schedule to conclude this case. It is unclear if the government will seek an appeal to block any further release.",

      "Winter storm warnings extended from Kentucky to southern New Jersey, and a flood watch was posted for a wide swath of Kentucky, Tennessee, southwest Virginia and northern Georgia. The snow-and-ice mix was expected to become all rain as temperatures climb by Wednesday afternoon.",
      "A separate storm system is set to bring heavy snow from Kansas and Missouri to the Great Lakes on Wednesday, the weather service said.",
      "Dangerous cold was forecast Tuesday from an Arctic air mass stretching from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes.",
      "In Detroit, two children under age 10 likely died from exposure to the cold after they were discovered with other family members Monday in a van in a casino parking garage, police said. Their family may have been living in the van, police said.",
      "\u201cThis was unnecessary. It didn\u2019t have to happen this way,\u201d police Capt. Nathan Duda told WJBK-TV.",
      "Officials in Oregon\u2019s Multnomah County \u2014 who already confirmed a hypothermia death earlier this month \u2014 said three severe weather shelters with over 230 beds will open in the Portland area Monday night, when a state of emergency is set to take effect. The regional office of homeless services was also set to enhance its outreach program to distribute warm clothing, blankets and hand warmers to an estimated nearly 4,000 people living outside in the metro area.",
      "Morning low temperatures could drop under 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6.7 Celsius) through Wednesday, and gusty winds could make temperatures feel under 10 degrees (minus 17 Celsius), the weather service office in Portland said on X. Freezing rain may hit the area from Wednesday night through Thursday night, with another system possibly bringing more precipitation over the weekend.",
      "Severe winter weather has paralyzed Portland in the past. The city, which is more used to rain, only partially treats its street grid in the event of snow and ice and does not plow side streets. Such weather in the region can also prove deadly. Last year, snow, freezing rain, ice and frigid temperatures were blamed for at least 10 deaths in Oregon from hypothermia and falling trees or utility poles.",
      "The temperature was expected to bottom out Tuesday morning at minus 33 degrees (minus 36 degrees Celsius) in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people died due to cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission. Advocates for the homeless in the city of about 35,000 planned to be out on the streets distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold weather gear to anyone who needs them, Erickson said.",
      "\u201cWhen it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving all those resources available literally can save their life or keep them from frostbite.\u201d",

      "Linda McMahon once described herself as an outsider stepping into the world of education, a business leader with an \u201cinquiring mind\u201d who would challenge the status quo and demand more for students",
      "WASHINGTON -- Linda McMahon once described herself as an outsider stepping into the world of education, a business leader with an \u201cinquiring mind\u201d who would challenge the status quo and demand more for students.",
      "That was 15 years ago, when McMahon was beginning a stint on the Connecticut Board of Education. But her backers describe her similarly today as she seeks to become the nation\u2019s next education chief.",
      "She has few of the qualifications typical of the job, yet supporters see that as a strength. She has a clinical business mind and few allegiances in an industry that President Donald Trump promises to upend \u2014 starting with his vow to abolish the U.S. Education Department itself.",
      "\u201cHer most important qualification is her private-sector experience,\u201d said Ed Patru, a friend and former spokesperson during her 2010 Senate campaign. \u201cThe public\u2019s perception of what constitutes a qualified candidate has changed dramatically. Americans are more distrustful of government.\u201d",
      "McMahon's nomination to lead the department throws her into a rancorous political battle.",
      "The White House is weighing an executive order directing the education secretary to cut the agency as much as possible and urging Congress to close it entirely. Already, Trump\u2019s appointees have put dozens of employees on paid leave and invited Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to slash spending.",
      "Democrats in Congress are launching a counteroffensive, warning Trump has no authority to dismantle the department or its core programs, which send tens of billions of dollars a year to schools, universities and students. At McMahon's committee confirmation hearing Thursday, Democrats are teed up to grill her on Trump's plan and her willingness to carry it out.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he told McMahon closing the department would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for students nationwide. \u201cMillions of kids rely on our public schools for their education,\u201d he said after a meeting with the nominee.",
      "Trump already has issued a flurry of orders demanding new action from the Education Department, including plans to repurpose federal money for school choice, aggressively investigate antisemitism on college campuses and cut federal money for schools that teach controversial lessons on race and gender.",
      "It could present a conundrum for McMahon, who would be ordered to execute an array of new initiatives while also winding the department down.",
      "McMahon and her husband, Vince, became famous for building the wrestling empire that would become World Wrestling Entertainment, a megabrand that made them stars and billionaires. Linda was CEO until she left in 2009 and made two unsuccessful bids for the U.S. Senate. She later became a close ally to Trump, who put her at the helm of the Small Business Administration during his first term.",
      "She has a thinner record on education than most previous secretaries. She spent a year on the Connecticut Board of Education in 2009 and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut.",
      "On higher education, McMahon has voiced support for apprenticeships and other alternatives to traditional degrees. At the K-12 level, she has called for expanded school choice and more transparency in classroom curriculum.",
      "There are questions about how closely McMahon's views on some issues align with those of Trump, who has railed against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and believes America\u2019s schools have become overtaken by \u201cwokeness.\u201d In the past McMahon has called herself a fiscal conservative but a social moderate.",
      "McMahon recently opposed proposal from former President Joe Biden's administration that would have required diversity initiatives in apprenticeship programs. But speaking on a St. Louis radio show last March, she said some aspects of DEI are \"laudable\" and \u201cwe ought to make sure we do have diversity.\u201d",
      "McMahon did not respond to interview requests for this story.",
      "In her past education roles, McMahon was seen as willing to learn the ins and outs of the institutions she served.",
      "Anthony Cernera appointed McMahon to Sacred Heart\u2019s board of trustees in 2004 when he was the school\u2019s president. She studied for every meeting and closely monitored university finances, he said. \u201cShe knew what her job was, and she did it,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2009, McMahon was appointed to Connecticut\u2019s state education board after calling the governor amid concerns that Greenwich Public Schools, the district her two children had attended, had failed to meet some federal testing benchmarks.",
      "At her confirmation hearing, McMahon said she was astounded that a city as wealthy as Greenwich was falling behind in education. She raised alarms about widening academic achievement gaps by race and class.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t come before you today as an educator \u2014 I make no bones about that,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cI don\u2019t have any answers, but I have an open mind.\u201d",
      "After attending regular meetings for about a year, she resigned for her 2010 Senate bid. Running as a self-financed Republican, McMahon was dogged by her history with pro wrestling, facing criticism for its violence, sexuality and allegations over steroid use among wrestlers.",
      "New allegations surfaced last year when a lawsuit accused the McMahons of allowing a longtime WWE announcer to sexually abuse young \u201cring boys\u201d from the 1970s to the 1990s.",
      "Laura Brevetti, a lawyer for Linda McMahon, said the suit is baseless and \u201cfilled with scurrilous lies, exaggerations, and misrepresentations.\u201d",
      "After losing her Senate race in 2010 and again in 2012, McMahon stayed involved in politics as a donor. A longtime friend of Trump, she gave $7 million to his 2016 campaign, plus another $30 million over his next two campaigns, according to federal records.",
      "Along with co-chairing Trump's transition team, McMahon is also a director of the president's media company, which owns his Truth Social platform. If confirmed, McMahon said she will leave the board and forfeit stocks that were to be awarded to her over the next two years, according to an ethics disclosure.",
      "At the SBA, McMahon was credited with beefing up its capacity to award loans after natural disasters. Upon her arrival, she challenged the agency to be ready for as many as three disasters in a single season \u2014 just months before the U.S. was slammed by three major hurricanes in 2017.",
      "When she resigned in 2019, she drew bipartisan praise. Her nomination as education secretary, however, has drawn mixed responses.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, said she has doubts about McMahon\u2019s qualifications. The agency needs someone who will \u201cstand up for students and teachers,\u201d she said.",
      "McMahon faces opposition from the nation\u2019s two major teachers unions, along with civil rights advocacy groups. Republicans have generally supported her selection, saying she understands how education can fuel the economy.",
      "Early this year, McMahon visited Capitol Hill to meet with senators ahead of her confirmation hearing. In social media posts describing the visits, McMahon said she would \u201creform\u201d the Education Department.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m ready to make America\u2019s education system great again,\u201d she said on X. \u201cLet\u2019s get this done together.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "More than two-dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans have filed a federal court lawsuit challenging a Trump administration move giving immigration agents more leeway to make arrests at houses of worship",
      "More than two-dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans \u2014 ranging from the Episcopal Church and the Union for Reform Judaism to the Mennonites and Unitarian Universalists \u2014 filed a federal court lawsuit Tuesday challenging a Trump administration move giving immigration agents more leeway to make arrests at houses of worship.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, contends that the new policy is spreading fear of raids, thus lowering attendance at worship services and other valuable church programs. The result, says the suit, infringes on the groups\u2019 religious freedom \u2014 namely their ability to minister to migrants, including those in the United States illegally.",
      "\u201cWe have immigrants, refugees, people who are documented and undocumented,\u201d said the Most Rev. Sean Rowe, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.",
      "\u201cWe cannot worship freely if some of us are living in fear,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cBy joining this lawsuit, we\u2019re seeking the ability to gather and fully practice our faith, to follow Jesus\u2019 command to love our neighbors as ourselves.\u201d",
      "The new lawsuit echoes and expands on some of the arguments made in a similar lawsuit filed Jan. 27 by five Quaker congregations and later joined by the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and a Sikh temple. It is currently pending in U.S. District Court in Maryland.",
      "There was no immediate Trump administration response to the new lawsuit, which names the Department of Homeland Security and its immigration enforcement agencies as defendants. However, a memorandum filed Friday by the Department of Justice, opposing the thrust of the Quaker lawsuit, outlined arguments that may also apply to the new lawsuit.",
      "In essence, the memo contended that the plaintiffs\u2019 request to block the new enforcement policy is based on speculation of hypothetical future harm \u2014 and thus is insufficient grounds for issuing an injunction.",
      "The memo said that immigration enforcement affecting houses of worship had been permitted for decades, and the new policy announced in January simply said that field agents \u2014 using \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cdiscretion\u201d \u2014 could now conduct such operations without pre-approval from a supervisor.",
      "One part of that memo might not apply to the new lawsuit, as it argued the Quakers and their fellow plaintiffs have no basis for seeking a nationwide injunction against the revised enforcement policy.",
      "\u201cAny relief in this case should be tailored solely to the named plaintiffs,\u201d said the DOJ memo, contending that any injunction should not apply to other religious organizations.",
      "The plaintiffs in the new lawsuit represent a vastly larger swath of American worshippers \u2014 including more than 1 million followers of Reform Judaism, the estimated 1.5 million Episcopalians in 6,700 congregations nationwide, nearly 1.1 million members of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and the estimated 1.5 million active members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church \u2014 the country\u2019s oldest predominantly Black denomination.",
      "Among the other plaintiffs are the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), with more than 3,000 congregations; the Church of the Brethren, with more than 780 congregations; the Convenci\u00f3n Bautista Hispana de Texas, encompassing about 1,100 Hispanic Baptist churches; the Friends General Conference, an association of regional Quaker organizations; the Mennonite Church USA, with about 50,000 members; the Unitarian Universalist Association, with more than 1,000 congregations; the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, with more than 500 U.S. congregations; and regional branches of the United Methodist Church and the United Church of Christ.",
      "\u201cThe massive scale of the suit will be hard for them to ignore,\u201d said Kelsi Corkran, a lawyer with the Georgetown University Law Center\u2019s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection who is lead counsel for the lawsuit.",
      "The plaintiffs joined the suit, she said, \u201cbecause their scripture, teaching, and traditions offer irrefutable unanimity on their religious obligation to embrace and serve the refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants in their midst without regard to documentation or legal status.\u201d",
      "Prior to the recent Trump administration change, Corkran said immigration agents generally needed a judicial warrant or other special authorization to conduct operations at houses of worship and other \u201csensitive locations\" such as schools and hospitals.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s go anywhere, any time,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cNow they have broad authority to swoop in \u2014 they\u2019ve made it very clear they\u2019ll get every undocumented person.\u201d",
      "She cited a recent incident in which a Honduran man was arrested outside his family\u2019s Atlanta-area church while a service was being held inside.",
      "The lawsuit includes details from some of the plaintiffs as to how their operations might be affected. The Union for Reform Judaism and the Mennonites, among others, said many of their synagogues and churches host on-site foodbanks, meal programs, homeless shelters and other support services for undocumented people who might now be fearful of participating.",
      "One of the plaintiffs is the Latino Christian National Network, which seeks to bring together Latino leaders with different traditions and values to collaborate on pressing social issues. The network\u2019s president is the Rev. Carlos Malav\u00e9, a pastor of two churches in Virginia, who described to the AP what network members are observing.",
      "\u201cThere is deep-seated fear and distrust of our government,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople fear going to the store, they are avoiding going to church. ... The churches are increasingly doing online services because people fear for the well-being of their families.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which leads the nation's largest denomination, did not join the lawsuit, though it has criticized Trump's migration crackdown. On Tuesday, Pope Francis issued a major rebuke of the deportation plan, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity and \u201cwill end badly.\u201d",
      "Many conservative faith leaders and legal experts across the U.S. do not share concerns about the new arrest policy.",
      "\u201cPlaces of worship are for worship and are not sanctuaries for illegal activity or for harboring people engaged in illegal activity,\u201d said Mat Staver, founder of the conservative Christian legal organization Liberty Counsel.",
      "\u201cFugitives or criminals are not immune from the law merely because they enter a place of worship,\u201d he said via email. \u201cThis is not a matter of religious freedom. There is no right to openly violate the law and disobey law enforcement.\u201d",
      "Professor Cathleen Kaveny, who teaches in the theology department and law school at Boston College, questioned whether the plaintiffs would prevail with the religious freedom argument, but suggested the Trump administration might be unwise to disregard a traditional view of houses of worship as places of sanctuary for vulnerable people.",
      "\u201cThese buildings are different \u2014 almost like embassies,\u201d she said. \u201cI think of churches as belonging to an eternal country.\u201d",

      "Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be director of national intelligence, is another step closer to Senate confirmation",
      "WASHINGTON -- Tulsi Gabbard moved a step closer to being the next director of national intelligence Monday after the U.S. Senate advanced her nomination to a final vote planned for later this week.",
      "The Senate could hold its final vote on confirming Gabbard as soon as Wednesday following Monday's 52-46 procedural vote to end debate on her nomination, which fell along party lines.",
      "Created following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence oversees and coordinates the work of 18 intelligence agencies.",
      "A former Democratic congresswoman, Gabbard is one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most contentious nominees, given her past comments sympathetic to Edward Snowden and Russia and a meeting with Syria\u2019s now-deposed leader.",
      "With strong Democratic opposition and only a thin Republican majority, almost all GOP senators will need to vote yes for her to win confirmation. Gabbard's chances greatly improved last week after some Republican lawmakers who had expressed concerns about her affirmed their support in the face of a pressure campaign mounted by Trump allies including Elon Musk.",
      "Gabbard is a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard who deployed twice to the Middle East and ran for president in 2020.",
      "Her past praise of Snowden drew particularly harsh questions during her Senate nomination hearing. The former National Security Agency contractor fled to Russia after he was charged with revealing classified information about surveillance programs.",
      "Gabbard said that while Snowden broke laws about the protection of classified secrets, he revealed important facts about surveillance programs she believes are unconstitutional.",
      "A 2017 visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad was another flash point. Assad was recently deposed following a brutal civil war in which he was accused of using chemical weapons.

      "Straws might seem insignificant, inspiring jokes about the plastic vs. paper debate, but the plastic straw has come to symbolize a global pollution crisis over the past decade.",
      "On Monday, President Donald Trump waded into the issue when he signed an executive order to reverse a federal push away from plastic straws, declaring that paper straws \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don\u2019t last very long. Trump said he thinks \u201cit\u2019s OK\u201d to continue using plastic straws, although they've have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life.",
      "In 2015, video of a marine biologist pulling a plastic straw out of a turtle\u2019s nose sparked outrage worldwide and countries and cities started banning them, starting with the Pacific Island nation Vanuatu and Seattle in 2018.",

      "More than 390 million plastic straws are used every day in the United States, most for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Turtle Island Restoration Network.",
      "Plastic straws are usually thrown away after one use, going on to litter beaches and waterways and potentially killing marine animals that mistake them for food.",
      "The straws are not recyclable because they are so small. They take at least 200 years to decompose, the network said.",
      "They break down into incredibly tiny bits of plastic smaller than a fraction of a grain of rice. These microplastics have been found in a wide range of body tissues. Though research is still limited overall, there are growing concerns that microplastics in the body could potentially be linked to heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia, and other problems.",
      "Trump's executive order claims that paper straws use chemicals that may carry risks to human health are more expensive to produce than plastic straws. Researchers from the University of Antwerp found forever chemicals known as PFAS to be present in paper, bamboo, glass and plastic straws, but not stainless steel ones, according to a 2023 study.",
      "The advocacy group Beyond Plastics said that while plastics are often cheaper than paper products, the cheapest option is to skip the straw.",

It\u2019s not that hard to do.\u201d",

      "Erin Simon, an expert on plastics and packaging at the World Wildlife Fund, said at the time that it sent a message around the world: If we can make change happen at scale, so can you.",
      "The declaration came in July, just a few months before negotiators met in South Korea to try to finish crafting a treaty to address the global crisis of plastic pollution. Negotiators didn\u2019t reach an agreement late last year, but talks resume this year.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the United States at first adopted a position viewed as favoring industry, stating that countries should largely develop their own plans instead of abiding by global rules. China, the United States and Germany are the biggest players in the global plastics trade.",

      "The average American student remains half a grade level behind pre-pandemic levels of achievement in both reading and math",
      "COMPTON, Calif. -- COMPTON, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Math is the subject sixth grader Harmoni Knight finds hardest, but that's changing.",
      "In-class tutors and \u201cdata chats\u201d at her middle school in Compton, California, have made a dramatic difference, the 11-year-old said. She proudly pulled up a performance tracker at a tutoring session last week, displaying a column of perfect 100% scores on all her weekly quizzes from January.",
      "Since the pandemic first shuttered American classrooms, schools have poured federal and local relief money into interventions like the ones in Harmoni's classroom, hoping to help students catch up academically following COVID-19 disruptions.",
      "But a new analysis of state and national test scores shows the average student remains half a grade level behind pre-pandemic achievement in both reading and math. In reading, especially, students are even further behind than they were in 2022, the analysis shows.",
      "Compton is an outlier, making some of the biggest two-year gains in both subjects among high-poverty districts. And there are other bright spots, along with evidence that interventions like tutoring and summer programs are working.",
      "The Education Recovery Scorecard analysis by researchers at Harvard, Stanford and Dartmouth allows year-to-year comparisons across states and districts, providing the most comprehensive picture yet of how American students are performing since COVID-19 first disrupted learning.",
      "The most recent data is based on tests taken in spring 2024. By then, the worst of the pandemic was long past, but schools were dealing still with a mental health crisis and high absenteeism \u2014 not to mention students who'd had crucial learning interrupted.",
      "\u201cThe losses are not just due to what happened during the 2020 to 2021 school year, but the aftershocks that have hit schools in the years since,\u201d said Tom Kane, a Harvard economist who worked on the scorecard.",
      "In some cases, the analysis shows school districts are struggling, even though their students may have posted decent results on state tests. That\u2019s because each state adopts its own assessments, and those aren\u2019t comparable to each other. Those differences can make it impossible to tell whether students are performing better because of their progress, or whether those shifts are because the tests themselves are changing, or the state has lowered its standards for proficiency. For example, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Florida seem to have relaxed their proficiency cutoff in math and reading in the last two years, Kane said, citing the analysis.",
      "The Scorecard accounts for differing state tests and provides one national standard.",
      "Higher-income districts have made significantly more progress than lower-income districts, with the top 10% of high-income districts four times more likely to have recovered in both math and reading compared with the poorest 10%. And recovery within districts remains divided by race and class, especially in math scores. Test score gaps grew by both race and income.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic has not only driven test scores down, but that decline masks a pernicious inequality that has grown during the pandemic,\u201d said Sean Reardon, a Stanford sociologist who worked on the scorecard. \u201cNot only are districts serving more Black and Hispanic students falling further behind, but even within those districts, Black and Hispanic students are falling further behind their white districtmates.\u201d",
      "Still, many of the districts that outperformed the country serve predominantly low-income students or students of color, and their interventions offer best practices for other districts.",
      "In Compton, the district responded to the pandemic by hiring over 250 tutors that specialize in math, reading and students learning English. Certain classes are staffed with multiple tutors to assist teachers. And schools offer tutoring before, during and after school, plus \u201cSaturday School\u201d and summer programs for the district\u2019s 17,000 students, said Superintendent Darin Brawley.",
      "The district also now conducts dyslexia screenings in all elementary schools.",
      "The low-income school district near downtown Los Angeles, with a student body that is 84% Latino and 14% Black, now has a graduation rate of 93%, compared with 58% when Brawley took the job in 2012.",
      "Harmoni, the sixth grader, said tutoring has helped her grasp concepts and given her more confidence in math. She has \u201cdata chats\u201d with her math specialist that are part performance review, part pep talk.",
      "\u201cLooking at my data, it kind of disappoints me\u201d when the numbers are low, said Harmoni. \u201cBut it makes me realize I can do better in the future, and also now.\u201d",
      "Brawley said he\u2019s proud of the district's latest test scores, but not content.",
      "\u201cTruth be told, I wasn\u2019t happy,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though we gained, and we celebrate the gains, at the end of the day we all know that we can do better.\u201d",
      "That could be more difficult in coming years. Federal pandemic relief money has ended; many schools used it for programs like tutoring. Going forward, schools must prioritize interventions that worked. Districts that spent federal money on increased instructional time, either through tutoring or summer school, saw a return on that investment, Kane and Reardon said.",
      "Brawley said Compton hopes to maintain its tutoring programs using other funding sources. \u201cThe question is, at what scale?\u201d",
      "Elsewhere in the country, reading levels have continued to decline, despite a movement in many states to emphasize phonics and the \u201c science of reading.\u201d So Reardon and Kane called for an evaluation of the mixed results for insights into the best ways to teach kids to read. Schools also must engage parents and tell them when their kids are behind, the researchers said.",
      "And schools must continue to work with community groups to improve students' attendance, they said. The scorecard identified a relationship between high absenteeism and learning struggles.",
      "In the District of Columbia, an intensive tutoring program helped with both academics and attendance, D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Lewis Ferebee said. In the scorecard analysis, the District of Columbia ranked first among states for gains in both math and reading between 2022 and 2024, after its math recovery had fallen toward the bottom of the list.",
      "Pandemic-relief money funded the tutoring, along with a system of identifying and targeting support at students in greatest need. The district also hired program managers who helped maximize time for tutoring within the school day, Ferebee said.",
      "Students who received tutoring were more likely to be engaged with school, Ferebee said, both from increased confidence and because they had a relationship with another trusted adult.",
      "Students expressed that \u201cI'm more confident in math because I'm being validated by another adult,\u201d Ferebee said. \"That validation goes a long way, not only with attendance, but a student feeling like they are ready to learn and are capable.\u201d",
      "Even now that federal pandemic relief money has ended, Ferebee said many of the investments the district made will have lasting impact, including the money spent on teacher training and curriculum development in literacy.",
      "Christina Grant, the District of Columbia's superintendent of education until 2024, said she's hopeful to see the evidence emerging on what's made a difference in student achievement.",
      "\u201cWe cannot afford to not have hope. These are our students. They did not cause the pandemic,\u201d Grant said. \u201cThe growing concern is ensuring that we can ... see ourselves to the other side.\u201d",

      "The U.S. border czar has pushed back against Pope Francis' criticism of the U.S. mass deportation of migrants plan",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis issued a major rebuke Tuesday to the Trump administration\u2019s plans for mass deportations of migrants, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity and \u201cwill end badly.\u201d",
      "Francis took the remarkable step of addressing the U.S. migrant crackdown in a letter to U.S. bishops in which he appeared to take direct aim at Vice President JD Vance's defense of the deportation program on theological grounds.",
      "U.S. border czar Tom Homan immediately pushed back, saying Francis should leave border enforcement to his office and noted the Vatican is a city-state surrounded by fortress-like walls.",

Francis has also said governments are expected to do so to the limits of their capacity.",
      "The Argentine Jesuit and President Donald Trump have long sparred over migration, including before Trump's first administration when Francis in 2016 famously said anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants rather than bridges was \u201cnot a Christian.\u201d",
      "In the letter, Francis said nations have the right to defend themselves and keep their communities safe from criminals.",
      "\u201cThat said, the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Citing the Book of Exodus and Jesus Christ\u2019s own experience, Francis affirmed the right of people to seek shelter and safety in other lands and described the deportation plan as a \u201cmajor crisis\u201d unfolding in the U.S.",
      "Anyone schooled in Christianity \"cannot fail to make a critical judgment and express its disagreement with any measure that tacitly or explicitly identifies the illegal status of some migrants with criminality,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhat is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly,\u201d he wrote.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week that more than 8,000 people had been arrested in immigration enforcement actions since Trump took office Jan. 20. Some have been deported, others are being held in federal prisons and still others are being held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.",
      "Vance, a Catholic convert, has defended the administration's America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as \u201cordo amoris.\u201d He has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care \u2014 to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere.",
      "In his letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance's understanding of the concept.",
      "\u201cChristian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,\u201d he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the \u2018Good Samaritan,\u2019 that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"",
      "David Gibson, director of the center for religion and culture at Fordham University, said in a social media post that Francis' letter \u201ctakes aim at every single absurd theological claim by JD Vance and his allies in conservative Catholicism (and the Catholic electorate).\"",
      "\u201cThis is the pope also directly countering misinformation about the Catholic faith that is being expounded by the Catholic vice president,\u201d he added to The Associated Press. \u201cAnd it is the pope supporting the bishops as well.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s reference to the ordo amoris had won support from many on the Catholic right in the U.S., including the Catholic League, which said he was right about the hierarchy of Christian love.",
      "Writing in Crisis Magazine, editor Eric Sammons said Vance was merely drawing on the wisdom of St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas and the broader teaching of the Church to insist on loving things in an order.",
      "\u201cFor Augustine, every love, even the love of neighbor, must be ordered beneath the love of God,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis hierarchy extends to our human relationships where love for family, community, and nation should precede our love for the world at large, not in intensity but in priority of duty and responsibility.\u201d",
      "Homan, a Catholic, said Francis should fix the Catholic Church and leave U.S. border protection to his department.",
      "\u201cHe wants to attack us for securing our border. He's got a wall around the Vatican, does he not?\" Homan told reporters in a video from The Hill posted on X. \"So he's got a wall around that protects his people and himself, but we can't have a wall around the United States.\"",
      "The Vatican, a walled-in, 44-hectare (108-acre) city state inside Rome, recently increased sanctions for anyone who illegally enters the territory. The December law calls for a prison term of up to four years and a fine of up to 25,000 euros ($25,873) for anyone who enters with \u201cviolence, threat or deception,\" such as by evading security checkpoints.",

It said those \"focused on the treatment of immigrants and refugees, foreign aid, expansion of the death penalty, and the environment, are deeply troubling and will have negative consequences, many of which will harm the most vulnerable among us.\u201d",
      "It was a strong rebuke from the U.S. Catholic hierarchy, which considers abortion to be the \u201cpreeminent priority\u201d for Catholic voters and had cheered the 2022 Supreme Court decision to end constitutional protections for abortion that was made possible by Trump-appointed justices. Trump won 54% of Catholic voters in the 2024 election, a wider margin than the 50% in the 2020 election won by President Joe Biden, a Catholic.",
      "It\u2019s not unusual for a pope to address a country\u2019s bishops or faithful to deliver a specific message. But it\u2019s rare for a pope to weigh in on a specific political program of a country with such a letter, although migration is certainly an issue that the U.S. Catholic Church has long had at the forefront of its agenda.",

      "In the wake of deadly disasters, communities across the United States have banded together to search for lost photographs stuck in rivers and trees, or buried in the rubble",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Hollowed-out homes. Cars entombed by mud. Unpeopled roads. Belongings reduced to dirt and debris.",
      "It all took a toll on Taylor Schenker.",
      "After Hurricane Helene last September, Schenker was upset by the deluge of images of Asheville, North Carolina. \u201cThis storm has taken so much,\" she said, \u201cand it\u2019s so jarring to see the photos of the horrible devastation.\u201d So less than a week after the storm, she set out to do something about the wide-scale loss.",
      "While helping a friend search for belongings cast downriver, she stumbled on a handful of photos of strangers \u2014 mud-caked, curled up in tree branches and stuck under river rocks. The images captured family reunions, newborn babies, weddings, birthday parties, beloved pets and school portraits.",
      "\u201cThese tiny photos had been through so much and miraculously had washed up and were in decent enough condition that you could see what they were,\u201d said Schenker, 27. \u201cIt stuck with me.\u201d",
      "To reclaim the search phrase \u201cphotos from Helene,\u201d she created an Instagram for \u201csomething positive, which is reuniting people with their memories.\u201d She set up a post-office box, linked up with a volunteer search and rescue crew, and ultimately uncovered more than 500 photos \u2014 or what she calls \u201clittle needles in a haystack.\u201d",
      "When Schenker made her first match, she got chills.",
      "Then, sitting in her car, she cried.",
      "We hold onto photos to keep memories alive \u2014 of people, places and moments that might otherwise fade. Or sometimes are ripped away abruptly.",
      "Schenker has since returned more than 70 such images. A stack of them were hand-delivered to Mary Moss, whose car was destroyed by an uprooted tree as she and her husband evacuated the Asheville home where they had lived for almost 40 years.",
      "\u201cIt was really kind of overwhelming at first when she handed me those pictures. I just couldn\u2019t even speak,\u201d Moss said. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect something as fragile as photos to be retrieved.\u201d",
      "Months later, they\u2019ve received some FEMA assistance and found a temporary home, which they\u2019re gradually furnishing with church donations. But some things are irreplaceable.",
      "\u201cThis is not really about losing the home and all the material stuff in there. But what\u2019s been devastating is that that was everything we had of Tommy,\u201d she said, of their son who died at age 12 from a genetic disorder. \u201cIt\u2019s those memories and the little things, the photos, that you can\u2019t replace.\u201d",
      "As Schenker later understood it, \u201cWhen they lost their home, they lost virtually all proof that this child existed.\"",
      "\u201cIt is such a privilege to look into the intimate moments of people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve literally lost everything and they can\u2019t ever recreate those childhood photos.\u201d",
      "In photos Schenker found nearly 3 miles (5 km) from the Moss' family home, Tommy is seen as a 2-year-old, dressed like an angel for a Christmas pageant. In another, he is wearing a toddler-sized suit; in yet another, he\u2019s playing at daycare alongside his younger brother Dallas.",
      "\u201cIt is just breathtaking,\" Moss said. \u201cThis is one thing that the river didn\u2019t get to take \u2014 or didn\u2019t get to keep.\u201d",
      "More than 2,000 miles (3,200 km) away, in the Altadena foothills of Los Angeles, Claire Schwartz, 31, began to collect photos with a similar idea: Find images, post them online, try to unite them with their owners.",
      "After the Eaton fire, but before the first rain, she panicked. When rain and ash mix, it makes lye, which destroys photos. \u201cSomeone has to do this ASAP,\" she remembers thinking to herself. \"And I realized it had to be me \u2014 because nobody else was doing it.\u201d",
      "Luca Ackerman, a New York-based photo conservator, cautions that mold can start to develop 48 hours after water exposure. To slow the deterioration process, he freezes such prints \u2014 and advised to not wipe off any surfaces, which can drag toxic oils across the print, \u201cdriving particles deeper into the material.\u201d Some photos are so brittle, too, that when touched they may disintegrate.",
      "In the wake of disasters, conservators like Ackerman are deployed in volunteer rotations with the National Heritage Responders. Rapidly, he trains art handlers and museum staff how to treat sensitive materials, whether they are damaged by smoke, water, ash or soot.",
      "Wearing a respirator, nitrile gloves and booties, Schwartz swiftly set out to salvage photos \u2014 finding them alongside pages from yearbooks, sheet music, and children\u2019s art in nearby parks, neighbors\u2019 front yards and a golf course.",
      "\u201cThe wind has scattered everything, everywhere. And trash is mixed in with precious mementos, everywhere you look,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely bizarre how stuff clumps together and travels as a unit.\u201d",
      "Normally, a local library would take in found items, but the Altadena Public Library, along with more than 9,000 homes, burned to the ground. Librarians are redirecting residents who have found photos to Schwartz.",
      "She adopted parts of her process from what she learned as an archival intern at the Corita Art Center \u2014 protecting photos in acid-free, glassine envelopes and storing them in a waterproof box in a temperature-controlled room with good air circulation.",
      "Last week, she made her first match: disposable camera photos of teenagers, smiling, in prom dresses and glittering tiaras. The image is flecked with damage, but all four corners are intact.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2014 you formulate these ideas of who the person is\", Schwartz said. \u201cShe was kind of exactly what I pictured, just really friendly and bubbly and lovely \u2014 you could tell that just from her photos.\u201d",
      "Schwartz's house survived because her neighbors stayed behind to fight the fire themselves, but the landscape around it \u2014 full of burned-out lots, ghostly palm trees and blackened telephone poles \u2014 is otherworldly and changed. \u201cIt looks like the moon. It looks like another planet. It doesn\u2019t look like home.\u201d",
      "Nearby is Joshua Simpson, a photographer who lost his Altadena home and studio, along with decades of film negatives, silver gelatin prints and camera equipment. But something meaningful survived.",
      "\u201cThe very first thing we found was this beautiful vintage print of my mother-in-law holding my wife when she was a newborn baby.\u201d The black-and-white photo carries an extra layer of poignancy, as his mother-in-law died just few months ago. \u201cWe were both pretty overjoyed in that moment. It felt a little magical finding that one.\u201d",
      "Above all else, Ackerman said, personal safety comes first. \u201cWhen you\u2019re picking up people\u2019s heirlooms or family photographs, that can be traumatic \u2014 even if they\u2019re not yours,\u201d he said.",
      "When people survive catastrophic events such as wildfires or hurricanes, and then are left to cope with loss, they may express a wide range of emotions \u2014 from overwhelmed to outraged to numb, sometimes all at once. Tragedies, though, can also strengthen the ties in communities, and people like Schenker and Schwartz are Exhibits A and B.",
      "\u201cDisasters like this really bring out the best in people,\u201d Moss said. \u201cYou know, I can laugh or I can cry about it \u2014 and I choose to laugh about it. Fortunately, we didn\u2019t lose the most important thing. That\u2019s lives.\u201d",

      "The state\u2019s top court has ruled Karen Read can be retried on all three charges in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend",
      "BOSTON -- The state\u2019s top court ruled Tuesday that Karen Read can be retried on all the same charges in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, the latest twist in the long-running case that transfixed true crime fans nationwide.",
      "Prosecutors have sought to retry Read this year on charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene of a crime. They accused her of ramming into John O\u2019Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die in a snowstorm in January 2022. Read\u2019s attorneys argue she was framed to protect other law enforcement officers involved in O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death.",
      "A judge declared a mistrial in June after finding jurors couldn\u2019t reach an agreement, without polling the jurors to confirm their conclusions. Read\u2019s attorney Martin Weinberg argued that five jurors later said they were deadlocked only on the manslaughter count, and had unanimously agreed in the jury room that she wasn\u2019t guilty on the charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene. But they hadn\u2019t told the judge.",
      "The ruling from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court clears the way for a new trial on all three charges.",
      "\u201cThe jury clearly stated during deliberations that they had not reached a unanimous verdict on any of the charges and could not do so. Only after being discharged did some individual jurors communicate a different supposed outcome, contradicting their prior notes,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cSuch posttrial disclosures cannot retroactively alter the trial\u2019s outcome -- either to acquit or to convict.\u201d",
      "The judges also found \u201cno abuse of discretion\u201d in Judge Beverly Cannone's decision to declare a mistrial.",
      "\u201cAfter extensive, multiday deliberations, the jury submitted several increasingly emphatic notes about their inability to reach a unanimous verdict,\" they wrote, adding that the record before the judge \u201csuggested complete deadlock.\u201d",
      "Read's lawyer said they're considering their legal options.",
      "\u201cWhile we have great respect for the Commonwealth\u2019s highest court, Double Jeopardy is a federal constitutional right,\" Weinberg said in a statement. \"We are strongly considering whether to seek federal habeas relief from what we continue to contend are violations of Ms. Read\u2019s federally guaranteed constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "Weinberg had urged the court to allow an a evidentiary hearing where jurors could be asked whether they had reached final not guilty verdicts on any of the charges.",
      "Prosecutors maintained there\u2019s no basis for dismissing the charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene. They argued that her lawyers should have sensed a mistrial was \u201cinevitable or unavoidable\u201d and that they had every opportunity to be heard in the trial courtroom.",
      "The judges questioned Weinberg over the the merits for holding an inquiry. Associate Justice Frank Gaziano noted that such inquiries are usually reserved for \u201cextraneous information\u201d such as \u201cracisms in the jury room.\" Chief Justice Kimberly Budd wondered about the limits of allowing an inquiry, which she suggested could open the door for other defendants to argue a juror came to them to say \u201cthat\u2019s not really what happened.\u201d",
      "Cannone ruled in August that Read could be retried on all three charges.",
      "\u201cWhere there was no verdict announced in open court here, retrial of the defendant does not violate the principle of double jeopardy,\u201d Cannone said.",
      "Prosecutors said Read, a former adjunct professor at Bentley College, and O\u2019Keefe, a 16-year member of the Boston police, had been drinking heavily before she dropped him off at a party at the home of Brian Albert, a fellow Boston officer. They said she hit him with her SUV before driving away. An autopsy found O\u2019Keefe had died of hypothermia and blunt force trauma.",
      "The defense portrayed Read as the victim, saying O\u2019Keefe was actually killed inside Albert\u2019s home and then dragged outside. They argued that investigators focused on Read because she was a \u201cconvenient outsider\u201d who saved them from having to consider law enforcement officers as suspects."

      "U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington agreed to issue a temporary restraining order requested by the Doctors for America advocacy group. The judge instructed the government to restore access to several webpages and datasets that the group identified as missing from websites and to identify others that also were taken down \u201cwithout adequate notice or reasoned explanation.\u201d",
      "On Jan. 20, his first day back in the White House, Trump signed an order for agencies to use the term \u201csex\u201d and not \"gender\" in federal policies and documents.

      "\u201cThese doctors\u2019 time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\u201d the judge wrote.",

This really feels different in the sense that it is not something that there is an external push or a need for. So, it feels more ideological in a way,\u201d said Jessica Thompson, a higher education policy expert with The Institute for College Access and Success.",
      "Here is a look at possible federal budget cuts that would affect higher education under the Trump administration:",

      "On the chopping block potentially are several plans students can opt into to repay their students loans, including the SAVE plan introduced by the Biden administration. That plan doesn't require borrowers to make payments if they earn less than 225% of the federal poverty line \u2014 $32,800 a year for a single person \u2014 and prevents interest from adding to balances as long as borrowers make their monthly payments. The SAVE plan was already put on hold after Republicans challenged it. Some plans do not appear to be targeted, including one that caps loan payments based on borrowers' income level.",
      "Another possible change would give borrowers additional opportunities to recover from defaults. While they currently can rehabilitate their loans just once, allowing them to make a certain number of consecutive payments to get out of default, the proposal would allow them to go through that process twice. The committee projected the new process could save the government millions of dollars but did not spell out how.",
      "The timing is uncertain on when any of these proposals could surface. They could be considered as soon as this spring in a process known as budget reconciliation that would allow Republicans to squeeze proposals through Congress purely on party-line votes.

      "Scholarships and fellowships have been exempt from taxes as long as they are used for tuition and related expenses. That would change under another proposal that's up for consideration.",
      "The changes could create new financial burdens for students and families, advocates say.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been great progress in bringing down the costs of higher education. Adjusted for inflation, public university tuition is less now than it was ten years ago,\" said Craig Lindwarm, senior vice president of governmental affairs with the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities. \"But as we look at some of the proposals that are options, many would increase costs on students and families, and I think (the proposals) are heading in the direction that most don\u2019t want to see, which is increasing expenses on students and families.\u201d",
      "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act currently requires some private nonprofit colleges and universities to pay a 1.4% tax on income from their endowments, which raised about $244 million from 58 institutions in 2022.

Title VI is currently what is being used to investigate complaints of antisemitism on college campuses across the U.S.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Officials and federal officers turned away scores of U.S. Agency for International staffers who showed up for work Monday at its Washington headquarters, after a court temporarily blocked a Trump administration order that would have pulled all but a fraction of workers off the job worldwide.",
      "A front desk officer told a steady stream of agency staffers \u2014 dressed in business clothes or USAID sweatshirts or T-shirts \u2014 that he had a list of no more than 10 names of people allowed to enter the building. Tarps hung over USAID's interior signs.",

      "Even as Trump and Musk have taken aim at other government agencies, USAID has been hit hardest so far. The president signed an executive order freezing foreign assistance so the administration could review spending that it says is wasteful or not aligned with Trump's agenda.",
      "That has forced U.S.-funded aid and development programs worldwide to shut down and lay off staff even as Secretary of State Marco Rubio had sought to mitigate the damage by issuing a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs.",
      "Despite the waiver, aid groups say the government has not resumed payments. Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the largest humanitarian groups, called the U.S. cutoff the most devastating in its 79-year history and said Monday that it will have to suspend programs serving hundreds of thousands of people in 20 countries.",
      "\u201cThe impact of this will be felt severely by the most vulnerable, from deeply neglected Burkina Faso, where we are the only organization supplying clean water to the 300,000 trapped in the blockaded city of Djibo, to war-torn Sudan, where we support nearly 500 bakeries in Darfur providing daily subsidized bread to hundreds of thousands of hunger-stricken people,\u201d the group said in a statement.",

      "A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked a Trump administration order that would have put thousands of USAID staffers on administrative leave that same day and given those abroad 30 days to get back to the United States at government expense.",
      "The temporary restraining order came in a lawsuit by two groups representing federal workers, and another hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",
      "While the judge ordered the administration to restore agency email access for staffers, the order said nothing about reopening USAID headquarters. Some staffers and contractors reported having their agency email restored by Monday, while others said they did not.",
      "Some staffers told The Associated Press that they came to the USAID offices because they were confused by conflicting agency emails and notices over the weekend about whether they should go in. Others expected they would be turned away but went anyway.",
      "Some who asked to go retrieve belongings were denied entrance.",
      "A USAID email sent Sunday night, saying it was \u201cFrom the office of the administrator,\u201d told employees that what it called \u201cthe former USAID headquarters\u201d and other USAID offices in the Washington area were closed until further notice. It told workers to telework unless they are instructed otherwise.",

      "A record 13 women had been serving as governor this year",
      "PHOENIX -- South Dakota\u2019s constitution refers to the governor as a \u201che.\u201d",
      "But for the past six years, the governor was a \u201cshe\u201d \u2014 Kristi Noem, the first female to hold the position there. The conservative Republican pushed a constitutional amendment to change the gendered language. But voters rejected the measure in the 2024 general election that also would have been inclusive of nonbinary people.",
      "Across the nation, state constitutions presume officeholders are male, and they increasingly are outdated. This year, a record of 13 women were serving as governor before Noem stepped down to serve in President Donald Trump's Cabinet. In state legislatures, 2,469 women are serving, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.",
      "Most states haven't modernized their constitutions to reflect the rise of women in politics. Among those that have are New York's, which became gender-neutral in 2001, and Vermont's, where voters approved a change from \u201cmen\u201d to \u201cpersons\u201d in 1994.",
      "An effort in Washington state to update the state's constitution died in a legislative committee in 2023. In Connecticut, state Sen. Mae Flexer says she'll make another run at revising the constitution in this year's legislative session. Some states, like Nevada and California, have made changes within their legislatures to refer to lawmakers as assemblymembers instead of assemblymen or assemblywomen.",
      "\u201cLanguage matters, it conveys a message about values, it conveys a message about who belongs,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics.",

      "\u201cThe South Dakota state constitution requires the governor to begin each legislative session by giving the Legislature information concerning the affairs of the state and recommending the measures he considers necessary,\u201d Noem said. \u201cNotice I didn\u2019t say \u2018she.\u2019 The constitution doesn\u2019t say she, and maybe we should fix that sometime.\"",
      "A few months later, Noem signed a bill to update male references to more gender-neutral language in state law, such as changing \u201che shall deem\u201d to \u201cthe Governor deems.\u201d But amending the state's founding document requires voter approval \u2014 and South Dakotans didn't go for it.",
      "The bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Erin Tobin, saw it as a way to reflect the state's progress in electing women and celebrating them. She said the amendment failed partly because of the word \u201cpronoun\u201d in the ballot question.",
      "It entangled the effort with the broader conservative sentiment that \u201cnonbinary\u201d is not a legitimate gender identity. Others cited a lack of campaigning for or against the measure and concerns over the financial cost of making a change.",
      "Although \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d are inherently inclusive of many transgender people who use those pronouns, Noem has a track record opposing gender transitions.",
      "Noem signed a bill in 2023 prohibiting gender-affirming care for youth and in 2022 signed a bill banning transgender girls and college-age women from playing in school sports leagues that match their gender identity.",
      "Noem resigned her office in late January to oversee the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under Trump, who issued an executive order last month directing the federal government to recognize only two sexes \u2014 male and female. Trump also signed an executive order Wednesday that intended to prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports.",
      "Trump emphasized his opposition to transgender rights in his 2024 presidential bid. Aligned political action committees spent tens of millions of dollars on anti-transgender attack ads.",
      "Had she been unfamiliar with the South Dakota measure, Tobin said she would have voted no based on how it read. The state\u2019s attorney general writes the titles and explanations for constitutional amendments.",
      "Republican South Dakota state Rep. Brandei Schaefbauer was among those who encouraged voters to turn down the measure.",
      "Schaefbauer said she supports referring to officeholders as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d but opposes gender-neutral references.",
      "\u201cThat is one of my biggest oppositions to this,\u201d Schaefbauer said. \u201cWe are male and female, and when this was gender-neutralized in the constitution, it was taking away the personhood and that is not how I live my life.\u201d",
      "Neil Fulton, dean of the University of South Dakota School of Law, said that masculine pronouns have long been understood to encompass all people and its usage in the state constitution reflects the drafting convention at the time.",

We have a female governor and we\u2019ve had a variety of statewide female elected officials previously. And no one\u2019s ever challenged that, so it would not have worked substantive change.\u201d",

      "On Wednesday, chief executive Thomas Woldbye will unveil funding to increase capacity at terminals two and five, reconfigure the airfield and improve bus connections.",
      "The plans, which will be paid for with private cash, come after Chancellor Rachel Reeves backed a third runway at the UK's largest airport last month as part of efforts to grow the UK economy.",
      "During his speech at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, Mr Woldbye will also sign a pact to use of the company's steel to build new infrastructure.",
      "The commitment to use UK-made steel comes amid concern in the industry over the impact of tariffs being placed on imports of the metal to the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "The US import taxes could lead to excess steel being offloaded to the UK at cheaper prices, with the potential to undercut domestic businesses.",
      "While the detailed plans for a third runway at the UK's largest airport, are yet to be finalised, the construction of terminal five, which opened in 2008, required some 80,000 tonnes of steel.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr Woldbye will outline the expansion plan ahead of the new runway, which will see upgrades to terminal buildings to \"enhance passenger experience and improve resilience and sustainability\".",
      "\"This privately funded programme will upgrade existing infrastructure while laying the groundwork for a third runway, boosting UK investment and economic growth, with tangible benefits felt this year,\" he will say.",

      "Heathrow's third runway can be built in 10 years, Reeves says",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "The expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial and faces opposition from environmental groups, some politicians, local authorities and nearby residents.",
      "Some have argued that it will take much longer than a decade for a third runway to become reality.",
      "A formal planning process has to take place, which could take between 18 months and two years. Any judicial review of the plan could take another year and a half, while actually building it could take about seven years.",
      "Reeves has said she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" before 2029 and planes to start using the runway by 2035, but Mr Woldbye has previously warned the project would take years and need \"Churchillian resolve\" to deliver.",
      "In his speech, the Heathrow boss will say the airport's expansion plans will be carried out with \"strict environmental safeguards\"",
      "\"This project can only go ahead if we meet the rules on noise, air quality and carbon... it's as simple as that,\" he will add.",

      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and provides a key avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is strained: last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit. A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000."

      "An international law firm has blocked general access to several artificial intelligence (AI) tools after it found a \"significant increase in usage\" by its staff.",
      "In an email seen by the BBC, a senior director of Hill Dickinson, which employs more than a thousand people in the UK, warned staff of the use of AI tools.",
      "The firm said much of the usage was not in line with its AI policy, and going forward the firm would only allow staff to access the tools via a request process.",
      "A spokesperson from the Information Commissioner's Office - the UK's data watchdog - told BBC News that firms should not discourage the use of AI in work.",
      "The spokesperson added:  \"With AI offering people countless ways to work more efficiently and effectively, the answer cannot be for organisations to outlaw the use of AI and drive staff to use it under the radar.",
      "\"Instead, companies need to offer their staff AI tools that meet their organisational policies and data protection obligations.\"",
      "In the email, Hill Dickinson's chief technology officer said the law firm had detected more than 32,000 hits to the popular chatbot ChatGPT over a seven-day period in January and February.",
      "During the same timeframe, there were also more than 3,000 hits to the Chinese AI service DeepSeek, which was recently banned from Australian government devices over security concerns.",
      "It also highlighted almost 50,000 hits to Grammarly, the writing assistance tool.",
      "However, it is not clear on how many occasions staff visited ChatGPT, DeepSeek, or Grammarly, or how many staff visited repeatedly, as several hits could have been generated by a user during every time they used the websites.",
      "The email to Hill Dickinson employees said: \"We have been monitoring usage of Al tools, particularly publicly available generative Al solutions, and have noticed a significant increase in usage of, and uploading of files to, such tools.\"",
      "'Positively embrace' use of AI",
      "Hill Dickinson, who have offices in several parts of England and abroad, later told BBC News: \"Like many law firms, we are aiming to positively embrace the use of AI tools to enhance our capabilities while always ensuring safe and proper use by our people and for our clients.\"",
      "The firm added that its AI policy, which includes guidance that prohibits the uploading of client information and requires staff to verify the accuracy of the large language models' responses, will ensure that usage \"will remain safe, secure and effective\".",
      "The firm is now only granting access to AI tools via a request process. It is understood that some requests have already been received and approved.",
      "A spokesperson from the Solicitors Regulation Authority, which regulates solicitors in England and Wales, told BBC News: \"Despite this increased interest in new technology, there remains a lack of digital skills across all sectors in the UK.",
      "\"This could present a risk for firms and consumers if legal practitioners do not fully understand the new technology that is implemented.\"",

      "Many in the industry are calling on Britain to join the EU and Canada who have said they will hit back against the policy announced by US President Donald Trump on Monday.",
      "The tariffs, set to apply from 12 March, would mean any steel or aluminium coming into the US would be subject to an import tax worth 25% of its value.",
      "The US is the world's largest importer of steel, counting Canada, Brazil and Mexico as its top three suppliers, and Trump sees imposing tariffs, which will be paid by companies bringing the the metal into the US, as a way of shifting away from foreign imports and boosting domestic steel production.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "Gareth Stace, director general of the industry body UK Steel, said Trump had taken a \"sledgehammer to free trade with huge ramifications for the steel sector in the UK and across the world\" as he called for \"stronger action\" from the government.",
      "\"Our high-quality products serve key US industries, many of which cannot source these domestically. This is a moment where our countries should work together to tackle global steel overproduction, not to be at loggerheads,\" he added.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This is because if other countries are no longer exporting to the US, they may look to offload their steel at a cheaper price, potentially leading to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",

      "But shadow trade minister Harriett Baldwin said it was \"a moment of great peril for the UK steel industry because the UK has failed to engage with gusto with the new US administration\".",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey urged the government to show \"urgency\" in dealing with the issue and protecting jobs.",

      "When BBC Panorama told the couple about the identity of their landlord, Christine said: \"I'd shake his hand and I'd say, 'please make my house safe'.\"",

      "In Sinead's case, while council environmental health officers said there were problems, they concluded the flat was safe. She then secured legal aid to pay for an independent inspection. It said the flat was \"unfit for human habitation\".",

    "summary": "The Drax facility, which burns wood pellets, is required to report where it sources its wood from.",
    "story": [
      "A UK power station that has received billions of pounds in government subsidies has failed more than once to report it burned wood from primary forests, BBC News has found.",
      "Drax Power Station, which burns wood pellets, is required to report where it sources its wood and whether it is from natural, previously untouched forests.",
      "The company paid a \u00a325m penalty last year for misreporting this data following an investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem and now the BBC has discovered a further year of misreporting that has not been looked at by the regulator.",
      "The company did not deny misreporting its sustainability data but said it is \"focused on implementing the lessons learned\".",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in North Yorkshire, generates approximately 6% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds in subsidies from the government and bill-payers because wood-burning is classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "These are natural forests that have never been industrially logged and lock up and store significant amounts of carbon as well providing key wildlife habitats.",
      "The company says it does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging.",
      "However, public logging records show Drax still sources whole trees from primary forests that are felled by other companies in the province, despite stating in its own sustainability criteria that the company will \"avoid damage or disturbance to high carbon forests\" which \"can be defined as primary forest\".",
      "Modern industrial logging only really began in the interior of British Columbia in the 1960s, which means the areas that have been logged and replanted in recent decades are not yet mature enough for these plantations to be harvested.",
      "Nearly all the industrial logging that takes place in the interior of the province is from \"woodland of native species where there is no clearly visible indication of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed\", the wording used by Ofgem to define primary forests.",
      "Drax was required to report to Ofgem that it had sourced wood from these areas but data obtained by the BBC through environmental information requests shows the company failed to declare any wood from primary forests in the sustainability data it submitted to the regulator regarding its Canadian wood pellets for the year 2020-21.",
      "That year Drax burned just over 1.2 million tonnes of wood pellets from Canada, with a significant proportion coming from primary forests in the interior of British Columbia.",
      "The company did not respond to the BBC's questions about why it had misreported its sustainability data and whether it had misled both the government and the energy regulator over its use of wood from primary forests.",
      "Drax appears to have since reduced its reliance on Canadian wood. The company said that only around 2.5% of pellets used at its power station in 2023 came from British Columbia, predominantly from public forests that have been designated for harvesting.",
      "The company said it \"recognises the importance of sustainably sourced biomass, and we work to ensure our pellets are legally harvested and meet the strict sustainability requirements of the UK, US, and Canadian governments, as well as those of the EU.\"",
      "The UK's current biomass sustainability criteria do not prohibit whole trees from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "The company added that the misreporting previously identified by Ofgem was \"technical in nature\" and \"would not have impacted the levels of ROCs [subsidies] earned\".",
      "According to Ofgem, accurate sustainability data enables the government \"to understand and monitor the extent to which both primary forests and sawlogs are used in woody biomass, which has consequences for carbon emissions and biodiversity\".",
      "Following their investigation last year and Drax's subsequent \u00a325m penalty for misreporting data, the regulator Ofgem said it \"won't hesitate to act\" in the event of further wrong-doing.",
      "However, when approached by the BBC the regulator did not commit to any specific action relating to the further misreporting uncovered by the BBC.",
      "In a statement an Ofgem spokesperson said: \"We thank the BBC for sharing this information which relates to the same issue that was identified in our investigation into Drax.\"",
      "They added that Ofgem is making Drax \"conduct a full independent, external audit of its global supply chain profiling data to satisfy us appropriate processes and controls are in place for the future\" and added: \"If any additional evidence comes to light following the audit, we will investigate again.\"",
      "Drax's current renewable subsidies schemes come to an end in 2027 and the BBC's discovery of further misreporting of sustainability data by Drax comes as the government is expected to announce an extension of Drax's subsidies imminently.",
      "The government says it is carefully considering amending the current biomass sustainability criteria and will issue an update shortly but did not confirm whether it will prevent wood from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"The situation we inherited for large scale biomass generators was unacceptable.",

    "story": [
      "A government decision to scrap tariffs on Chinese e-bikes coming into the UK has been described as a \"kick in the teeth for British manufacturing\".",
      "Border taxes were imposed on Chinese e-bikes following Brexit, keeping the UK in line with the EU, but the Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has accepted a recommendation to lift them on non-folding e-bikes from Friday.",
      "The Trade Remedies Authority, the body responsible for reviewing tariffs, said the move allowing cheaper Chinese imports could save consumers \u00a3200.",
      "But UK-based companies have called the decision \"strange\" saying it's a blow at a \"very scary time\" for the industry.",
      "British based e-bike companies expressed concerns about the impact of a potential \"flood\" of cheap Chinese e-bikes entering the UK.",
      "James Metcalfe and his brother Lyle run e-bike company Volt and have a factory in Milton Keynes.",
      "They previously manufactured their bikes in China, before moving operations to a factory in Poland, and then shifting manufacturing to the UK following Brexit.",
      "\"I think this is an odd decision, and a kick in the teeth for UK manufacturing,\" Metcalfe told the BBC.",
      "\"We brought our manufacturing here with assurances that this [tariffs on Chinese bikes] was a long term change. We've invested a lot in it. We're a small business, family-owned, and trying to do the right thing by building a quality product,\" he said.",
      "The UK was already a very competitively priced market for bikes, with little need to bring in cheaper bikes from China, he added.",
      "\"What's the benefit? I don't see any. The government are saying there'll be savings for the UK consumer, but for years we've been pushing government to put through alternative savings like grants and subsidies for customers.\"",
      "\"Why not do what everyone else has done across Europe? Provide grants and invest in bike infrastructure in the UK,\" he added.",
      "Metcalfe also questioned why tariffs for folding e-bikes from China remained in place.",
      "\"I'm all for protecting the whole industry and I find it odd that they're protecting one small part of it,\" he said.",
      "On Thursday, the government said it had accepted a recommendation from the Trade Remedies Authority to revoke anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese e-bikes of between 10.3% and 70.1%, and taxes designed to counteract subsidies of 3.9% to 17.2%.",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Defending UK industry from unfair competition is important, which is why we've taken the decision to continue protecting UK folding e-bike producers based in the UK, whilst also lowering prices for consumers and importers of other products.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that the government was \"continuing to take action on unsafe e-bikes\" and had recently launched a campaign \"to raise awareness of the risks of dangerous e-bike batteries and scooters\".",
      "'A scary time for the industry'",
      "The UK bike industry has endured a tough few years following a boom during the Covid pandemic, which saw an increase in outdoor exercise and many people choosing cycling over public transport.",
      "Post-Covid sales dropped dramatically, and many companies were left with stock they struggled to shift. A number of companies struggled, including Mercian and Orange Mountain Bikes, or ceased production, such as Islabikes.",
      "David Miall, who runs e-bike company Wisper Bikes, said UK firms had been heavily discounting in recent years to try and attract new customers.",
      "He said the latest move by the government, which he described as a \"very strange decision\", would bring a \"flood\" of cheaper Chinese imports to an already overstocked market.",
      "\"It's a very scary time for the industry right now, and this will cause a lot of trouble for a lot of companies,\" he said.",
      "David's company designs its bikes in the UK, but manufactures them in Taiwan and Portugal.",
      "He said he had already been contacted by Chinese bike manufacturers offering very low prices for their products.",
      "\"They've overstocked too, and they now see the UK as a place to dump their bikes,\" he said, adding that he may now consider focusing solely on fold up e-bikes.",
      "\"I think the government are thinking 'Let's give e-bikes a boost' but this has been badly thought-through by people who don't understand the industry,\" he said.",
      "The Bicycle Association, which represents firms who make and sell standard and fold up bikes, said it was helping its members to respond to the new rules.",
      "\"This is a significant decision and it may take some time for the implications for the UK cycle industry and its supply chains to become clear,\" a spokesman said.",
      "\"We have for example already requested official clarification of the precise definition which HMRC will be using to identify 'folding e-bikes', which are still subject to these measures.\"",
      "What is an e-bike?",
      "Electric bikes - or 'e-bikes' - are an increasingly popular way to get around for hundreds of thousands of people in the UK.",
      "The broad term 'e-bike' is commonly used for any electric-powered bike, but it can actually refer to very different types of equipment which are covered by different laws.",
      "When most people think of an e-bike, they picture what is essentially a normal push bicycle with a small chargeable motor fitted to make it easier for the user to turn the pedals.",
      "But there are also far more powerful electric-powered bikes on the market which are sometimes lumped in with e-bikes - for example, some models can hit 60mph and are designed for off-road riding in rugged terrain.",

      "Fresh from sharing his business philosophy in his 1987 book, The Art of the Deal, Trump went on a tirade against America's trade policies in national interviews.",
      "In an animated interview with Oprah Winfrey before a live studio audience on The Oprah Show, he said he would handle foreign policy differently by making the country's allies \"pay their fair share\".",

One built on the zero-sum belief that allies are freeloaders and that the liberal internationalist approach which had dominated since World War II was weak and foolish in a competitive world. The solution, he argued, was a more aggressive, protectionist trade policy.",

      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",
      "The tariff wars have begun - buckle up",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",
      "Equality",
      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",
      "The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",
      "So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.",

    "title": "How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:43:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The growth is led by a tourism boom, with Spain nearing France as the world's most visited country.",
    "story": [
      "It's a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city's Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies.",
      "Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.",
      "\"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.",
      "\"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\"",
      "Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub.",
      "And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.",
      "By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.",
      "This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy.",
      "\"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.",
      "Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.",
      "\"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds.",
      "That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.",
      "Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.",
      "\"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School.",
      "Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\".",
      "Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.",
      "Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.",
      "At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills.",
      "Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.",
      "\"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\"",
      "The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.",
      "The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.",
      "\"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\"",
      "Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.",
      "Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.",
      "This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.",
      "Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as \"fundamental\".",
      "The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon.",
      "The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern.",
      "Another is Spain's vast public debt, which is higher than the country's annual economic output.",
      "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros warns that this is \"an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU's new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability\".",
      "In addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation.",
      "With an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for S\u00e1nchez's minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth.",

    "summary": "Students explain their hopes for the UK's first Space Systems Degree Apprenticeship.",
    "story": [
      "David Boutflour's background is as far from the glamour of space launches as it's possible to imagine.",
      "The 31-year-old worked in hospitality for nine years, becoming the general manager for a gastro-pub in Cheshire. But it wasn't the real career for him. \"I felt I could do more,\" he says.",
      "Mr Boutflour had been interested in space and aviation from a young age, mentioning Concorde as an early inspiration.",
      "A course at Portsmouth University caught his imagination - the UK's first Space Systems Degree Apprenticeship launched in conjunction with BAE Systems.",
      "To build up funds to help pay for the course, he switched to lorry driving - a move which did not prepare his social circle for his change of direction.",
      "\"Everybody thought I was lying when I said I'd been accepted on this course. They thought I was pulling their leg, going from truck driver to space engineer!\"",
      "The four-and-a-half year course involves on-the-job learning at sites where BAE Systems designs and assembles satellites.",
      "Back at Portsmouth they'll be studying space systems engineering.",
      "The academic side of the course consists of four modules, in thermodynamics, programming, digital systems and maths, all split between lectures and laboratory time.",
      "Mr Boutflour is joined by four others on the paid apprenticeship.",
      "One of those is Alice Overend.",
      "Aged 21, she had already worked on satellite assembly and testing when she applied for the Portsmouth course.",
      "This work involved the ill-fated Prometheus 2 satellites that were lost during a failed attempt to launch a satellite into space by Virgin Orbit in 2023.",
      "This incident made a deep impression on her. \"It was quite surreal, we were all watching the launch in the office and when the coverage ended we just went home.\"",
      "Unsuccessful satellite launches are part of life in the space business. But the Virgin Orbit loss stuck in the mind of other Portsmouth students. It stands for the risk element in space work.",
      "Ms Overend's background in satellite testing has given her a head-start in terms of understanding how a sprawling UK space industry fits together. \"The whole space sector is going in a good direction.\"",
      "She explains the true meaning of \"space systems\" in her world.",
      "\"Systems is about making sure everything is where it should be, such as the satellite weight being precisely right.\"",
      "George Smith is the youngest of the group at 18, and joined the course straight from A levels in physics, maths and engineering.",
      "In his home town of York he and some friends took apart an old lawn mower to build a go-kart out of the parts.",
      "How did the go-kart perform? \"It only wanted to turn to the right, but we learnt a lot about why it wasn't working.\"",
      "Not everything in space exploration goes to plan either, but practical work like this is an integral part of the course.",
      "\"The apprenticeship appealed to me. I find studying and applying the lesson in practice means I learn better. So I was looking at degree apprenticeships and this course was a checklist of everything I wanted to do.\"",
      "Space is an expanding sector and he harbours a desire to get beyond earth's atmosphere one day \"if I can tick all the right boxes to become an astronaut\".",
      "Right now the course is meeting his expectations. \"To say it's a dream come true is cheesy, but I've got in the door.\"",
      "Elizabeth Seward is the head of space strategy at BAE Systems.",
      "Despite her own background as a physicist, Ms Seward thinks people are put off this sector by a perception that it's exclusively for rocket scientists.",
      "\"Space tends to get put on a pedestal. But the truth is we need more people from other backgrounds. A career here is for anyone interested in space, such as project managers or lawyers.\"",
      "The appeal of space is evident at Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University, where Dr Stephanie Docherty teaches orbital mechanics, how a satellite gets on the right path, as part of the aerospace course.",
      "She agrees that specialisation is less important than aptitude in the space sector. \"Employers want a problem solving mind-set. And I have noticed a real appetite from students for more space content in their course.\"",
      "Proposals to build rocket-launching sites in remote locations such as the Shetland Islands mean more positions should open up in the UK space industry in the very near future.",
      "After the grounding of the Space Shuttle in 2011 Mr Boutfleur felt space exploration \"took a step backwards.\"",
      "Now he says the success of Elon Musk's SpaceX reusable launchers is enormously significant.",
      "\"Musk has very much re-ignited the space race\".",
      "All three students agree that the hands-on side of the course is inspiring.",
      "And outside of the space syllabus what do they get up to?",
      "\"Most of us play video games,\" says Mr Smith, with Ms Overend nodding in agreement.",
      "Scuba diving is another popular pastime. \"We all like gaming,\" says Mr Boutflour, \"and scuba diving is good training for working in space.\"",

      "As I write, there are a lot of powerful people around the world preparing to make their way to Paris \u2013 and a sense that many of them are holding their breath.",
      "On Monday, against the sumptuous backdrop of the city's 125-year-old Grand Palais, representatives from 80 countries including world leaders, tech bosses, academics and other experts, will gather for a two-day global summit to discuss current progress, and future goals, for the rapidly-evolving, hugely-disruptive technology that is artificial intelligence.",
      "That might be what's on the official agenda of the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, but there is something else that's breathing fire into this particular talking shop: DeepSeek.",
      "A horse racing fan once told me that the night before a big race, everyone's a winner.",
      "And with China dramatically blowing the AI competition in a new direction with DeepSeek, its super-efficient and super-viral AI assistant, suddenly there's a feeling ahead of the summit that the pole position occupied by the US AI sector, despite its vast wealth and AI infrastructure, might not be quite so out-of-reach after all.",
      "Prof Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, says there is currently \"a vacuum for global leadership on AI\".",
      "Prof Dame Wendy Hall, from Southampton University, agrees. \"DeepSeek made everybody realise that China is a force to be reckoned with,\" says the computer scientist.",
      "\"We don't have to just go along with what the big companies on the West Coast are saying. We need global dialogue.\"",
      "On that front, the timing of the summit could not be better.",
      "Europe also spies an opportunity to make a new bid for the AI crown. One of French President Emmanuel Macron's officials described the summit to journalists as a \"wake up call\" for France and Europe, adding that the bloc must not let the AI revolution \"pass it by\".",
      "Other countries also recognise a potential shifting of AI power in the air. India PM Narendra Modi has confirmed his attendance at this summit \u2013 having not come to previous gatherings.",
      "The US is sending some serious firepower as a defensive signal of its own, including Vice President JD Vance, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, and Google's Sundar Pichai.",
      "Elon Musk is notably absent from the official guest list, but he will undoubtedly have something to say about it all, whether he's there in person or not.",
      "British Prime Minister Kier Starmer is also reportedly staying away.",
      "There have been two previous summits, the first held in the UK and the second in South Korea. A lot has happened since the AI world gathered for the first time, on the steps of the historic mansion of Bletchley House, in November 2023, and promised to try to maximise the benefits of AI while minimising the risks. For one thing, half of the global population has been to the polls since then.",
      "In Bletchley Park, China's Vice Minister for Science and Technology, Wu Zhaohui attended. But there were whispers that he was kept at arms length, on the grounds of national security.",
      "In Paris, by comparison I expect China to be guests of honour. The country is reportedly sending one of its most senior leaders, Ding Xuexiang, a close ally of President Xi JinPing. There's also a buzz around whether DeepSeek creator Liang Wenfeng will join him.",
      "I asked ChatGPT to list some of AI's notable milestones since the South Korea summit of May 2024. DeepSeek did not make the cut.",
      "Of course there is much more to AI than generative AI like both DeepSeek and ChatGPT - tools that create content like text, images, video. It may well be the most widely accessible to us as consumers. But there are also AI tools that spot disease symptoms, model climate change solutions, develop new formulas for drugs - and that will all be in scope in Paris.",

      "DeepSeek vs ChatGPT - how do they compare?",
      "China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger",
      "Furthermore, the David v Goliath narrative around which the story of DeepSeek hangs does merit further scrutiny. The boss of AI firm Anthropic, Dario Amodei, has written a compelling blog about whether DeepSeek really was built at a fraction of the cost of its US rivals.",
      "We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries were amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output \"in the style of\" individual human creators).",
      "But nonetheless DeepSeek succeeded in shaking up the AI sector in a way not even AI itself might have predicted. And it wiped a lot of money off the value of some of the biggest players in the process. It will almost certainly be a huge topic of conversation all around those Parisian conference rooms.",
      "There's one more theme running through the AI Summit that will be worth keeping an eye on.",
      "The first summit had the word \"safety\" in its title. Some felt the event pushed the narrative too hard and terrified people with dark talk of existential threats.",
      "But it hasn't fallen of the agenda entirely.",
      "As a subject, AI safety is a rather broad church. It can relate to any number of risks: the generation and spread of misinformation, displays of bias and discrimination against individuals or races, the ongoing development by multiple countries of AI-controlled weapons, the potential for AI to create unstoppable computer viruses.",
      "Prof Geoffrey Hinton, often described as one of the Godfathers of AI, says these as \"short-term risks\". They might be up for discussion in Paris, but he argued on BBC Radio 4's Today programme last week that they are unlikely to garner strong international collaboration in the long term.",
      "The big scenario which he believes will really pull everyone together is the prospect of AI becoming more intelligent than humans \u2013 and wanting to seize control.",
      "\"Nobody wants AI to take over from people,\" he says. \"The Chinese would much rather the Chinese Communist Party ran the show than AI.\"",

      "Schools across a city are caught up in an increasingly bitter row over repairs, with some telling the BBC they've had to fight to get work done while paying \"astronomical\" charges over 25 years.",
      "The Stoke-on-Trent schools are all locked into a multi-million-pound Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract, meaning they pay a company to keep their buildings in good condition.",
      "The agreement is due to end in October, when schools fear the private firm will walk away, leaving behind a huge repair bill for work not completed.",
      "BBC News has been investigating the row for more than a year, visiting multiple schools in the city, using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and analysing documents.",
      "We can exclusively reveal 42 of the 88 schools involved are now withholding payments to the contract. The investigation also found:",
      "35 of those schools received a letter from Stoke-on-Trent City Council threatening them with legal action in JanuarySchools were also told at the end of January that there was not enough money left to complete all the repairs required before the contract endsNone of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",

      "None of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",
      "The contract was signed in 2000 between Stoke-on-Trent City Council and a firm called Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited (TSSL). It uses multinational company Equans to maintain the facilities.",
      "The contract is the largest of its kind in England and will be among the first PFI deals in the country to expire. After the deal ends, the private company will have no further liability.",
      "What happens next has implications for the expiry of almost 600 similar deals covering schools and hospitals across England.",
      "Stoke City Council said its priority was to get the schools handed over \"safe, warm and dry\", while the main contractor engaged under the PFI contract, Equans, said the buildings had been well maintained.",
      "At Our Lady and St Benedict primary, more than half the children are from families on the very lowest incomes. When the BBC visited the school last month, part of one classroom was cordoned off with hazard tape because plaster was falling off the walls. There was a hole in the ceiling and the wall was damp to touch.",
      "The BBC has seen evidence the school has spent years chasing this and other repairs, which under the terms of the maintenance contract have to be done through Equans.",
      "Head teacher Sarah Clowes says the school's floors and windows are among almost 300 issues staff have identified - but the heating is her biggest headache.",
      "A new boiler, fitted under the contract last summer, broke down when the first cold snap arrived, and the youngest children had to be sent home for three days because the building was so cold. Pupils in Year 6 remained at school, but had to wear their coats during lessons. When the heating broke down again in January, the school was unable to open and all the pupils had to stay at home.",
      "Since the BBC approached Equans for comment last week, the damp plaster has been removed and repairs have begun. The school told us despite further repairs the heating is still not working in every classroom.",
      "A few miles away, at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy, the exterior render on the building is stained green with damp and is coming away in places. Inside, there is a huge stain where water comes through from the roof to the ground floor.",
      "The BBC has also seen evidence of months of delays to fix three pumps that supply the school with water. Only one is working - and if it breaks the school says it will have to close because there would be no clean water for taps and toilets.",
      "BBC News contacted Equans about the issue and the school has since been assured the pumps will be replaced during a school holiday.",
      "Ian Beardmore, chief executive of Newman Catholic Collegiate - a group of six primaries and one secondary in the Stoke PFI contract - describes the charges his schools have been paying for the past 25 years as \"astronomical\".",
      "He says the annual maintenance fee for a plug socket installed in one primary school staff room was \u00a3400, and when he asked for the socket to be removed the school was charged \u00a3500.",
      "Mr Beardmore says there are \u00a31.8m of repairs that need to be carried out across his seven schools, which have been identified in expiry surveys carried out to assess their condition as the maintenance contract nears its end. Some work has already been classed as too expensive or not essential, he says.",
      "\"There's no money, there's no will to do it, and there's no time in order to put these things into place,\" he says. \"It's going to leave us severely out of pocket - and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.\"",
      "The BBC has seen a letter, sent by Stoke-on-Trent City Council to all 88 schools in the Stoke contract, saying it \"remains concerned\" the PFI company \"may not have sufficient funding available to them to complete all of the handback works\".",
      "It will need to \"reprioritise\" work not already agreed, the letter continues, and target repairs which will leave all schools \"in a safe, warm and dry condition\" by the end of the contract.",
      "Schools have told the BBC it is not clear how these priorities will be agreed or by whom. The council subsequently said schools would be consulted.",

      "Investors make \u00a3140m from PFI deals",
      "When something isn't fixed quickly, or part of a school is out of use, these maintenance contracts allow for money to be held back from the private contractor. In this contract, Stoke-on-Trent City Council is responsible for making sure that happens.",
      "However, the BBC investigation suggests little money has been held back, despite concerns from the schools.",
      "The BBC analysed 25 years of published financial accounts for the PFI company TSSL and found \u00a3416,000 had been declared as deductions from the contract since 2014. In most years this was less than 1% of the fees.",
      "Using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, BBC News also found that no money has been passed on to schools for contract failures over the last 25 years.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council told us it was still working through these payments, and they would be paid to schools before October.",
      "The BBC shared its data with Ian Dennison, whose consultancy firm Inscyte is advising the schools fighting to get repairs done in Stoke. His company has worked on PFI school contracts across England.",
      "Mr Dennison told the BBC the level of deductions in Stoke were \"shockingly low\" compared with similar contracts for PFI schools across England.",
      "Time is running out for repairs to be carried out in Stoke's PFI schools and Mr Dennison is not confident the buildings will be handed back in a satisfactory condition.",
      "\"We believe that there's a really serious problem about to emerge around what works can be completed in time,\" Mr Dennison says.",
      "Putting buildings right at the end of contract is part of what the high yearly payments in PFI are intended to ensure.",
      "Inscyte says the expiry surveys carried out for Stoke City Council and TSSL show the total repairs would cost millions.",
      "The use of PFI deals increased significantly under Tony Blair's Labour government as a way of investing in public buildings without the government borrowing money up front. Under the deals, long-term agreements between the private and public sector were made.",
      "In Stoke, the contract mainly covered maintaining existing school buildings, with a bit of new build. Elsewhere, completely new schools were built under PFI.",
      "In 2018, the Conservative government scrapped the controversial PFI model after growing concerns it did not provide value for public money. But around 570 PFI contracts, including many to maintain and update school and hospital buildings, remained in place. Many are now nearing their end.",
      "Five years ago the National Audit Office (NAO) - which scrutinises value for public money - warned of a risk of schools and hospitals being handed back in a poor condition if the final stage of these maintenance contracts wasn't properly managed.",
      "As contracts begin to wind down, the NAO said there is a disincentive for the private companies to spend money before they hand over responsibility for maintaining the buildings to public bodies.",
      "In order to avoid this happening the government says \"expiry health checks\" should be carried out on buildings.",
      "In response to an FOI request, the Cabinet Office confirmed expiry health checks were carried out on Stoke's PFI schools in March 2021 and March 2024.",
      "Their condition was given the second worst rating, \"amber/red\", which means \"major additional work\" was needed.",
      "The BBC asked the council, Equans and TSSL to comment on its findings.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council said there had been a \"large amount of investment to maintain and improve these schools over the last 25 years\", which it claims means they are in a better condition than many schools elsewhere.",
      "The council said recent high inflation had made repairs more expensive, but it would not agree to responsibility for buildings being handed back unless standards set out in the contract were met.",
      "The council said more than half the work by value had been completed, and it was drawing up plans in case not all the work can be finished.",
      "Equans said it has been \"committed to ensuring Stoke's schools have been well-maintained throughout the 25 years of the contract\". It said an average of 28,000 jobs have been completed across the schools every year, with 93% of planned and preventative tasks being completed on time and, for the rest of this year, \"a busy schedule of work for the school holidays was planned\".",
      "Some work on the damaged render at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy is now due to be carried out over Easter, the BBC understands.",
      "Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited said the schools had been maintained \"in accordance with the contract\", adding that many of the school buildings were relatively old when it took over responsibility.",
      "It said \"all parties are working together to deliver the maintenance works by the contract expiry date\", adding that the schools were involved in the sign-off process and it was unaware of any dispute between the council and the schools and \"unaware of widespread issues with quality\".",

      "Laura Fox said Mumba \"is an icon in her own right, I would play her music anytime.",

      "She wrote: \"Those that got it, GOT IT... and those that didn't, that's OK too. It's my art, and I stand by it.\"",
      "Mumba said the panel, apart from Bambie Thug, didn't have the credentials and experience required and were unnecessarily rude to all the finalists.",
      "In a response on Instagram, Donal Skehan said he had \"nothing but admiration\" for the courage it takes to compete.",
      "\"I understand that Samantha's response is personal and comes from a place of deep emotion, something that is entirely understandable in such a high-stakes competition,\" he said.",
      "\"Tearing others down is never a good look, especially when everyone involved has worked to make the process as fair and constructive as possible.\"",
      "Skehan rejected Mumba's claim that the panel lacked the necessary credentials.",
      "\"Each of us was chosen for our experience, insights and passion for Eurovision,\" he said.",
      "\"Everyone on that panel took their role seriously and approached the night with thoughtfulness, integrity and respect for the artists.\"",

      "The 30-year-old is fronting a two-part series with ITV, where she looks into the issue of deepfakes and image-based sexual abuse.",
      "Asked about the biggest challenge in making the documentary, she said: \"I would say obviously the hardest part for me was having to see how widespread my video still is.",
      "\"I have a lot of people messaging me all the time, sending me clips of it. It's always something in the back of my mind, but having to really face head on exactly where it is and how many places it's in was a real struggle for me.",
      "\"The only way for it to be impossible for not only my video but any victim of image-based sexual abuse's video not to be online in the future is for there to be more awareness and for the government and higher-up companies within the internet to get together and face it head on.",

      "\"It is the same feeling of humiliation, a violation of literally being de-clothed without your consent,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The first K-pop boy band with North Korean members aims to debut in the US later this year.",
    "story": [
      "Yu Hyuk was just nine years old when he started begging on the streets of North Hamgyong, one of the poorest provinces in North Korea, nestled along the northern border with China and Russia.",
      "Besides begging, he ran errands for soldiers and sold foraged mushrooms. Sometimes he stole food out of sheer hunger: once he snatched a lunchbox that sat unattended at an underground station. Inside was a scoop of spoiled rice.",
      "This was just \"part of everyday life\" for many North Koreans, he says, adding that his own life was so consumed with survival that it left little room for dreams.",
      "But dream he did. Later on this year, the 25-year-old will debut in the US as a member of a K-pop boy band.",
      "1Verse (pronounced \"universe\") is made up of five members: Hyuk, Seok who is also from North Korea, Aito from Japan, and Asian Americans Kenny and Nathan - all prefer to go by their first names. They are set to make history as the first K-pop boy band to debut with North Korean defectors.",
      "From scraps to rap",
      "Hyuk was born in a seaside village in Kyongsong county and raised by his father and grandmother, after his parents broke up when he was just four.",
      "Later, his mother fled the North to settle in the South and reached out to him in an attempt to get him to join her. But he refused as he was close to his father and did not want to leave him.",
      "Hyuk says his family was \"not extremely poor\" to begin with, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his parents separated. His father didn't want to work and his grandmother was too old, so Hyuk was left to his own devices to survive.",
      "Eventually, his father persuaded him to join his mother, and in 2013 Hyuk escaped from North Korea.",
      "It took months for him to arrive in the South, after going through several countries. He has chosen not to reveal specifics of the route, as he fears putting other future defectors at risk.",
      "Once in the South, he lived with his mother for just a year, before moving to a boarding school with his mum's financial support. However, he struggled to cope with South Korea\u2019s fiercely competitive education system, as Hyuk had barely finished primary school before his defection.",
      "Writing was the one thing he found solace in, he says.",
      "He started with short poems alluding to his past life in North Korea. \u201cI couldn\u2019t openly share what I\u2019d been through, but I still wanted to make a record of it.\u201d",
      "At first, Hyuk believed his story couldn\u2019t be understood by others, but was encouraged by friends and teachers in his school's music club - and eventually found his passion in rap.",
      "Growing up, music had been a luxury, let alone K-pop which was something he had barely heard of. But now, he channelled his thoughts of feeling lonely and of missing his father into music, referring to himself as \u201cthe loneliest of the loners\u201d - a line in Ordinary Person, a rap song he composed as a part of a pre-debut project.",
      "Hyuk graduated from high school aged 20. Afterwards, he worked part-time at restaurants and factories to support himself.",
      "But it was in 2018 when he was featured in an educational TV programme that his luck changed. His unique background and rapping talent caught the eye of music producer Michelle Cho, who was formerly from SM Entertainment, the agency behind some of K-pop's biggest acts. She offered him a spot in her agency, Singing Beetle.",
      "\"I didn't trust Michelle for about a year because I thought she was cheating me,\" Hyuk says, adding that defectors are often targeted by scams in the South.",
      "But gradually he realised that Ms Cho was \"investing way too much time and money\" for it to be anything but genuine.",
      "'I thought North Koreans might be scary'",
      "Kim Seok, 24, also defected and arrived in the South in 2019, though his experience was vastly different to that of Seok's.",
      "Coming from a relatively better-off family, Seok lived close to the border with China and had access to K-pop and K-drama through smuggled USBs and SD cards.",
      "Due to safety reasons, we are unable to reveal much more about his life in the North and how he came to the South.",
      "Both boys were described by Ms Cho as \"blank canvases\", adding that she had never encountered trainees quite like them.",
      "Unlike Aito and Kenny, who had been immersed in music and dance from an early age, Hyuk and Seok were complete beginners.",
      "\u201cThey had absolutely no grasp of pop culture,\" she said.",
      "But their ability to \u201cendure physical challenges\u201d astonished Ms Cho. They pushed through gruelling hours of dance practice with such determination that she was worried they were \u201coverdoing it\u201d.",
      "Apart from music and dance lessons, their training also covered etiquette and engaging in discussions, to prepare them for media interviews.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they were used to questioning things or expressing their opinion,\u201d says Ms Cho. \u201cAt first, when a trainer asked the reasoning behind their thoughts, the only response was, \u2018Because you said so last time'.\u201d",
      "But after more than three years, Hyuk has made remarkable progress, she says.",
      "\"Now, Hyuk questions many things. For example, if I ask him to do something, he'll reply 'Why? Why is it necessary?' Sometimes, I regret what I've done,\" says Ms Cho chuckling.",
      "But what do the other two boys think of their bandmates?",
      "\u201cI was kind of afraid at first because North Korea has a hostile relationship with Japan. I thought North Koreans would be scary, but that turned out not to be true,\u201d says Aito, who at 20 is the youngest of the four.",
      "Kenny, who spent much of his life in the US, adds that there were also small cultural differences that have taken him time to get used to.",
      "\"Korean culture is very [communal] in that you eat together... that was a culture shock [to me]\", he said. \"I usually don't like eating with people, I prefer Netflix in my ear. But their joy comes from being collective.\"",
      "Late last year, the band added a fifth member, Nathan, an American of mixed Laotian and Thai heritage to the group.",
      "They aim to debut in the US later this year - a decision that the label hopes could attract more American fans.",
      "Playing one day - in North Korea?",
      "Dozens of K-pop groups make their debut each year and only a few, typically those managed by major labels, become popular.",
      "So it's still too early to say if 1Verse will go on to resonate with audiences. But Hyuk has big dreams, hoping that it might be possible one day for his fellow North Koreans to listen to his songs.",
      "With human rights activists often sending leaflets and USBs containing K-culture content via balloons and bottles towards the North, this may prove to be less of a pipe dream than it sounds, though Hyuk also has his worries.",
      "To avoid being seen as a vocal critic of North Korea, he refers to his homeland as \u201cthe upper side\u201d in interviews and avoids mentioning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "Kim has in recent years been ratcheting up his crackdown on the inflow of K-culture. Since 2020, the consumption and distribution of such content has become a crime punishable by death.",
      "A rare video obtained by BBC Korean last year, believed to be filmed in 2022, shows two teenage boys publicly sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas.",
      "One academic says it would cause a \"stir\" in North Korea should 1Verse's music become a hit.",
      "\"If a North Korean defector openly embraced their identity and went on to become a world-class activist, I think that would cause a stir in the North,\" said Ha Seung-hee, an academic specialising in music and media at Dongguk University's Institute of North Korean Studies.",
      "But his main motivation, Hyuk says, is to prove that defectors can be a success.",
      "\u201cMany defectors see an insurmountable gap between themselves and K-pop idols. It is hardly a career option for us,\" said Hyuk.",
      "\u201cSo if I succeed, other defectors might be encouraged [to] have even bigger dreams. That\u2019s why I am trying my hardest.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:41:36 GMT",
    "summary": "The star hinted that he might not play his smash hit Not Like Us, but gave viewers plenty to absorb.",
    "story": [
      "\"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue,\" said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Everyone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "But there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\".",
      "But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.",
      "Drake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.",
      "Sunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.",
      "But the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight.",
      "He performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).",
      "Actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.",
      "\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie.",
      "\"That's what America wants, nice and calm.\"",
      "It was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience.",
      "\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe revolution about to be televised,\u201d he intoned at the top of his set.",
      "\u201cThe picked the right time but the wrong guy.\u201d",
      "And whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying.",
      "Early highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.",
      "The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.",
      "Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.",
      "SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.",
      "Not Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\".",
      "He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".",
      "For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.",
      "Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.",
      "And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.",
      "The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.",
      "Many had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake.",
      "On-stage protest",
      "Nonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.",
      "The only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.",

    "summary": "The Today programme presenter said his login details were stolen after he clicked a link in a fraudulent email.",
    "story": [
      "BBC journalist Nick Robinson says his X account was hacked and used to promote cryptocurrency after he was apparently targeted in an online phishing scam.",
      "The Today programme presenter became locked out of his account on X, previously known as Twitter, on Monday night after he clicked a link in an email he wrongly believed was sent to him by the social media platform.",
      "Robinson, 61, said that he was still locked out of his account on Tuesday after his passwords were changed, \"so anything you read today, it won't be me\".",
      "A cyber security expert said such attacks were likely to be opportunistic, with code instead of humans seeking out social media users who have a large number of followers, to exploit them.",
      "The email sent to Robinson was designed to look like it was legitimate, and included a link it said would allow him to review content it claimed had violated X's policies to stop his account being suspended.",
      "But the email address which sent the email did not end with \"@x.com\" or \"@e.X.com\" addresses used by the platform for official communication.",
      "Following Tuesday's Today programme, Robinson said he had fallen for the scam despite having completed online security courses which highlighted tell-tale signs of phishing emails.",
      "He said: \"Why? Because my defences were down - I was tired after a very long day, I was rushing, and the phishing email made me think that if I didn't act fast I'd be in trouble.",
      "\"However, I didn't just fall for it. I tried repeatedly to use the official authentic X site to deal with the problem I was being alerted to, and only after trying again and again and failing did I think 'oh sod it, what's the worst that can happen?'",
      "\"Well now I know. I should have thought the opposite - i.e. if this alleged problem is really serious they'll be in touch again.\"",
      "He added: \"My main mistake was not to check the email address which made clear it wasn't X that were contacting me but a hacker. Everything else looked just like the real thing.\"",
      "Robinson told Today listeners the hack came days after he was \"swamped by critical messages\" from supporters of Elon Musk after he had pointed out a statement made by the billionaire owner of X was untrue.",
      "His Today co-host Amol Rajan had raised the hack, joking that his \"very own tech bro, the mighty Nick Robinson, has finally succumbed to the temptations online, and I see overnight, is launching a cryptocurrency\".",
      "\"This is the big news in Britain, and what listeners want to know, Nick, is how do they invest?,\" he added.",
      "Robinson said his account had been used to make it look like he was launching a cryptocurrency called '$Today' on the Solana blockchain platform.",
      "\"So if you read that, it's complete nonsense, quite entertaining nonsense,\" Robinson told the programme.",
      "He added: \"But there's a lesson learned - don't click on everything you see.\"",
      "Taking over X accounts to advertise scam crypto coins is a common method used by low-skilled cyber criminals to make a quick buck.",

      "At one star-studded gig in Los Angeles in June, which was intended as a show of unity for the West Coast rap fraternity, Lamar played his biggest diss track five times.",
      "Drake sues record label",
      "Fast forward to January this year, and Drake decided to sue the Universal Music Group (UMG) for defamation and harassment, over its release of Not Like Us.",
      "In papers filed in New York, Drake's lawyers accused the record label of launching \"a campaign to create a viral hit\" out of a song that made the \"false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\".",
      "In response, Universal, which has been Drake's label for more than a decade said his claims were not only untrue but \"illogical\".",
      "It also accused the star of trying to \"silence\" Lamar, who shares the same label, by taking their rap battle to the courts.",
      "\"Throughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth 'rap battles' to express his feelings about other artists,\" the label said.",
      "\"He now seeks to weaponise the legal process to silence an artist's creative expression and to seek damages from [Universal] for distributing that artist's music.\"",
      "Super Bowl show",
      "Which brings us to the Super Bowl. A couple of minutes into his half-time show, Lamar said: \"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue.\"",
      "In the build-up to the big event, there had been questions over whether he would, or even could play it, legally-speaking.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric. But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game, as well as the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Taylor Swift, Sir Paul McCartney and Stormzy who were inside the stadium.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who reportedly once dated Drake and whose name seemingly appears in the lyrics of the song in question.",
      "Williams, a Compton kid like Kendrick, performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as the headliner prowled the stage.",
      "In a review of the gig, the Guardian said the Pulitzer prize-winning rapper \"delivered the final blow to his diss track nemesis\".",
      "While over in the US, Variety noted how Lamar had quite literally declared \"game over\" in the battle.",
      "On Monday, Lamar announced a joint UK and Europe stadium tour with SZA, who joined him on-stage on Sunday night, which will take in Glasgow, Birmingham, London and Cardiff from July this year. Drake does not currently have any UK tour dates scheduled for 2025."

      "Cowboy Carter is, obviously, the name of Beyonc\u00e9's latest album.",
      "But \"Chitlin' Circuit\" might raise some questions in your mind.",
      "What's the Chitlin' Circuit?",
      "From the late 1880s until the 1960s, so-called Jim Crow laws enforced segregation against black Americans and saw them treated as second-class citizens.",
      "It meant that they were separated from white people - often prevented from living in certain neighbourhoods, forced to attend different schools and banned from public spaces.",
      "During this era, black musicians and performers created their own network of live performance venues across the United States.",
      "Known as the Chitlin' Circuit, it took its name from \"Chitterling\" - a dish made with pig's intestines popular in the south, where Jim Crow laws were most prevalent.",
      "Venues were considered safe and acceptable spaces for black musicians, comedians and audiences and gave many pioneering performers a platform to hone their craft.",
      "Almost every notable black musician of the time graced the circuit at some point, including stars such as Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, Jimi Hendrix and James Brown.",
      "The circuit was \"tremendously important to the development of black music\", says Mia Bay, Professor of American History at Cambridge University.",
      "\"The black stars of the day would travel the circuit,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "\"It was very important to sustaining the careers of many important black performers - it allowed them to make a living in music.",
      "\"They were on the road all the time.\"",
      "Prof Bay says the presence of the circuit was also \"very helpful to black communities\".",
      "Performers were drawn to \"black vacation spots\" and the theatres at those locations, Prof Bay says.",
      "\"This would in turn help the careers of these entertainers,\" she says.",
      "\"It was one of the more successful segregation-era businesses.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 has often paid tribute to black performers, and Prof Bay feels the singer's Texas roots may have played a role in that.",
      "\"[It] was very much a segregated state, so this would be something that would be a very direct reference in terms of where she grew up and how she thinks about American history.",
      "\"I also think she, in some ways, has a nostalgic reference, because it was such a communal circuit with a lot of performers,\" she says.",
      "The star's latest tour stops off at notable Chitlin' Circuit cities such as Houston and Chicago.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 fan and music history content creator Nat Brown feels that's not a coincidence.",
      "Unlike Renaissance, this tour is smaller with only eight cities being played in total globally, with six of those in the US.",
      "\"It's a very small tour,\" says Nat.",
      "\"Just like it historically was with the Chitlin' Circuit, where you only went to seven to 10 places.",
      "\"And if people were able to see you - great. But most often, people missed out because you blazed through town and went to the next spot.\"",

      "Pop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During the Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",

    "story": [
      "You'll often hear about actors and the role of a lifetime, but for Tom McKay and Luke Dale it's especially relevant.",
      "For the past nine years they've dedicated most of their working lives to two video games - Kingdom Come: Deliverance (KCD) and its sequel.",
      "Added together, the scripts for the role-playing epics set in 15th Century Bohemia run to more than three million words, according to their makers.",
      "It's thought that KCD 2, which came out last week, could be the longest single video game script ever written.",
      "Both actors spoke to BBC Newsbeat about what it was like to be part of such a huge project and working with the game's controversial director.",
      "The original KCD was something of a slow-burn sleeper hit. Its review scores were respectable when it released in 2018 but it wasn't universally acclaimed.",
      "However, it found a passionate fanbase in the months and years afterwards and the appetite for a sequel grew.",
      "KCD 2 arrived to positive reviews and sold one million copies within 24 hours of launching.",
      "The sequel follows the story of Tom's character Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son turned knight, and Luke's character, the impulsive Sir Hans Capon.",
      "It's a sprawling, open-ended game that allows players to carve their own path through it.",
      "This means it's possible to find important characters or items outside of the storylines that revolve around them, and the game will respond to these variable possibilities.",
      "That's something the game's developers have to account for, and something that Tom in particular, as the main playable character, needs to act out over and over again with subtle differences each time.",
      "It meant hundreds of hours of studio time and repeat trips to Prague, where developer Warhorse Studios is based.",
      "He says it was \"one of the most amazing and unusual acting challenges\" he's faced.",
      "\"You would kind of go down one channel of a decision and then come halfway back up and go down another one and then maybe all the way back up to the beginning and back down,\" he says.",
      "\"And that's not an acting challenge that you ever would have in TV or film.\"",
      "The video games industry is secretive, and both Tom and Luke spent three years under a non-disclosure agreement as they made the second game.",
      "\"It was almost like working for GCHQ or something,\" says Tom, referring to the British intelligence agency.",
      "\"You couldn't talk to anyone about it and people in the studio couldn't even talk to their partners in some cases about what they were doing.\"",
      "Tom says he would occasionally bump into fans of the game when he was working on other projects, and would have to dodge the question when they grilled him about a sequel.",
      "He says it was more difficult when he bumped into fans of the game in the Czech Republic, where the game is celebrated as a national success story.",
      "When they asked why he was spending so much time in Prague, Tom admits he had to bend the truth a little.",
      "\"I'd be like: 'I just love Prague. And I come here very often for lots of holidays,\" he says.",
      "Luke says many fans \"gave up hope\" that a sequel was on the way, given the six-year gap between the two titles.",
      "But when the new game was revealed, he says, there was \"this incredible reception and everyone went absolutely crazy\".",
      "It also reignited an online discourse that had erupted around the release of the original KCD.",
      "Daniel V\u00e1vra, the co-founder and creative director of Warhorse, is a regular poster on social media and is quick to answer critics.",
      "He defended the first KCD, when it was criticised for its lack of diversity, as being historically accurate to the time and location of its setting, although there is not universal agreement about this.",
      "At the time he also made public statements against perceived attempts to force diversity into games, saying his upbringing in communist Czechoslovakia had made him an opponent of \"censorship in the name of good intentions\".",
      "This won him supporters among the so-called Gamergate movement, which emerged online in 2014 and is widely seen as a backlash against attempts to make gaming more inclusive.",
      "Members celebrated V\u00e1vra for his outspoken, uncompromising approach.",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 03:47:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Grab your diary and your ice cream - here are Bridget's relatable wisdoms for those trying to survive adulthood.",
    "story": [
      "Your 20s are a whirlwind of bad dates, career crises, and wondering if you'll ever really get your life together.",
      "Enter Bridget Jones, the queen of chaotic charm, who has been stumbling through life lessons since before many of us can remember.",
      "Despite the original Bridget Jones's Diary book being released in 1996 and the film in 2001, it seems the floundering and flawed heroine has captivated the hearts of Gen Z, who weren't born when Helen Fielding's novel was first published.",
      "Fielding says she finds it \"comforting\" that women in their 20s have a real interest in Bridget\u2019s trials and tribulations. At her book signings, she says \"half the audience are Gen Zs\".",
      "From navigating embarrassing work mishaps to realising that self love (and maybe an extra glass of Chardonnay) is the key to happiness, Bridget has been there, done that, and lived to tell the tale.",
      "Ahead of the release of the new film Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy next week, we've been speaking to three women in their 20s about the life lessons the character taught them: Sophie Gwillym from Cardiff, 28, Hannah Booth in Chester, 25, and 27-year-old Sophie Tyler from Yorkshire.",
      "And then there's us - Yasmin and Noor - both fans of the franchise who have a lot to say about it.",
      "When did you discover Bridget Jones?",
      "Yasmin: In the summer before high school, I stole a tattered copy of Bridget Jones's Diary from my parents' bookshelf and read it all in one night hidden under my duvet. To me, it was a bible for adult life, which, being on the edge of puberty and going into year seven, felt like a total must-read. Almost all of it went over my head at that age but one thing stuck with me: Bridget Jones felt like a real woman who, unlike other perfect heroines that featured in many stories that were actually aimed at children, was flawed and nuanced.",
      "Noor: I was at school and I remember my English teacher talking about one of the films. She was refusing to go see it, as she felt the whole premise was completely unrealistic (\"As if such a beautiful, competent woman would be struggling to find love\"). But my older sister was going, so I tagged along and it was love at first sight plus I'll admit I fancied Hugh Grant just a bit.",
      "Sophie T: My best friend and I watched the first film at a sleepover when we were about 14. I think, on reflection, the scene where Bridget sleeps with Hugh Grant\u2019s character, Daniel Cleaver, for the first time probably wasn't appropriate for us...  I do remember thinking she shouldn't have worn the big knickers (but I would've had no idea why), and we giggled through all the adult bits.",
      "What can a 1990s icon teach someone in their 20s about love today?",
      "Noor: Bridget Jones's obsession with Daniel Cleaver was my life in my 20s. I was chasing after bad boys and addicted to the drama, so it was completely relatable. My friends and I were in endless casual relationships \u2013 and that's very Bridget too. Her dating life was the definition of the situationship, before that was even a thing. But what I really like is how she (eventually) realises she deserves better. She teaches us you can find a Mr Darcy who loves you \"just as you are\" \u2013 even if he does wear reindeer jumpers and fold his pants before bed.",
      "Yasmin: Bridget has given us the ultimate guide to getting over a heartbreak: lying on the sofa wearing old pyjamas and eating ice cream out of the tub while you sob to All By Myself. Unlike the Bridget of the early films, today's 20-somethings aren't incessantly checking for answerphone messages but we are guilty of a bit of post-breakup stalking. Even if the tech isn't the same, early Bridget's neurotic tendencies can still teach us that obsessing over someone is rarely worth it.",
      "Sophie G: Bridget isn't a perfect character, and that's OK. You should be loved for who you are and not try to change yourself to fit in with what society thinks you should be - but learning to accept that is a hard task.",
      "Hannah: At first, Bridget is the epitome of a woman who thinks she needs a man to survive but by the end of the first film, she teaches us to value nice, respectful guys and not to tolerate people who cheat (though, admittedly, they shouldn't have made Daniel Cleaver so hot!).",
      "She also teaches us how to work at a relationship, that love is a choice as well as a feeling, and how to be vulnerable and have boundaries at the same time.",
      "What does Bridget's character mean to you?",
      "Sophie T: It comes back to not needing to change yourself in a society that pressurises us constantly to be skinnier, taller, to read more books and be the best at hobbies. Having a character with self-acceptance is so important when we are constantly being pressured to change ourselves.",
      "Yasmin: I love that Bridget embraces her chaotic energy and that really appeals to Gen Z. If she was a woman in her 20s now, she'd definitely have fallen madly in love with the concept of brat summer - instead of Chaka Khan, she'd be blaring out Charli XCX's 365 through her headphones on her morning commute.",
      "Noor: Wear the big knickers. Eating the entire contents of your fridge is OK sometimes. And don't be defeated by a bad hair day!",
      "But, isn't the series a bit problematic for 2025?",
      "Yasmin: Bridget is by no means perfect - her calorie counting obsession feels dated and other characters branding a woman who weighs 60kg fat is jarring. Body positivity may be more celebrated now - in fact, some women would love \"a bottom the size of two bowling balls\" - but being self-conscious about your appearance is a universal feeling that transcends decades.",
      "One thing I will say is that it's hard to feel too sorry for Bridget when she owns her own flat in central London, has a successful publishing and journalism career and doesn't seem to worry about the price of a round of drinks at the pub - it all feels a little less realistic now.",
      "Noor: You could definitely argue the earlier books and films haven't aged well. First of all, there's a noticeable lack of diversity, and way too many sexist jokes. Then you chuck in all that obsessing over being single, and Bridget's fretting over her calorie intake.",
      "Much of that feels out of place in the context of the progress we've made now, but that's not to say it no longer has relevance: one of my friends is considering Ozempic and others still worry about why they've not met their dream partner as they swipe through Tinder and Bumble.",
      "Sophie G: I think if Bridget was created now, some of those more \"problematic\" elements of her character might be changed but that would be a shame, as it's part of her charm.",
      "We all say and do things we kick ourselves for later. And most of Bridget's more problematic moments are the result of pressures women are subjected to in our society. The way Bridget acts feels more realistic than some characters who are the perfect feminist who deals with everything in the best way.",
      "What have you learnt through Bridget about the importance of friendships?",
      "Noor: I don't think I could've got through the numerous crises of my 20s without having a close group of female friends around me, as Bridget does. Nowadays, there are probably fewer Friday pub trips after work, and more meeting up for yoga and spin, but the overall message is the same: choose your friends wisely as they're the ones who will be there when everything else goes wrong.",
      "Sophie T: That friendship will always be there through the ups and downs of romantic life: to laugh at the failures and be there to comfort you when you need it. Bridget's interactions with her friends are the same as mine. We're always catching up over a meal and drink to moan about life - though there's a little less smoking these days.",
      "Yasmin: Find yourself friends that will eat your blue celery soup! Instead of going for drinks at a fancy London bar and getting a black cab home, we often split a bottle of cheap Tesco wine at one of our crammed and crumbly flats. But really, it doesn't matter what you're doing, it's just about having a supportive group of friends who can tell you when it's time to ditch your toxic Daniel Cleaver-esque situationship.",
      "What did Bridget teach you about your career?",
      "Sophie T: Whenever I'm in a work situation where I'm meeting new people, I genuinely always picture the scene from the film where Bridget's trying to introduce people to each other with a fact about the other person and messes it up.",
      "The iconic scene when she tells her boss Daniel she's quitting has also always stuck with me. During times when I've had to deal with sexism in my career and have battled it head on, I'd like to imagine R-E-S-P-E-C-T was playing in the background.",
      "Noor: Don't send emails before proof reading, don't try and use language you don't understand. Oh, and don't sleep with your boss.",
      "Sophie G: It's okay to try something new and put yourself out there, regardless of your age or where you think you should be in your career at a certain point. Bridget's fear of public speaking has definitely resonated with me in the past, but knowing I'll never have to present in front of Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Salman Rushdie is a comforting thought.",
      "Hannah: To be ambitious and aspirational. A successful career is important to a sense of purpose. You can make mistakes and work through them and you can make bold decisions and take risks.",

    "story": [
      "A Palestinian and an Israeli sit in a West Bank village at night.",
      "They wonder aloud whether Basel will ever be able to freely visit Yuval's home in Israel, whether Basel's village will get building permits, and whether they will one day have stability.",
      "For years, the friends have been filming the destruction of houses, a well and a school by the Israeli army after a court order declared Basel's community illegal. They tell each other they hope they will change that reality.",
      "Now, that scene has reached some of the world's biggest stages.",
      "The film it is in, No Other Land, has been nominated for an Oscar and a Bafta for best documentary feature.",
      "It follows the fight over Masafer Yatta, a community of around 20 villages, and the friendship between Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham.",
      "In the film Basel is nearly detained after a protest, his father is arrested, and a soldier shoots a community member in the neck while confiscating a generator, leading to the man's paralysis and death.",
      "\"It's scary because yes, the film is succeeding and people are aware of it, but I don't think there is sufficient action, especially amongst those who have power to change this,\" Yuval told the BBC.",
      "\"I don't have an illusion that films are going to change the world, but I know they can change individuals, and I know that they can be part of a bigger change, and we really need this now.\"",
      "Basel and Yuval created the film along with Hamdan Ballal and Rachel Szor over five years.",
      "Asked about the man who was paralysed, the IDF said its investigation had found no crime. A spokesperson said that during an operation against \"illegal construction\", two Palestinians had grabbed a soldier by his weapon and vest, leading to the shot.",
      "Palestinian eyewitnesses told Israeli media they were not contacted as part of the initial investigation and believed the shot was fired intentionally.",
      "Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Israeli settlements in the territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. They have expanded over the past 55 years, becoming a focal point of violence and conflicting claims over land.",
      "On 7 October 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. That triggered an Israeli military campaign that has killed at least 47,500 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Since then, settler-related violence in the West Bank has increased, with 13 Palestinians killed by settlers, according to the UN.",
      "More than 850 Palestinians, many of them militants, have been killed by Israeli troops in the West Bank in the same period, the Palestinian health ministry says. The UN says 30 Israelis were killed by Palestinians in the West Bank during that timeframe.",
      "In 2024, the UN recorded about 1,420 incidents of Israeli settler violence \u2013 the highest number that reportedly led to casualties, property damage or both, since records began in 2006.",
      "Additional attacks on Palestinians had occurred since US President Donald Trump's return to power, Basel said, and the filmmakers feared it could worsen.",
      "Trump has lifted sanctions the Biden administration had placed on some settlers. The president's ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said Israel has a \"title deed\" to the West Bank and \"there's no such thing\" as occupation or settlements.",
      "When asked on Tuesday whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would make an announcement in four weeks' time.",
      "The debate over Masafer Yatta began in the 1980s when Israel declared the area a closed military firing zone, meaning no one was allowed to live there.",
      "According to notes from a 1981 meeting, then-Israeli Agricultural Minister Ariel Sharon offered the military additional training areas to restrict the \"expansion of the Arab villagers from the hills towards the desert\".",
      "Israel argued residents previously did not live there permanently. The Palestinian population took their case to Israel's Supreme Court, arguing communities had lived there for generations and pointing to a 1945 map showing some villages.",
      "In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Israel and allowed the demolition of homes and expulsion of more than 1,000 villagers.",
      "Scenes from the film show a bulldozer destroying a primary school, a truck pouring mud into a well, and machinery crushing a home as villagers confront the army.",
      "A girl cries, and when her mother is asked if she has any other place to go she says: \"We have no other land.\"",
      "The documentary also records intimate human moments, like when the mother, who moves into a cave, kisses her daughter and tells her: \"You're my love... Tomorrow will be a new day.\"",
      "The film explores Basel and Yuval's friendship as well. Though they are around the same age and share similar values, their inequality is ever-present.",
      "While Yuval can travel freely in Israel and the West Bank, Basel cannot travel into Israel without a permit, as part of what it says are security measures.",
      "In the film, Basel laments that although he studied law, he could only find work in construction in Israel, and when he thinks about it too hard, \"I feel this huge depression.\"",
      "The film does not shy away from the tension created by Yuval's identity, with one Palestinian asking him: \"How can we remain friends, when you come here, and it could be your brother or friend who destroyed my home?\"",
      "Yuval told the BBC he felt \"responsibility for what is happening to Basel's community\" because \"at the end of the day, the fuel in the bulldozers is my tax money\".",
      "Last year, Yuval faced a backlash for his acceptance speech for the best documentary award at the Berlin Film Festival, alongside Basel, in which he criticised a \"situation of apartheid\" and called for a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "US filmmaker Ben Russell, who was there and wore a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf, said he stood against \"genocide\" in Gaza. Israel strongly denies the accusation of genocide.",
      "German Culture Minister Claudia Roth said the statements were \"shockingly one-sided and characterised by a deep hatred of Israel\", while Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner posted on social media that it was an \"intolerable relativisation\" and that \"antisemitism has no place in Berlin\".",
      "Israel's public broadcaster called Yuval's comments antisemitic.",
      "Yuval, who said he received death threats, told the BBC he was \"very angry\" at the label, which was \"emptying this term of meaning at a time when antisemitism is rising on the right wing and on the left wing\".",
      "He said it was \"absurd\" to hear the criticism when most of his family was killed in the Holocaust, adding that learning from this history \"should tell us to fight against dehumanisation\u2026 no matter who is the victim\".",
      "Despite winning several international awards, No Other Land is self-distributing in the US because it has not found an official distributor there \u2013 rare for a documentary which has been nominated for an Oscar.",
      "One of the film's last scenes is from 13 October 2023, when Basel recorded a settler shooting his cousin, whose hands appear empty, in the stomach. In other footage, settlers throw rocks at homes while soldiers watch.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the shooting case was transferred to the state attorney's office, which the BBC approached for comment.",
      "Currently in Masafer Yatta, Basel said settlers have \"unlimited power\" and there is a \"daily level of harassment\".",
      "He said there were three major settler attacks in January, including on a 72-year-old taken to hospital after he was hit in the head with sticks, and around 15 people arrested in the two days before 30 January while grazing their sheep or chasing away settlers' sheep. Israel Police did not reply to a BBC request for comment.",
      "The UK has sanctioned three settler outposts and four organisations it says are supporting violence against West Bank communities. Yuval called on the UK to sanction all settlers, believing that would \"truly be a deterrent\".",
      "A foreign office spokesperson told the BBC the foreign secretary \"has been clear with Israeli ministers that they must clamp down on settler violence and end settlement expansion\".",
      "\"We have regularly taken action against settler violence, including through targeted sanctions, and will continue to do all we can to ensure the rights of Palestinians are protected and that those responsible for violence are held to account,\" the statement read.",
      "Yuval said: \"I really believe there is no other way forward, other than reaching a just, fair political solution where Palestinians can be free, truly free, and our people, both of them, will have security and self-determination.",
      "\"It really makes me angry, not only that my government is going in the other way, but that the world is allowing it to happen for so long.\"",
      "In the film, Basel recalls a seven-minute visit by Tony Blair to his village \u2013 after which Israel cancelled demolition orders there.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 10:53:57 GMT",
    "summary": "It comes after concerns over the High Court's capacity to hear each individual case in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "The assisted dying bill would be strengthened by plans for cases to be signed off by experts rather than a judge, the MP behind the law change has said.",
      "The proposed law for England and Wales currently says a High Court judge must check each person is eligible and has not been coerced into making the decision to die.",
      "But Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP proposing the bill, will suggest replacing this with a panel of experts who would oversee applications.",
      "It comes after concerns were raised over the court's capacity to hear each individual case.",
      "Leadbeater told the BBC adding \"extra expertise\" would improve the bill.",
      "But some opponents have criticised the move as watering down the bill's safeguards.",
      "Conservative MP Danny Kruger - a leading critic of the bill - said while he welcomed the idea of more experts being involved in the process, he questioned whether they would be impartial like a judge.",
      "He said concerns about the court's capacity to hear individual cases was \"a problem for the bill\", which should not be proceeding \"without adequate judicial safeguards\".",
      "Leadbeater said the panel of experts \"would be professional people doing a professional job\".",
      "She said some would say the bill now had \"too many safeguards\".",
      "\"I've had emails saying why are you making this so difficult? Because we must remember at the heart of this is a terminally ill person who wants choice,\" she added.",
      "If approved, the bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "The new proposal will be voted on by a committee of MPs scrutinising the bill. The members were chosen by Leadbeater and the majority support the legislation.",
      "It comes as the committee begins the process of going through the bill line by line.",
      "Labour MP Paul Foster, who voted for the bill at second reading, called the change a \"game changer\" and said he was reconsidering his support.",
      "Foster told the BBC he will now wait until he sees the full bill before deciding whether to vote against it after committee stage.",
      "Doctors must raise other options to assisted dying, MP says",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "How assisted dying has spread across the world and how laws differ",
      "Under Leadbeater's proposal, the panel reviewing each application would be chaired by a senior legal figure, but not necessarily a judge, and would also include experts such as psychiatrists and social workers. Their decision could, if necessary, be reviewed by the High Court.",
      "The panels would be chosen by a Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission, led by a High Court judge or senior former judge.",
      "The commission would oversee all cases for an assisted death and report annually on the number of applications and how many were approved and rejected.",
      "Ministers and officials have been closely consulted on the change, although the government technically remains neutral on the bill. Civil servants are drafting the amendment, which will be published later this week.",
      "Leadbeater argued this was not removing judicial scrutiny but changing it to a \"judge plus\" model.",
      "However, she previously hailed the role of the High Court as part of \"three layers of scrutiny\" that made it \"the strongest, most robust piece of legislation on this issue in the world\".",
      "The committee of MPs scrutinising the bill heard three days of oral evidence from experts two weeks' ago, including some who raised concerns about the proposed role of the High Court in signing off applications.",
      "Retired High Court judge Sir Nicholas Mostyn told the panel he thought it would be \"impossible\" for the High Court to rule in every assisted dying case.",
      "\"You're talking about nearly three quarters of the entire Family Division [Court] doing nothing but this,\" he said.",
      "He added it should be done \"by a panel set up... for each case, a doctor and a lawyer, they have to agree, and they check everything has been done lawfully\".",
      "Leadbeater said she agreed with the need for other professionals to be involved in the checks.",
      "\"This bill already contains the strongest safeguards anywhere in the world, but I promised to give close attention to the advice we have received on how the bill could be made even stronger, and that is what I have done,\" she said.",
      "However, Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, who sits on the committee and oppose the bill, said the version of the legislation initially passed by the House of Commons in November \"specifically gave provision for a High Court judge\" to sign off cases \"and many MPs voted for it on that basis\".",
      "\"So to make this really profound change at this time makes it very, very difficult for the committee to decide whether this is the right thing or not in order to improve the bill,\" she told BBC Breakfast.",
      "More than 300 amendments have been tabled, with more expected in the coming weeks.",
      "Among those to be debated on Tuesday is one tabled by Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon to allow those with a neurodegenerative illness, such as Parkinson's, to access an assisted death with 12 months to live. The bill currently restricts assisted dying to those with a terminal illness with six months or less to live.",
      "Gordon told BBC News: \"This bill is about ensuring people facing painful deaths from terminal conditions can have the choice of how they die.",
      "\"For those with neurodegenerative conditions, in their last six months, it may be too late for them to engage in the process of applying.\"",
      "It is understood Leadbeater does not support expanding the scope of the bill to include those with 12 months to live.",
      "MPs backed proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales in November, by a majority of 55.",
      "However, it will be debated further by the House of Commons and Lords later in the year, and the final version requires the approval of both before it becomes law.",

      "The baby in this case was conceived by syringe injection to a same-sex couple, although Mr Albon claimed to have had secret sex with the biological mother in the back of a car. That's a claim rejected by the judge.",
      "Cardiff Family Court heard that Mr Albon, who is in his 50s, was a \"stranger\" to the child and has only met them for 10 minutes when a few weeks old for a \"one-off\" photo.",
      "Mr Albon applied to the court for parental responsibility, to be named on the birth certificate and changes to the child's name.",
      "Mr Albon wanted the child's non-biological mother to be called \"auntie\" rather than mother, despite the fact she had acted as a parent from birth.",
      "Both mothers said the stress from the legal proceedings \u2013 which took more than two years - had been cited as a factor in the break down of their relationship.",
      "The court heard the biological mother suffered from anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts made worse by the case.",
      "The judgement - made in 2023, but only just published - said Mr Albon claimed he wanted to \"protect the welfare\" of the child when he was actually \"wholly self-centred\".",
      "Judge Furness concluded: \"They chose a sperm donor who advertised that he would leave it up to the mother as to whether there should be any contact.",
      "\"There was evidence from his own social media material that Albon has indicated that to be the position.\"",
      "The court found Mr Albon, who is originally from the United States but has been living in north-east England, started the family proceedings to support his immigration position to stay in the UK. That is something he denies.",
      "\"In reality he is a man who seeks to control,\" added Judge Furness.",
      "\"Women and children appear to be almost a commodity to him as he sets about increasing the number of his children around the globe \u2013 China, USA, Argentina, Australia and UK to name just some of the countries where he has fathered children.\"",
      "The judge in this case found \"no positive welfare benefit in changing the child's name\" and that direct contact between him and the child would not be in the child's best interests.",
      "Neither mother opposed \"letterbox contact\" so Mr Albon can send an annual card or email to be retained for when the child is of an age to understand who it is from.",
      "Mr Albon advertises on social media accounts like Facebook and Instagram and donates through various methods including artificial insemination and more natural methods like sexual intercourse.",
      "In an interview with The Sun last August, he said: \"I've had about 180 live births and I've met about 60 of them.\"",
      "\"I might never see a lot of them, this has to do with the child's mothers relationship\u2026 it's my preference to have some sort of relationship.\"",
      "The non-biological mother said Mr Albon's insistence of having parental rights had been a \"nightmare and a horror story\".",
      "\"She believes that the world needs to know of the risks associated with unregulated sperm donation,\" said Judge Furness.",
      "\"The public and vulnerable women seeking to get pregnant should know that is the case and they risk a similar 'horror story'.\"",
      "The judge said he wanted \"to protect women from the potential consequences of unregulated sperm donorship, generally, but also from Joe Donor himself\".",
      "\"He is a man who intends to continue donating sperm and vulnerable women who are interested in such services should fully understand the risks of becoming involved with him,\" he added.",
      "The way he was giving sperm was unregulated as it was not through a licensed clinic, with no limits on the number of children, mandatory health checks or protection from legal rights as a parent.",
      "UK regulations say sperm from a single donor used through licensed clinics may only be used to create a maximum of 10 families.",
      "Mr Albon has previously spoken about his motive for donating. He claimed he wanted to help create life it was insulting when people said he only did it for sex, did not make any money and was often lucky to break even on travel expenses.",
      "Family Court proceedings are private although under a recent change in court rules  in England and Wales, reporters can attend and report certain information.",
      "Measures have been taken to ensure the child cannot be identified.",
      "Unusually in this case, the guardian acting on behalf of the child made an application that this judgement should be published online and the father should be named.",
      "It was argued that it is important that the public should be aware of the dangers of unofficial sperm donation. Both mothers agreed to publication.",
      "The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) said it was \"always safer to have treatment with donor sperm\" at clinics it licensed, \"where there are laws and guidance to protect and support patients and donors\".",
      "Clare Ettinghausen of the HFEA said licensed clinics were also expected to adhere to the \"10 family limit\", restricting the number of families that can be created with a single donor.",

      "How to use a menstrual cup",

      "They are made from soft, flexible silicone or rubber and, once correctly in place, can hold 20 to 30ml - around two tablespoons - of blood.",
      "They can be removed, emptied, washed and reinserted every four to eight hours, depending on flow.",
      "Different cup models may offer a better fit according to the individual.",

      "Once inserted into the vagina, menstrual cups create a suction seal to stop any seepage of blood.",
      "When removing, users are warned not to simply pull on the stem. Instead, squeeze the bottom of the cup to break the seal and wiggle it off, says physiotherapist Dr Kate Lough, an expert in pelvic health.",
      "She says it may take women a few menstrual cycles to become accustomed to using one, and stresses wearing a cup should not hurt.",

      "If the threads cannot be located, or a woman thinks her coil has moved, manufacturers recommend using additional contraception and seeing a healthcare professional for advice.",

      "She is recording this in a video diary. Blue NHS curtains are drawn around the bed and all her possessions are stacked up in the tiny chaotic space this creates.",
      "Among the piles of boxes and bags sit the dolls she holds to keep her calm.",
      "Thirty-five-year-old Jessie spent 550 days in Northampton General Hospital. For nearly all that time, she was medically fit to leave but finding her a suitable place to go to was difficult.",
      "The BBC has followed her story for more than five months as the NHS trust took costly High Court action against her, to have her evicted from the hospital bed she was occupying.",
      "Jessie was eventually arrested and taken to a care home where she says she feels anxious.",
      "Her story is an extreme example, but it demonstrates the acute pressures faced by a care system coping with more complex cases, the knock-on effect to the NHS, and how the person at the heart of it can feel lost.",
      "North Northamptonshire Council, which is responsible for her housing and care, says it cannot comment because of an ongoing police investigation into Jessie's behaviour.",
      "The hospital says it \"is not the best environment for patients who are not in need of acute medical care\".",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care has told the BBC: \"This is a troubling case which shows how our broken NHS discharge system is failing vulnerable people.\"",
      "Jessie was one of more than 70 people who contacted the BBC after reading about Matthew in Surrey - who would end up spending more than a year stuck on a hospital ward before being moved to a care home.",
      "Most who wrote to us told of their struggles to find the social care they needed, some also faced long waits to get out of hospital.",
      "At the start of January 2025, nearly 13,000 out of the more than 100,000 hospital beds in England were occupied by people who didn't have a medical reason to be there, according to official figures.",
      "For people delayed for more than a week, the most common reasons were a lack of social care available in their own homes, or a shortage of places in care or rehabilitation homes.",
      "Such delays have become normal, say experts.",
      "Jessie's story",
      "It is very rare for a patient to be taken to court by the NHS - Jessie's is only the fourth case since 2006. So how did she come to be arrested in her hospital bed?",
      "She arrived at Northampton General on 14 April 2023 needing treatment for cellulitis, a bacterial infection affecting the skin, which can be serious.",
      "She uses a wheelchair and needs help with all her personal care. She has also been diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder.",
      "Jessie likes games, arts and crafts, and trips to garden centres. She also finds life difficult and can be challenging to those trying to help her. When stressed, she self-harms and can threaten to harm others.",
      "By the end of April, she was ready to be discharged from hospital, but was told she could not return to the nursing home where she had lived for nine years because it could no longer meet her needs.",
      "Jessie - who is unable to work and reliant on benefits - became increasingly isolated stuck inside her hospital cubicle on the six-bedded ward. She says her mental health deteriorated further, people would stare at her and she felt safer with the curtains drawn.",
      "From documents we have seen, and from what Jessie and her mother, Hilda, have told us, it was about a year before she was offered an alternative place by the local council.",
      "Sarah Scobie, deputy director of research at the Nuffield Trust think tank, says patients stuck in hospital for three weeks or more, like Jessie, tend to need a lot of support, and the number of these cases is increasing.",
      "With councils - who pay for most social care - financially squeezed and overstretched, many care homes and home-care providers are only given short-term funding, she says.",
      "It is \"difficult for them to establish services, recruit staff, train staff, invest in a service, if they don't know whether that funding is going to continue,\" she adds.",
      "The government says it is providing an additional \u00a326bn to help \"shift the focus of care from hospital to community, and tackle delayed discharges by improving the links between the NHS and social care\".",
      "It also says a review of adult social care led by Baroness Louise Casey, which starts work in April, will draw up a plan for a fair and affordable care system for the future.",
      "In Jessie's case, legal documents say the council investigated nearly 120 care places. Only one was offered to her.",
      "This was a supported living flat in a nearby town, with two care staff initially present 24 hours a day.",
      "But the town has upsetting memories for Jessie. She finds it too difficult to talk about, other than to say \"bad things\" happened.",
      "She told us she was desperate to leave hospital, but the thought of going there made her feel suicidal. So, she refused the one place offered.",
      "Under the 2014 Care Act, Jessie should be able to express a preference about where she lives.",
      "She has mental capacity, but was assessed by the NHS as needing a professional advocate to support her in this, helping her understand the decisions she is asked to make and to explain her views to others.",
      "Jessie was referred to an advocacy firm by the council, but in June 2024 her case was closed after she asked for a new advocate but then didn't respond to further contact.",
      "The health and care system is \"convoluted, complicated, very bureaucratic\" and it is easy for a patient's voice to get lost, says Caroline Entwistle from the advocacy charity, VoiceAbility.",
      "She believes an advocate can \"take that pressure off the person who's feeling quite overwhelmed\" - but that funding for such services is not keeping up with demand.",
      "The hospital did provide Jessie with mental health support while she was in her cubicle. But she believed no-one was listening to her.",
      "\"I explained all the reasons I wasn't happy with [the accommodation],\" she says, \"but they just went ahead with it anyway.\"",
      "In August 2024, 16 months after she arrived, the hospital started legal action against Jessie to repossess the bed she was in.",
      "She did not really understand what was happening, she says. Neither did her mother. They could not find a solicitor and had no advocate, so the first two hearings went ahead without anyone representing Jessie's views.",
      "The NHS trust argued a patient didn't have the right to choose their placement, and that a hospital bed took up significant resource.",
      "It said it had taken account of Jessie's vulnerabilities throughout and the package of care offered by the council was significant, with staff present 24 hours a day to keep her safe.",
      "A care plan, which detailed the support Jessie needed, was only given to the court at the final hearing. The date suggests the assessment was completed the day before. It also notes that \"Jessie is unable to communicate effectively\".",
      "At the final High Court hearing on 4 October, Jessie attended remotely from hospital. Within minutes she was overwhelmed and had to leave. Her mother struggled to speak for her.",
      "The judge said Jessie could challenge the council's assessment of whether the accommodation and care were right for her, but she could not remain in hospital \"when she does not need a bed there, and has not needed one for over a year, and others do\".",
      "He ruled that Jessie must leave hospital, and said \"we must hope the transition goes smoothly\".",
      "The hospital trust says it is committed to working with \"care partners to provide the best possible care for those in our communities\" in the place that \"best suits their needs\".",
      "The most recent data, from 2020-21, suggests a standard NHS hospital bed costs \u00a3345 per day. Adjusting for inflation, this would mean Jessie's hospital stay is likely to have cost more than \u00a3200,000. We do not know how much the legal action cost.",
      "Ten days after Jessie's final hearing, 18 months after she arrived in hospital, the police arrested her. She spent several hours at a police station before being moved to the flat in the town that holds bad memories.",
      "Police are investigating her for a number of alleged incidents, she told us, including for sending offensive emails shortly before she was evicted in October.",
      "Since moving, Jessie says she has self-harmed and the police have been called on three occasions - once by Jessie, twice by staff.",

    "summary": "After being struck down by winter illness, the BBC's James Gallagher goes in search of ways to boost his immune system.",
    "story": [
      "It is a cold morning in the depths of winter.",
      "And I feel like I've left my sanity as well as my warm clothes in the changing room as I stride out to the edge of a reservoir in my swim shorts.",
      "A brightly coloured chalk sign informs me that the water temperature today is a chilly 3.9C, as one of the regulars tells me this is not cold water swimming, it's \"ice\" water swimming.",
      "How did I end up here?",
      "Well, I've become enthralled by the idea of enhancing or boosting the immune system. My body has been the living embodiment of the \"quademic\" that the NHS spent all winter warning us about. It's been a relentless stream of colds and coughs and one explosive tummy.",
      "Our immune systems already do a fantastic job fighting viruses and other nasties. If I collected all the air I breathed out over the course of a minute it would contain 100 to 10,000 bacteria, 25,000 viruses and a single fungus, according to Prof John Tregoning, immunologist at Imperial College London.",
      "\"You're breathing these things in all the time; there's just a swirling mass of pathogens [organisms that cause disease] in the air,\" he says.",
      "But there's plenty of foods, supplements and activities that are touted for their \"immune-boosting\" properties. Can we dial up our protection?",
      "Can a cold water swim stop you getting ill?",
      "And that's why I find myself wading out and pushing off for a chilling blast of breaststroke.",
      "The icy water is like fire on my skin and all my brain can think of is making it to the pontoon without needing help from the lifeguards.",
      "But studies have shown the adrenaline hit of the cold water does flood the blood stream with infection-fighting cells.",
      "White blood cells \u2013 which could produce antibodies or attack infected tissue \u2013 move out of their normal homes and head out on patrol thinking there could be an infection. So does this mean I'm more protected?",
      "\"Within a few hours that all goes back to normal,\" says Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh.",
      "\"There is no evidence that people who go cold water swimming have fewer colds or fewer infections.\"",
      "Cold water dips and swims: the benefits and risks",
      "Listen: Can you really boost your immune system?",
      "Regular exercise may give you a younger immune system",
      "There might not be the evidence for cold water, but regular exercise may well do the trick.",
      "On average adults get two to three colds per year and children between five and eight, says Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP and expert in evidence-based medicine, at the University of St Andrews.",
      "\"[But] people who do moderate amounts of exercise tend to report fewer viral infections,\" she says.",
      "There is a lack of conclusive clinical trials, but the data we have is \"all pointing in the direction of it being good for you\u2026 but not a miracle cure,\" according to Dr McCartney.",
      "Laboratory studies have suggested regular exercise may slow the ageing of the immune system. Your body's defences are in decline from our 20s onwards, but research on 80-year-old cyclists suggested they had the immune systems of people decades younger.",
      "\"I know the trials have not really been done in high enough quality, but I'm going to be doing a lot of cycling,\" she says.",
      "What about vitamins?",
      "The first thing that springs to my mind is vitamin C \u2013 either by devouring a mountain of oranges or in pill form.",
      "\"It's a no from me,\" says Dr McCartney. Being deficient may impair the immune system, but for the vast majority there is little to be gained from having extra. The same goes for multivitamins, which says Dr McCartney just make \"expensive urine\".",
      "However, the evidence around vitamin D is hotly debated rather than being a firm no. Vitamin D levels dip in winter as it is made when our skin is exposed to sunlight.",
      "\"I think the evidence is pointing towards possible benefits for people who've got respiratory disease and who are very low in vitamin D,\" says Dr McCartney, but there is \"insufficient\" evidence that it would help everyone.",
      "And while you're thinking what you might put in the shopping trolley, the jury is still out on whether prebiotics and probiotics that change the good bacteria in your gut also benefit immunity.",
      "\"I do believe that is a really important area of study, but we are lacking the real world data that would enable you to recommend this,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "She also says echinacea, turmeric and ginger shots are not going to give you an immune boost.",
      "Keep an eye on the clock?",
      "Your immune system's abilities are not fixed throughout the day.",
      "\"Our immune system is most effective in the early morning at around the time we wake up, continues to be highly effective through the early part of the day and then later on in the day it starts to wind down,\" says Prof Riley.",
      "This is why your cold often feels worse in the morning as your symptoms are the result of an immune system firing on all cylinders.",
      "The decline kicks in \"about four or five o'clock in the afternoon\", so you might have better protection if you are vaccinated, or exposed to someone coughing, in the morning.",
      "As the immune system does have this 24-hour cycle, then having  \"a regular daily rhythm\" rather than a mix of late nights and long lie-ins at the weekend \"may well help boost your immune system\", says Prof Riley.",
      "Stop damaging your immune defences!",
      "While we are thinking of boosting our immune system we should also remember there are things that actually increase our vulnerability to infection.",
      "One of the big ones is smoking because it directly damages the lungs so they are a less effective barrier to viruses.",
      "\"If you imagine the lungs like a sieve, smoking will break holes in the sieve, so more can get through,\" says Prof Tregoning.",
      "It also dials up inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation is like a thermostat for the immune system and is a normal part of how the body reacts to an infection.",
      "But \"uncontrolled inflammation is bad for you\" as it disrupts the immune system \"so you may respond less well\".",
      "Obesity is another factor that can increase susceptibility to infections as well as the severity by ramping up inflammation in the body.",
      "\"Both of those things can be difficult for people to stop or to reverse, but they are probably the most modifiable ones,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "Destress if you can",
      "Being constantly stressed raises levels of the hormone cortisol in the body.",
      "Yet, cortisol dampens the immune system which may leave you more prone to infection.",
      "Prof Tregoning says this may be the explanation for why being in nature, going for a walk, spending time with friends \u2013 even cold water swimming \u2013 may have some beneficial effect.",
      "\"You're less stressed, less cortisol, so therefore your immune system is more fit for the role it is trying to do,\" he says.",
      "Prof Riley adds: \"There is absolutely no doubt that being happy, being in a positive frame of mind, has a very, very important effect on our bodily functions.\"",
      "Stress: How to control it",
      "Squirt some salty water up your nose",
      "You have probably seen products in the shop that you can spray up each of your nostrils at the first sign of a cold.",
      "A report in the Lancet showed they do work.",
      "It gave thousands of people either a salt water (saline) spray or a gel-based one. They could use it up to six times a day whenever they felt they were coming down with something.",
      "People who just went about their daily lives without a nasal spray spent an average of eight days being ill during the study.",
      "But that fell to six days in those using a either salt water (saline) or a branded gel-based spray.",
      "Dr McCartney argues that a branded spray would be no better than a normal saline spray.",
      "So can the immune system really be boosted?",
      "If you are already doing all the usual things to look after your health \u2013 not smoking, eating healthily, exercising regularly \u2013 then your immune system is already in the \"best possible condition\" to respond to an infection, says Prof Riley.",
      "\"Can you do anything to boost above being a normal, healthy person? There's just no real evidence that you can,\" she says.",
      "\"But there are things you can do to improve your immunity against particular individual infections and that is to be vaccinated.\"",
      "And maybe instead of spending your money on the latest immune-boosting craze, she suggests thinking about ways of not getting infected in the first place so \"be careful who you socialise with\".",

      "Other hospital employees said they were concerned other wards could \"follow the same fate\" as plans to rebuild and improve Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) and City Hospital were delayed until 2037 at the earliest by the government.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government inherited a \"crumbling NHS\" and the new timeline was \"realistic and deliverable\".",

      "\"We need new pipes badly. Pipe and ventilation issues impact every floor.\"",
      "The pipework in the hospital was built in 1976 and most of the site's \"plant rooms\" share the same pipework as the former pain clinic.",
      "Plant rooms store equipment, like pipes, that keep the building running safely.",
      "Mr Sokora added: \"The equipment in our plant rooms is coming towards the end its life.",

      "The US is the world's largest importer of steel, counting Canada, Brazil and Mexico as its top three suppliers, and Trump sees imposing tariffs, which will be paid by companies bringing the the metal into the US, as a way of shifting away from foreign imports and boosting domestic steel production.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "Gareth Stace, director general of the industry body UK Steel, said Trump had taken a \"sledgehammer to free trade with huge ramifications for the steel sector in the UK and across the world\" as he called for \"stronger action\" from the government.",
      "\"Our high-quality products serve key US industries, many of which cannot source these domestically. This is a moment where our countries should work together to tackle global steel overproduction, not to be at loggerheads,\" he added.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",

      "Tariffs are paid by companies buying from overseas, not to the overseas companies selling to them.",
      "The importing company may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly or to absorb the cost themselves, or simply to reduce imports. Foreign exporters could also decide to cut their prices to protect sales.",
      "Trump introduced similar steel and aluminium tariffs in 2018 during his first term, but many countries, including the UK, were later able to work out exemptions.",
      "The US president has said he will not consider any exceptions this time round, although it seems like he may set this rule aside for Australia.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken on the phone with Trump and that the US leader was considering an exemption.",
      "Trump has also delayed previously announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico, prompting questions of whether the policies will all go ahead."

      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",
      "It says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging."

      "The company did not deny misreporting its sustainability data but said it is \"focused on implementing the lessons learned\".",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in North Yorkshire, generates approximately 6% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds in subsidies from the government and bill-payers because wood-burning is classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "These are natural forests that have never been industrially logged and lock up and store significant amounts of carbon as well providing key wildlife habitats.",
      "The company says it does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging.",
      "However, public logging records show Drax still sources whole trees from primary forests that are felled by other companies in the province, despite stating in its own sustainability criteria that the company will \"avoid damage or disturbance to high carbon forests\" which \"can be defined as primary forest\".",
      "Modern industrial logging only really began in the interior of British Columbia in the 1960s, which means the areas that have been logged and replanted in recent decades are not yet mature enough for these plantations to be harvested.",
      "Nearly all the industrial logging that takes place in the interior of the province is from \"woodland of native species where there is no clearly visible indication of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed\", the wording used by Ofgem to define primary forests.",
      "Drax was required to report to Ofgem that it had sourced wood from these areas but data obtained by the BBC through environmental information requests shows the company failed to declare any wood from primary forests in the sustainability data it submitted to the regulator regarding its Canadian wood pellets for the year 2020-21.",
      "That year Drax burned just over 1.2 million tonnes of wood pellets from Canada, with a significant proportion coming from primary forests in the interior of British Columbia.",

      "The UK's current biomass sustainability criteria do not prohibit whole trees from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "The company added that the misreporting previously identified by Ofgem was \"technical in nature\" and \"would not have impacted the levels of ROCs [subsidies] earned\".",
      "According to Ofgem, accurate sustainability data enables the government \"to understand and monitor the extent to which both primary forests and sawlogs are used in woody biomass, which has consequences for carbon emissions and biodiversity\".",
      "Following their investigation last year and Drax's subsequent \u00a325m penalty for misreporting data, the regulator Ofgem said it \"won't hesitate to act\" in the event of further wrong-doing.",
      "However, when approached by the BBC the regulator did not commit to any specific action relating to the further misreporting uncovered by the BBC.",
      "In a statement an Ofgem spokesperson said: \"We thank the BBC for sharing this information which relates to the same issue that was identified in our investigation into Drax.\"",
      "They added that Ofgem is making Drax \"conduct a full independent, external audit of its global supply chain profiling data to satisfy us appropriate processes and controls are in place for the future\" and added: \"If any additional evidence comes to light following the audit, we will investigate again.\"",
      "Drax's current renewable subsidies schemes come to an end in 2027 and the BBC's discovery of further misreporting of sustainability data by Drax comes as the government is expected to announce an extension of Drax's subsidies imminently.",

      "When Labour lost the 2010 election, rising star Ed Miliband was asked whether Peter Mandelson, who had just published a headline-grabbing autobiography, could play a role in the party's future.",

      "The first political appointee to the role of UK ambassador to the United States in 50 years arrived in DC with a lot on his plate. Even by American standards.",
      "But why did Sir Keir Starmer recruit him, what explains Mandelson's hunger for the job, and how does he plan to charm Team Trump?",
      "\"Peter is supremely political,\" explains a Downing Street source. \"And this is a very political White House. He is a brilliant operator.\"",
      "Lord Mandelson has already moved into the ambassador's vast official residence, recently refurbished at a cost of \u00a3118.8m.",
      "His new life will involve more than Congressional meetings and cocktail parties. He now oversees 800 UK staff in the country many of whom are seconded to the Pentagon and defence bases.",
      "At the embassy, beneath a Warhol portrait of the late Queen, Mandelson has already hosted lunch for General Keith Kellogg, President Trump's envoy to Ukraine and Russia.",
      "This was merely a warm up for the real challenge later this month: accompanying Keir Starmer to the Oval Office to meet President Trump.",
      "My criticism of Trump was wrong, says Mandelson",
      "Peter Mandelson: How the Prince of Darkness became his excellency",
      "Peter Mandelson 'honoured' to be appointed US ambassador",
      "The new president may be erratic and impulsive yet No 10 officials are determined the two leaders will develop a strong relationship despite their differing personalities.",
      "\"The PM will be asking Peter: 'How on earth do I handle this crazy guy?',\" says a former colleague.",
      "\"As an ambassador in the court of Donald Trump you need someone who can tickle him under his chin. Peter will be the absolute fixer and bridge builder.\"",
      "Unlike the imminent turnover of leaders in continental Europe (Mandelson's long friendship with Emmanuel Macron is no longer so helpful), Starmer and Trump are likely to be in office and working together for the next four years.",
      "One official says part of the UK's pitch is about emphasising that both men are winners: \"Our message to him is we won big in July. You won big in November. Let's do business together.\"",
      "Mandelson has regularly provided advice to Keir Starmer in recent years and acted as an unofficial mentor to the PM's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and director of communications Matthew Doyle.",
      "These relationships suggest Downing Street and the US embassy will have an unusually close and constant level of contact.",
      "In an administration where billionaire businessmen have unprecedented influence, Peter Mandelson's contacts from his time as EU trade commissioner, UK business secretary, and via his international lobbying firm Global Counsel is already being deployed. \"He's essentially been a businessman for the last 15 years,\" says a source.",
      "In conversations with Trump, Mandelson could drop the names of numerous mutual friends: he knows Peter Thiel, the right-wing billionaire backer of vice president JD Vance, and Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, who is on the board of Meta.",
      "Mandelson has met Elon Musk, holidayed with Trump's new Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and built a relationship with Mark Burnett, the TV producer behind The Apprentice who is now Trump's special envoy to the UK.",
      "Yet Mandelson's expertise in charming these elites (former President George W. Bush nicknamed him 'Silvertongue'), and his penchant for luxury have also led to problems throughout his career.",
      "\"He has weaknesses,\" says one longtime friend. \"He likes the high life. A lifestyle he can't afford.\"",
      "Peter Mandelson's friendship with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska during his time at the EU provoked questions about conflicts of interest - Mandelson had stayed on Deripaska's yacht. The European Commission cleared him of wrongdoing.",
      "A name Mandelson will likely not drop in Trump's company is that of their late former friend Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Both knew the billionaire paedophile who died by suicide in 2019. Mandelson maintained a relationship with him even after Epstein signed a plea deal in 2008 and served an 18-month jail term for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.",
      "Epstein is said to have referred to Mandelson as \"Petie\". Photographs released in court documents show Mandelson trying on a belt alongside Epstein in a clothing shop, and the pair blowing out candles on a birthday cake.",
      "Lord Mandelson has said he \"deeply regrets\" both ever meeting Epstein and the hurt caused to his many victims, and has also said that he never had any kind of professional or business relationship with him. But in an interview with the Financial Times this week, the diplomat also added: \"I'm not going to go into this\", and swore explosively at the interviewer.",
      "That undiplomatic language was a rare media misstep and contrasts with No 10's expectation that Mandelson will be a far safer pair of hands with journalists than his predecessor, outgoing ambassador Dame Karen Pierce.",
      "\"Karen just wasn't reliable enough for broadcast,\" one senior insider tells me. Starmer aides want Mandelson to regularly appear on US TV, including Trump's favoured channel Fox News.",
      "Dame Karen's glittering career as a diplomat may have meant she had less experience of television, but her expertise in national security and persistence in charming Trump's allies paid dividends.",
      "So much so that Donald Trump's co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita objected to Sir Keir replacing a \"professional universally respected ambo [ambassador] with an absolute moron\".",
      "Dame Karen stood out in the largely male and often stale world of Washington in her colourful tailor-made suits, occasionally complemented with a feather boa.",
      "As she packed her bags, at one farewell event she was presented with a commemorative champagne sabre engraved with the words \"always the Dame of DC\".",
      "Swapping a beltway bon vivant for the so-called Prince of Darkness is, however, a risk.",
      "Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts with clients of Mandelson's lobbying firm Global Counsel, which have included Shell and China-linked companies like TikTok. He resigned from Global Counsel's board last summer but remains a shareholder.",
      "Mandelson has already appeared on Fox News to apologise for his previous criticism of Donald Trump. He said his claims that the president was \"a bully\" were \"ill-judged and wrong\".",
      "Friends say the new ambassador is well aware that even before he arrived in the US capital he had other prominent detractors like Steve Bannon, Trump's former top adviser who called his appointment a \"terrible pick\".",
      "Mandelson's diplomatic strategy so far involves dividing Trumpworld into three groups and approaching them in different ways. The groups are: ideological MAGA (Trump's campaign mantra Make America Great Again), national security MAGA, and the technocracy.",
      "The first of these groups includes Bannon and may be the trickiest to mollify.",
      "\"They want to do as much damage as possible to Starmer and the UK/US relationship,\" says a diplomat. \"And they want to discredit Peter.\"",
      "Mandelson privately considers himself a foreign policy hawk so is more optimistic about his luck with group two: national security MAGA. These officials are more anti-Putin than others in the president's orbit, and they could be helpful when discussing policy on Ukraine, Russia and China.",
      "Group three - the technocracy - should also be open to the ambassador's advances. Mandelson wants the signature policy of his time in Washington to be a technological partnership involving AI and quantum computing.",
      "\"So Western nations and economies retain a technological edge over our adversaries,\" explains one involved.",
      "Before all that, the most pressing priority for the UK is avoiding trade tariffs.",
      "To help smooth the path, Mandelson's team have pointedly decided to frame their interactions with the White House in America First terms.",
      "\"We have a balanced trading relationship with America,\" insists one British diplomat.",
      "\"We'll be demonstrating where the UK partnership adds value to America not just saying 'this is good for Britain'.\"",
      "As the president floats unconventional and controversial ideas, one key UK tactic will be to simply stay out of the President's firing line.",
      "\"We're not getting involved,\" is a regular refrain from Downing Street.",
      "On Monday, Lord Mandelson will present his diplomatic credentials (a formal letter from King Charles) at the State Department.",

      "President Trump appeared to revel in a recent meeting with Prince William, who he said \"looks better in person\".",
      "Trump also insists, without evidence, he was Elizabeth II's favourite president.",
      "One minister jokes that when the prime minister visits the White House later this month he should take \"something from the Buckingham Palace gift shop\u2026 Maybe give Trump a royal family colouring-in book\".",
      "Forty years after he became Labour's director of research and communications, Peter Mandelson is back at the heart of British politics.",
      "As to why he still has the hunger for high office, one friend points to the four years he spent in the political wilderness after resigning from Tony Blair's government for the second time in 2001.",
      "That bruising experience, they argue, left him feeling unfulfilled and desperate to prove himself.",
      "\"He should have been foreign secretary,\" says the friend. \"Instead in those years he sat at home watching his contemporaries and intellectual inferiors on Newsnight.\"",

      "The government is backing plans for nine new reservoirs to ease the risk of rationing and hosepipe bans during droughts.",
      "But some of these are in areas where new data centres are set to be built.",
      "The first of the government's \"AI growth zones\" will be in Culham, Oxfordshire, at the UK Atomic Energy Authority's campus \u2013 seven miles from the site of a planned new reservoir at Abingdon.",
      "The  4.5 sq mile (7 sq km) reservoir will supply customers in the Thames Valley, London and Hampshire. It is not known how much water the massive new data centres now planned nearby could take from it.",
      "The BBC understands Thames Water has been talking to the government about the challenge of water demand in relation to data centres and how it can be mitigated.",
      "In a new report, the Royal Academy of Engineering calls on the government to ensure tech companies accurately report how much energy and water their data centres are using.",
      "It also calls for environmental sustainability requirements for all data centres, including reducing the use of drinking water, moving to zero use for cooling.",
      "Without such action, warns one of the report's authors, Prof Tom Rodden, \"we face a real risk that our development, deployment and use of AI could do irreparable damage to the environment\".",
      "The tech industry tends to be cagey about water consumption. Most UK data centres contacted for this article did not respond to our inquiries.",
      "Data centres use fresh, mains water, rather than surface water, so that the pipes, pumps and heat exchangers used to cool racks of servers do not get clogged up with contaminants.",
      "The amount used can vary considerably depending on a number of factors including the surrounding environment; sites in colder, wetter parts of the world tend to require less.",
      "Dr Venkatesh Uddameri, a Texas-based expert in water resources management, says a typical data centre can use between 11 million and 19 million litres of water per day, roughly the same as a town of 30,000 to 50,000 people.",

      "In Chile, Google stopped building a data centre following concerns about its water use, and it redesigned the cooling system at another in Uruguay following local protests.",
      "In the UK, Thames Water has warned data centres they could face restrictions on use during heatwaves.",
      "In 2022, the company said it would review data centres' water use as it prepared to introduce a hosepipe ban during a summer draught.",
      "But Foxglove, a group of campaigning lawyers, found evidence from Thames Water's strategy documents the following year that the firm still did not appear to know how much water its existing data centre customers were using.",
      "Thames Water declined to comment. It signposted its recent five-year plan, which has been approved by the government.",
      "This states that it has no legal obligation to service businesses, and can choose to restrict or refuse water to commercial customers; but this was written before the government designated data centres as Critical National Infrastructure, meaning they will face fewer planning restrictions.",
      "Thames Water filed an objection to a planning application for a new data centre in a cluster in Slough, near Reading, in 2021.",
      "But other proposals in the area have since succeeded: for example in August 2024 the firm Yondr announced that it would be building its third data centre campus there.",
      "Foxglove CEO Martha Dark said: \"The government must urgently explain how its plans for new data centres will not threaten our long-term supplies of drinking water.\"",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"We recognise that data centres face sustainability challenges such as energy demands and water use - that's why AI Growth Zones are designed to attract investment in areas where existing energy and water infrastructure is already in place.\"",
      "In addition, recent changes made by the water regulator Ofwat would \"unlock \u00a3104bn of spending by water companies\" in the next five years.",

      "His company, which has 300 data centres worldwide, is trialling a new AI tool which analyses operational data and identifies water-saving measures. He says it is predicted to conserve nearly 4m litres of water per year.",
      "Clearly, that is currently an expectation rather than a reality, but Mr Binkley  says it proves that \"AI can drive sustainability as well as technological progress\".",
      "In 2024 the Environment Agency wrote in a blog that by 2050, England alone would need an extra five billion litres of water every day \u2013 it says this is the equivalent of two million wheelie bins-full \u2013 just to serve the population.",
      "But the regulator now needs more data in order to factor in new data centres' future needs.",

      "A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations that energy giant Shell has ignored repeated warnings that a controversial clean-up operation of oil-polluted areas of southern Nigeria has been beset by problems and corruption.",
      "The multinational headquartered in London, along with the Nigerian government, has repeatedly stated that work to clean up oil-contaminated sites of Ogoniland, which kicked off around eight years ago, is going well.",
      "But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (\u00a3805m), has been suffering from a string of issues.",
      "One close observer has described the clean-up project as a \"con\" and a \"scam\" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland in the Niger Delta region continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation.",
      "Shell told the BBC: \"The operating environment in the Niger Delta remains challenging because of the huge scale of illegal activities such as oil theft.",
      "\"When spills do happen from our facilities we clean up and remediate, regardless of the cause. If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities.\"",
      "The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure.",
      "The communities say the spills have left them without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and created serious risks to public health.",
      "Shell, which has been pushing to sell its assets in the West African country to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, has indicated it will defend the claims.",
      "It denies wrongdoing and says spills in the region have been caused by sabotage, theft and illegal refining for which the company says it is not liable.",
      "The BBC has visited the affected areas in the Niger Delta, where Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, discovered the existence of crude oil 68 years ago.",
      "The UN says at least 13 million barrels - or 1.5 million tonnes - of crude oil have been spilled since 1958 in at least 7,000 incidents in the Niger Delta region.",

      "Her family and neighbours only have access to a contaminated borehole, forcing them to buy clean water to use for drinking, cooking, washing and, once a day, flushing, at a cost of 4,500 Nigerian naira ($3, \u00a32.40) - in an area where the average daily wage is less than $8.",

      "It found members of one community in Ogoniland were drinking water contaminated with a known carcinogen at levels more than 900 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. The same chemical, benzene, was detected in all their air samples.",
      "It also found that sites that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claimed to have remediated, were still polluted and the techniques they used did not reach regulatory requirements.",
      "The report concluded that a comprehensive clean-up of the area would take 25-30 years - and it led to the formation of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep).",
      "This was initially established by the Nigerian government in 2012, but no clean-up was started - until it was relaunched by a new government in December 2016.",
      "Hyprep was part-funded by oil companies including the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Shell, which gave $350m.",
      "However, the BBC has seen internal documents that suggest representatives of Shell and of the Nigerian government were warned numerous times of the agency's alleged fraudulent practices.",

      "In a separate leaked report seen by the BBC from the same year, it was pointed out that laboratory results were \"regularly reported with deviations\".",
      "In 2022, the UN wrote to the Nigeria's environment ministry, warning that if nothing changed, the \"extremely poor standards\" of the clean-up would continue.",
      "The BBC has asked Hyprep and the Nigerian government to comment on the allegations but has received no response.",
      "But our investigation has revealed evidence that Shell was aware of the problems.",
      "In a meeting with the British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes of which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledged the \"institutional challenges\" of the clean-up agency and the chance of the refusal of \"future funding\" towards it.",
      "Shell told the BBC: \"Hyprep is an agency established and overseen by the federal government of Nigeria, with its governing council largely made up of senior ministers and government officials, along with five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single Shell representative.\"",
      "This is not the only remediation project in Ogoniland that is alleged to have been botched.",
      "In 2015, Shell agreed to a \u00a355m settlement for a clean-up after two catastrophic spills in 2008 from its infrastructure in the area Bodo.",
      "The company said the clean-up, conducted by the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), which is meant to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and the Bodo community (and is part-funded by the oil giant and Nigerian regulators) has been certified as 98% complete.",
      "However, the BBC visited sites within the area and found crude oil oozing from the soil and floating on waters.",
      "Shell and the BMI insist any occurrences of oil spills in the region are because of theft - known in the industry as \"oil bunkering\".",
      "\"There is a plan to call back the contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard,\" Boniface Dumpe, a director at the BMI, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of their facilities, to ensure that re-oiling does not come from their facilities.",
      "\"But for the areas that have been cleaned. I would think that some responsibility is also for the community to ensure that some illegal activities does not also cause re-pollution.\"",
      "Shell said it takes active measures to prevent oil spills caused by oil bunkering.",
      "The company said: \"We take extensive steps to prevent this activity and the spills it causes including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads.\"",
      "The alleged failings in the oil clean-up come as Shell prepares to sell its Nigerian subsidiary, the SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.",

    "summary": "The findings shed light on a deeply mysterious part of Earth that is key to life on our planet.",
    "story": [
      "The inner core of Earth may have changed shape in the past 20 years, according to a group of scientists.",
      "The inner core is usually thought to be shaped like a ball, but its edges may actually have deformed by 100m or more in height in places, according to Prof John Vidale who led the research.",
      "Earth's core is the beating heart of our planet as it produces a magnetic field that protects life from burning up in the Sun's radiation.",
      "The inner core spins independently from the liquid outer core and from the rest of the planet. Without this motion, Earth would die and become more like barren Mars which lost its magnetic field billions of years ago.",
      "The change in shape could be happening where the edge of the solid inner core touches the extremely hot liquid metal outer core.",
      "The research is published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience. The scientists were originally trying to find out why the inner core may have slowed down to a slower pace than Earth's rotation before speeding back up again in 2010.",
      "Understanding how the Earth's core works is essential to understanding the magnetic field that protects the planet, and whether that could weaken or stop.",
      "The inside of our planet is an extremely mysterious place. The core is about 4,000 miles from the Earth's surface and, despite best efforts, scientists have so far been unable to reach it.",
      "So, to try to unlock its secrets, some researchers measure the shockwaves caused by earthquakes as they ripple through the planet.",
      "The way the waves travel reveals what type of material they moved through, including in the inner core, and help to paint a picture of what lies beneath our feet.",
      "The new analysis looked at seismic wave patterns from earthquakes that repeated  in the same location between 1991 and 2023. That helped to show how the inner core is changing over time.",
      "Prof Vidale, an earth scientist at the University of Southern California, found more evidence to back up the theory that during those years the inner core slowed down around 2010.",
      "But his team also found the evidence of the inner core's changing shape.",
      "It appears to be happening at the boundary of the inner and outer core, where the inner core is close to melting point. The liquid flow of the outer core as well as pull from an uneven gravity field may cause deformation.",
      "Prof Hrvoje Tkalcic from Australian National University, who was not involved in the study, said the paper provides \"an interesting concept that should be explored further\".",
      "He said it could allow scientists \"to make more informed estimates of some important material properties, such as the viscosity of the inner core, which is one of the least known quantities in modern science\".",
      "Over time the liquid outer core is freezing into the solid inner core, but it will be billions of years before it becomes completely solid.",
      "It would almost certainly mean the end of life on Earth, but by then the planet is already likely to have been swallowed by the Sun.",
      "Prof Vidale's work is part of investigations by experts around the world exploring and arguing over what happens in the core.",
      "\"In science, we generally try to look at things until we understand them,\" Prof Vidale says.",
      "\"In all likelihood, this finding doesn't affect our daily lives one iota, but we really want to understand what's happening in the middle of the Earth,\" he adds.",
      "It is possible that the changes are connected to changes in Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"The magnetic field has had jerks at various times in the past few decades, and we'd like to know if that is related to what we're seeing at the inner core boundary,\" he said.",
      "Prof Vidale urged caution about hyping the findings into ideas that the core is going to stop rotating any time soon.",
      "He also added that there are still lots of uncertainties.",
      "\"We're not 100% sure we're interpreting these changes correctly,\" saying that the boundaries of scientific knowledge are always changing and, like many if not all researchers, he has been wrong in the past."

    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",
      "It says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging."

      "Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.",
      "In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.",
      "But on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.",

      "Speaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.",
      "\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "He added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals.",
      "The UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.",
      "But a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",
      "Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.",
      "The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.",
      "Dr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.",
      "\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.",
      "Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.",
      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",
      "But it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.",
      "\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.",
      "His committee recommended that any future contracts be changed to include profit-sharing mechanisms.",
      "The government said that it expected the \u00a321.7bn funding for CCUS to unlock \u00a38bn in private sector investment over the next 25 years.",
      "Mirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 03:10:59 GMT",
    "summary": "January was expected to be cooler than the same month last year, but was 0.1C warmer, which experts are struggling to explain.",
    "story": [
      "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say.",
      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",
      "\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 08:49:58 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has agreed a new subsidy arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station in north Yorkshire.",
    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",

      "The government is committing billions of pounds to an \"unproven\" green technology for reducing planet-warming gases without considering the impact on consumers' bills, MPs have warned.",
      "Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.",
      "In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.",
      "But on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.",
      "What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change?",
      "Nearly \u00a322bn pledged for carbon capture projects",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "\"It is an unproven technology, certainly in this country. And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.",
      "\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "He added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals.",
      "The UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.",
      "But a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",
      "Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.",
      "The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.",
      "Dr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.",
      "\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.",
      "Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.",
      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",
      "But it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.",
      "\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.",
      "His committee recommended that any future contracts be changed to include profit-sharing mechanisms.",
      "The government said that it expected the \u00a321.7bn funding for CCUS to unlock \u00a38bn in private sector investment over the next 25 years.",
      "Mirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.",

      "The government has said they face \"imminent risk\" from rising sea levels, which scientists say are likely to render the island uninhabitable by 2050.",
      "In June last year, most of the residents abandoned this cramped jumble of wooden and tin homes for rows of neat prefabricated houses on the mainland.",
      "The relocation has been praised by some as a model for other groups worldwide whose homes are under threat, but even so, it has divided the community.",
      "\"My father, my brother, my sisters-in-law and my friends are gone,\" says Delfino. \"Sometimes the children whose families have stayed cry, wondering where their friends have gone, he says.",
      "House after house is padlocked. About 1,000 people left, while about 100 stayed - some because there was not enough room in the new settlement. Others, like Delfino, are not fully convinced climate change is a threat, or simply did not want to leave.",

      "On Gardi Sugdub, waves whipped up during the rainy season wash into homes, lapping below the hammocks where families sleep.",
      "Mr Paton says, \"it is very unlikely that the island will be habitable by 2050, based on current and projected rates of sea level rise\".",
      "However, the first discussions about relocation began, more than a decade ago, because of population growth, not climate change.",
      "The island is just 400m long and 150m wide. Some residents see overcrowding as the more pressing problem. But others, like Magdalena Mart\u00ednez, fear the rising sea:",

      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",
      "\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to \"build baby build\", as he announced plans to make it easier to construct mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC the government was going to \"take on the blockers\" and change planning rules so new reactors could be built in more parts of the country.",
      "Sir Keir said he wanted the country to return to being \"one of the world leaders on nuclear\", helping to create thousands of highly skilled jobs and boosting economic growth.",
      "Unions and business groups welcomed the move, but some environmentalists criticised the government, saying it had \"swallowed nuclear industry spin whole\".",
      "Currently, progress building nuclear power stations in the UK can be slow - to get from planning to \"power on\" can take nearly 20 years.",
      "Speaking on a visit to the UK National Nuclear Laboratory in Lancashire, Sir Keir said the process was too long and that changes announced by the government would speed it up.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason if \"build baby build\" was his mantra like US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\", Sir Keir said: \"I say build baby build. I say we're going to take on the blockers so that we can build.\"",
      "He said the government had already changed the rules to allow onshore wind farms and was now acting to ensure \"we can fast forward on nuclear\".",
      "Pressed over whether people who live near nuclear infrastructure could get money off their electricity bills, the prime minister said while this was not part of the announcement the government had already backed the idea of benefits for local communities hosting energy infrastructure.",
      "In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.",
      "Mini nuclear power stations - or small modular reactors (SMRs) - are smaller and cheaper than traditional nuclear power plants, and produce much less power.",
      "However, while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "The plans announced on Thursday mark the first time SMRs will be included in planning rules. A list of the only places a nuclear reactor could be built - made up of just eight sites - will also be scrapped.",
      "Is nuclear power gaining new energy?",
      "How 'green' and safe is nuclear power?",
      "Starmer goes nuclear in hunt for long-term growth",
      "Sir Keir said the plans would improve the country's energy security by increasing the supply of clean, homegrown power.",
      "He added that Britain had been \"held hostage\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin for \"too long\", which has resulted in energy prices \"skyrocketing at his whims\".",
      "The process of choosing to loosen rules on where nuclear reactors could be built began under Rishi Sunak's Conservative government with a consultation in January 2024.",
      "Ministers said Britain is considered one of the world's most expensive countries in which to build nuclear power, and a new Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce will be established to speed up the approval of new reactor designs and stream line how developers engage with regulators.",
      "Conservative shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie said it was \"about time\" Labour followed his party's lead in recognising the benefits \"of stable, reliable, baseload nuclear power\".",
      "But Doug Parr, policy director of Greenpeace UK, claimed the government had not applied \"so much as a pinch of critical scrutiny or asking for a sprinkling of evidence\".",
      "\"The Labour government has swallowed [the] nuclear industry spin whole,\" he said, adding: \"They present as fact things which are merely optimistic conjecture on small nuclear reactor cost, speed of delivery and safety.\"",
      "While the overall cost of nuclear power is comparable with other forms of energy, nuclear plants are extremely expensive to build.",
      "The head of the Nuclear Industry Association, Tom Greatrex, said the changes would give investors certainty and enable them to get on with building new plants.",
      "Gary Smith, GMB's general secretary, said the union has repeatedly said \"there can be no net zero without new nuclear\".",
      "The previous Conservative government gave the go-ahead for a new nuclear reactor on the Suffolk coast - Sizewell C - in 2022.",
      "The new Labour government committed a further \u00a32.7bn to the project in October but a final decision on its future is not due to come until the spending review later this year.",

      "\"This could present a risk for firms and consumers if legal practitioners do not fully understand the new technology that is implemented.\"",
      "According to a survey of 500 UK solicitors by legal software provider Clio in September, 62% anticipated an increase in AI usage over the following 12 months.",
      "It found law firms across the UK were using the technology to complete tasks such as drafting documents, reviewing or analysing contracts and legal research.",

      "Ellen Roome, mother of 14-year-old Jools, said she had been trying to obtain data from TikTok that she thinks could provide clarity on his death. She is campaigning for legislation to grant parents access to their child's social media accounts if they die.",
      "\"We want TikTok to be forthcoming, to help us - why hold back on giving us the data?\" Lisa Kenevan, mother of 13-year-old Isaac, told the programme. \"How can they sleep at night?\"",
      "Asked why TikTok had not given the data the parents had been asking for, Mr Derrington said:",
      "\"This is really complicated stuff because it relates to the legal requirements around when we remove data and we have, under data protection laws, requirements to remove data quite quickly. That impacts on what we can do.",
      "\"We always want to do everything we can to give anyone answers on these kinds of issues but there are some things which simply we don't have,\" he added.",
      "Asked if this meant TikTok no longer had a record of the children's accounts or the content of their accounts, Mr Derrington said: \"These are complex situations where requirements to remove data can impact on what is available.",
      "\"Everyone expects that when we are required by law to delete some data, we will have deleted it.",
      "\"So this is a more complicated situation than us just having something we're not giving access to.",
      "\"Obviously it's really important that case plays out as it should and that people get as many answers as are available.\"",
      "The lawsuit - which is being brought on behalf of the parents in the US by the Social Media Victims Law Center - alleges TikTok broke its own rules on what can be shown on the platform.",
      "It claims their children died participating in a trend that circulated widely on TikTok in 2022, despite the site having rules around not showing or promoting dangerous content that could cause significant physical harm.",
      "While Mr Derrington would not comment on the specifics of the ongoing case, he said of the parents: \"I have young kids myself and I can only imagine how much they want to get answers and want to understand what's happened.",
      "\"We've had conversations with some of those parents already to try and help them in that.\"",
      "He said the so-called \"blackout challenge\" predated TikTok, adding: \"We have never found any evidence that the blackout challenge has been trending on the platform.",
      "\"Indeed since 2020 [we] have completely banned even being able to search for the words 'blackout challenge' or variants of it, to try and make sure that no-one is coming across that kind of content.",
      "\"We don't want anything like that on the platform and we know users don't want it either.\"",
      "Mr Derrington noted TikTok has committed more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) on moderating content uploaded to the platform this year, and has tens of thousands of human moderators around the world.",
      "He also said the firm has launched an online safety hub, which provides information on how to stay safe as a user, which he said also facilitated conversations between parents and their teens.",

      "In October, he told Variety that deepfakes \"can be a form of harassment\" for some people.",

      "The montage of deepfakes, which has been seen millions of times across the president's Instagram, X and TikTok accounts, shows him inserted into a 1980s euro disco hit, an influencer's hair tutorial and the action hero TV show MacGyver.",
      "Videos such as these have been popular of French social media for a while, so this is Macron acknowledging that he has become a meme among some social media circles.",

      "\"Normalising deepfakes in this way should not be encouraged as it continues the difficulty with telling what is real and what isn't, and is ultimately helping to establish what is fact from fiction.\"",
      "Dr Richard Whittle from Salford Business School also warns of the risk of \"normalising\" deepfakes videos, \"both on social media and by scammers\".",
      "He adds: \"It is great to bring attention to this threat, but doing it in a way that shows how easy it is to create deepfakes risks their wider adoption.\"",
      "Prof Philip Howard, president of the International Panel on the Information Environment, says AI is increasingly being used \"in innovative, sometimes playful ways, as demonstrated by President Macron's recent video.\"",
      "But he adds: \"These kinds of videos are often released when the guidelines on public communication are not clear.\"",
      "There has been some debate in the French media over whether Macron should be trivialising deepfake videos when they can be used for harm.",
      "In October, Macron told Variety deepfakes \"can disinform, which can upset our democracies\".",

      "Thames Water declined to comment. It signposted its recent five-year plan, which has been approved by the government.",
      "This states that it has no legal obligation to service businesses, and can choose to restrict or refuse water to commercial customers; but this was written before the government designated data centres as Critical National Infrastructure, meaning they will face fewer planning restrictions.",
      "Thames Water filed an objection to a planning application for a new data centre in a cluster in Slough, near Reading, in 2021.",
      "But other proposals in the area have since succeeded: for example in August 2024 the firm Yondr announced that it would be building its third data centre campus there.",
      "Foxglove CEO Martha Dark said: \"The government must urgently explain how its plans for new data centres will not threaten our long-term supplies of drinking water.\"",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"We recognise that data centres face sustainability challenges such as energy demands and water use - that's why AI Growth Zones are designed to attract investment in areas where existing energy and water infrastructure is already in place.\"",
      "In addition, recent changes made by the water regulator Ofwat would \"unlock \u00a3104bn of spending by water companies\" in the next five years.",
      "The data centre industry argues that modern sites are already more efficient. Alternative cooling methods which do not require much water, such as free air cooling and dry cooling, are evolving.",

      "His company, which has 300 data centres worldwide, is trialling a new AI tool which analyses operational data and identifies water-saving measures. He says it is predicted to conserve nearly 4m litres of water per year.",
      "Clearly, that is currently an expectation rather than a reality, but Mr Binkley  says it proves that \"AI can drive sustainability as well as technological progress\".",
      "In 2024 the Environment Agency wrote in a blog that by 2050, England alone would need an extra five billion litres of water every day \u2013 it says this is the equivalent of two million wheelie bins-full \u2013 just to serve the population.",
      "But the regulator now needs more data in order to factor in new data centres' future needs.",

      "We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries were amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output \"in the style of\" individual human creators).",

    "summary": "Jordan has rejected Trump's proposal for Gaza's population to be relocated to nearby countries.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has once again insisted the US will take control of the Gaza Strip, as he met Jordan's King Abdullah at the White House on Tuesday.",
      "It was their first meeting since Trump announced his proposal to take over the enclave and move its population of two million Palestinians to other countries in the region, including Jordan.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump suggested he could withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt unless they agreed to take in those Palestinians from Gaza.",
      "Jordan, a key US ally in the Middle East, is already home to millions of Palestinians and has rejected the proposal. King Abdullah said after their meeting that Jordan's \"steadfast position [is] against the displacement of Palestinians\".",
      "But speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, with King Abdullah seated to his right,  Trump signalled he would not shift on his idea which triggered global condemnation when he unveiled it last week.",
      "\"We're going to take it. We're going to hold it. We're going to cherish it,\" he said of Gaza.",
      "Trump claimed that \"a lot of jobs\" would be created across the region if a US takeover of the devastated territory were to happen.",
      "\"I think it could be a diamond,\" he said, adding that he now believes the US is \"above\" having to threaten other countries to participate.",
      "King Abdullah sat quietly next to Trump as the president repeated a proposal that would upend decades of established US policy and could amount to a breach of international law, which prohibits the forcible transfer of populations.",
      "Jordan has so far rejected the idea as a fundamental breach of international law, but has quietly expressed concerns about the kingdom's ability to absorb large numbers of Palestinians.",
      "On the possibility of taking in additional Palestinians, King Abdullah said a solution that is \"best for everybody\" would be necessary. He said Jordan would take in 2,000 unwell Palestinian children.",
      "Trump, however, appeared unmoved and reiterated his stance that he expects Jordan and Egypt to play a part in housing resettled Palestinians.",
      "\"I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Jordan. I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Egypt,\" Trump said. \"We may have someplace else, but I think when we finish our talks, we'll have a place where they're going to live very happily and very safely.\"",
      "Egypt has roundly rejected Trump's idea to remove Palestinians from Gaza. Its foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday that the country intended to put forward a plan with \"a comprehensive vision for the reconstruction of Gaza in a manner that guarantees the Palestinian people's continued presence on their land, in alignment with their legitimate legal rights\".",
      "The statement said Egypt had an \"aspiration\" to work with the Trump administration on its plan, but it stressed that any foreign intervention should \"avoid jeopardising the gains of peace.",

      "King Abdullah stressed that the Middle East was largely aligned with this position following his White House meeting. He wrote on X that his conversation with Trump was \"constructive\", but said that his country remained concerned with Trump's proposal.",
      "\"I reiterated Jordan's steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank,\" he said. \"This is the unified Arab position.\"",
      "\"Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,\" he added.",
      "Jordan is already home to millions of people descended from Palestinian refugees who were forced from the land that became Israel in 1948, alongside those whose roots lie firmly east of the River Jordan.",
      "The country has also absorbed waves of refugees from Syria, and is heavily reliant on US economic and military assistance.",
      "The UN has warned that any forced displacement of civilians from occupied territory is strictly prohibited under international law and \"tantamount to ethnic cleansing\".",
      "Trump on Tuesday appeared to dodge a question about that UN warning.",
      "\"We're moving them to a beautiful location where they can have new homes, where they can live safely, where they can have doctors and medical and all of those things,\" he said.",
      "King Abdullah said during the meeting that the matter would be discussed and both sides should \"wait until the Egyptians\" can present their ideas.",
      "The deal with Egypt is believed to be a proposal for the future governance of Gaza, backed by other Arab states as a way to counteract Trump's plan.",
      "While still being formulated, it is thought the proposal could involve a local administration of technocrats drawn from Palestinians in Gaza, without affiliating to factions including Hamas.",
      "Since first revealing the US proposal during a news conference last week alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump has repeatedly doubled down on his plan for Gaza, saying he is \"committed to buying and owning\" it.",
      "In an interview with Fox News broadcast earlier this week, Trump said Gaza's two million residents would be resettled and have no right to return.",
      "\"They wouldn't, because they have much better housing,\" he said. \"I'm talking about building a permanent place for them.\""

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 22:49:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The way medicines are selected for use in public hospitals is under scrutiny after doctors raised concerns.",
    "story": [
      "Public anger in China over concerns raised by doctors that generic drugs used in public hospitals are increasingly ineffective has led to a rare response from the government.",
      "Doctors say they believe the country's drug procurement system, which incentivises the use of cheap generic drugs over original brand-name pharmaceuticals, has led to costs being cut at the expense of people's safety.",
      "But officials, quoted by multiple state media outlets on Sunday, say the issue is one of perception rather than reality.",
      "One report said different people simply had different reactions to medicines and that claims about them being ineffective had \"mostly come from people's anecdotes and subjective feelings\".",
      "The official response has done little to allay public fears over the reputation of drugs in public hospitals and pharmacies. It is the latest challenge to a healthcare system that is already under enormous strain because of a rapidly ageing population.",
      "How did it all begin?",
      "The debate surrounding the use of generic drugs began in December, when authorities announced the list of nearly 200 companies that had won contracts to sell medicines to Chinese state hospitals. Almost all were domestic makers of generic pharmaceuticals.",
      "This intensified in January, when, in a video interview that went viral, the director of a hospital department in Shanghai, shared his concerns about the drug procurement system.",
      "Zheng Minhua cited \"antibiotics that cause allergies, blood pressure that won't go down, anaesthetised patients who won't sleep\" and laxatives that did not clear the bowel as being among the issues that had been encountered.",
      "Dr Zheng's words immediately struck a chord and have been condensed into a social media slogan that has been viewed by millions in the past month - though much of the discussion of the topic has since been censored on Weibo. Many people have come forward to share their own bad experiences with alleged substandard drugs.",
      "\"I underwent intestinal surgeries in 2024, which required me to consume laxatives beforehand,\" one Weibo user wrote. They said the drugs they were given had \"no effect whatsoever\", even after the dose was doubled, and that they had to turn to drinking coffee to help clear their bowel.",
      "The concerns raised over the efficacy of generic drugs has caused distrust and made some people unwilling to use them.",
      "A person on Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like app, said that when hospital doctors prescribed them the generic version of an antibiotic, they immediately went online to buy the \"original\" \"real\" one, since the generic version \"tasted different\".",
      "\"There have been many people catching colds recently. A lot of them might have bought this drug. Quickly send reminders to your friends now and get them to check the brand before buying,\" the user warned.",
      "Some of the most popular posts discussing the procurement controversy have been taken down, though it is unclear by whom. China's heavily monitored internet has a strong culture of censorship by both authorities and users themselves.",
      "In a scathing, now-removed post by popular podcast host Meng Chang, he lambasted the lack of imported drugs in the public sector: \"If this isn't a bottom line, I don't know what is.\"",
      "Public anger has also been focussed on the difficulties of accessing imported drugs that people believe to be of better quality.",
      "In response to authorities' attempt to reassure people of the quality of generic drugs, one Weibo user wrote: \"As long as we are allowed to buy brand-name drugs ourselves, I have no other complaints.\"",
      "How does the drug procurement system work?",
      "It was introduced in 2018 as a way to lower state expenditure on medicines and involves local governments putting out tender processes for around 70% of state hospitals' annual drug requirements.",
      "Various drug manufacturers then compete to offer the lowest prices for drugs to win these lucrative contracts.",
      "This gives an advantage to domestically-produced generic drugs, which contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as original patented drugs but are often several times cheaper to make as they do not include the high costs of research and development.",
      "China has emerged as one of the world's largest players in the global generic pharmaceutical market, exporting both finished products to consumers abroad and key ingredients to foreign companies. At home, thousands of generic drug manufacturers compete to sell their products at competitive prices in the expanding domestic market.",
      "For generic medicines to be eligible for China's procurement process, they have to be tested and determined to be similar enough to the brand-name version of the drug.",
      "Beijing has credited the drugs procurement system with saving millions of residents more than $50bn (\u00a340bn) in its first five years.",
      "But the procurement process has seen some drug manufacturers offer medicines at incredibly low prices. One of the winning bids last December was an aspirin tablet selling for less than one cent.",
      "\"Are drug tablets that cost less than one cent edible?\" became a trending topic on Weibo at the time.",
      "\"The manufacturers that win the bids often set prices so low that they may struggle to produce high quality drugs with the correct ingredients, potentially leading to ineffective medications,\" Stacy Zhang, associate professor at NYU Langone Health, told the BBC.",
      "She added that while the procurement system \"was not designed to restrict access to imported brand-name drugs\", it may still have \"affected their accessibility\".",
      "Questions over data and efficacy",
      "A proposal submitted by 20 doctors, including Dr Zheng, to Shanghai authorities last month stated that \"there are widespread concerns in the industry that procurement prices are too low, prompting unethical companies to cut corners to reduce costs, affecting the efficacy of drugs\".",
      "\"Doctors are helpless because they have no choice, and there is no channel to escalate feedback.\"",
      "A recent article by  Xia Zhimin, a doctor in Hangzhou, has added to the scrutiny. In it, he highlighted what he said was questionable data from the trials of generic drugs on the procurement list - it was identical to the data from the original drug on which it was based. Dr Xia suggested that it could be evidence of fraud.",
      "The National Medical Products Administration responded by saying his findings were due to an \"editorial error\". His article has since been removed.",
      "Adding to quality concerns are counterfeit drugs, which have seeped into both generic and brand-name drugs markets across the world and are notoriously difficult to detect. The World Health Organization has described this a global health problem.",
      "\"To enhance affordability, the introduction of cost-effective generics is essential,\" Kevin Lu, associate professor at the University of South Carolina's College of Pharmacy, told the BBC.",
      "He added that the procurement process needed \"strengthened quality control\" and \"continued improvements in drug approval and manufacturing standards\".",
      "A sector in crisis",
      "The controversy comes at a time when China's healthcare system is already under mounting pressure.",
      "A rapidly ageing population has meant that the country's total health expenditure has increased nearly 20-fold over the last 20 years, reaching 9 trillion yuan ($1.25 trillion; \u00a31 trillion) in 2023.",
      "Across the country, public medical insurance funds are running thin. Deficits have already appeared in some provinces, where local governments that had relied heavily on land sales for revenue are now struggling with debt as a real estate crisis engulfs China's economy.",
      "At the same time, the healthcare system has been experiencing a trust crisis. Violent attacks against medical staff have risen since the 2000s, fuelled by anger at the lack of resources and an erosion of faith in doctors.",
      "Unlike issues that have been deemed politically sensitive and heavily censored by authorities, such as the persecution of political dissidents or the suppression of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the ongoing controversy surrounding the procurement of drugs has at least been acknowledged by the state as a problem to be tackled.",
      "The National Healthcare Security Administration said in a statement on 19 January that authorities \"attached great importance\" to these safety concerns and would seek feedback on the drug procurement policy.",
      "\"It is undeniable that the national centralised procurement is still in its infancy. There are many pharmaceutical companies with varying production quality,\" state media Life Times quoted a public health scholar as saying. Other experts cited in the article called for drug evaluation standards to be improved.",
      "As authorities try to remedy the procurement system's faltering image, all the scrutiny is now overshadowing a system designed to be a win-win: saving lives and also saving money.",
      "As one Weibo user argued, the savings from lower drug prices are but \"a drop in a bucket\" of China's national healthcare costs. On the other hand, they wrote, allowing potentially defective drugs to be widely used is akin to \"drinking poison to quench thirst\".",

That familiarity has been on display since Trump's inauguration last month: Delhi has publicly signalled its willingness to lower tariffs, take back undocumented Indian immigrants and buy American oil.",
      "It has already lowered some tariffs and taken back 104 undocumented Indians, with the first plane arriving in India last week. These pre-emptive steps are meant to prevent Trump from making specific demands of India and to reduce the likelihood of tensions with the new Trump administration.",
      "Still, Trump may ask Modi to make additional tariff reductions, to further chip away at a US goods and services trade deficit with India that has approached $46bn (\u00a337.10bn) in recent years. But an obstacle could become an opportunity: Modi may call on Trump to enter into bilateral talks on an economic partnership accord meant to reduce tariffs on both sides.",
      "In recent years, Delhi has shown a growing willingness to pursue trade deals. The Trump administration may prove to be a more willing interlocutor than the Biden administration, which imposed heavy environmental and labour-related conditions on new trade agreements.",
      "Trump may also ask Modi to take back more undocumented Indians. Given that some estimates put the number at more than 700,000 - the third-largest such group in the US - this will be a difficult and delicate issue for Delhi to navigate.",
      "Last week, India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament that the government was working with the US to ensure Indian citizens were not mistreated while being deported after reports of them being shackled sparked anger.",
      "Trump may also call on Modi to buy more American oil.",
      "In 2021, India was the top destination for American oil exports, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine brought major changes in global oil markets and prompted Delhi to ramp up imports of cheap oil from close partner Russia. The price point will determine how much oil India is willing to buy from the US.",
      "Modi may also come with his own energy ask: invest in Indian nuclear energy. Delhi is amending its nuclear liability law and has announced a new nuclear energy mission, in an attempt to sharpen international interest in the fuel.",
      "India aims to meet half its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030. Asking Trump to invest in nuclear fuel amounts to a potential happy medium: it is cleaner than fossil fuels, but far removed from the solar and wind power that may not strike the Trump administration as an attractive investment.",
      "Technology will probably be discussed as well.",
      "This was a fast-growing space for bilateral relations in the Biden era, thanks to the 2022 implementation of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), which both sides view as a new cornerstone for strategic partnership. iCET is meant to be directly overseen by the two national security advisers - to avoid getting bogged down in bureaucracy - which means they must each be personally invested in it.",
      "Modi will likely seek assurances from Trump and his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that they remain committed to this. Given Washington's focus on countering China by making India a bigger part of tech global supply chains, they probably will.",
      "Also on the tech co-operation front, Modi may make a pitch for Trump to maintain the H-1B visa regime. These visas for highly skilled foreign workers, heavily criticised by some influential Trump supporters, have been awarded to large numbers of Indian tech employees in the US.",
      "Other countries may also come up during Modi's conversations in Washington. Iran could loom especially large.",
      "Delhi is partnering with Tehran to develop a port in Chabahar city - part of a broader Indian strategy to strengthen connectivity links with Central Asia, via Iran and Afghanistan. But last week, the US administration released a presidential memorandum outlining Trump's \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Tehran, which hints at removing sanctions waivers for those conducting commercial activities in Chabahar. Modi may seek clarity on what this means for Delhi.",
      "Trump may also gauge Modi's position on a big foreign policy priority: ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "Delhi has a strong interest in these wars winding down. Modi's position on the war in Ukraine - calling for an end to the conflict without criticising Putin or Russia - echoes that of Trump.",
      "India's special relationship with Russia and close ties with Israel may prompt Trump to see if Modi would want to play a third-party mediator role as well. Modi would probably be comfortable doing so only if the parties are receptive to outside mediation.",
      "But despite some potentially delicate discussions this week, both leaders will want to maintain a positive tone.",
      "In that regard, the Indo-Pacific Quad will be just what the doctor ordered.",
      "Trump strongly backs this group which consists of the US, India, Japan and Australia and focuses on countering Beijing.",
      "In his first term, Trump elevated the Quad's annual meetings to the foreign minister level and Biden elevated them further to the leaders' level.",
      "India is scheduled to host this year's Quad meeting and Modi may invite Trump to Delhi to attend this.",
      "Trump reportedly is not a big fan of international travel but India is a trip he will probably be keen to make - to deepen his personal relationship with Modi and to advance a multifaceted bilateral partnership that extends well beyond the transactionalism that will carry the day in Washington this week.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:01:11 GMT",
    "summary": "The bank ditches a policy that stopped it acting on flotations for firms with an all male, all white board.",
    "story": [
      "Goldman Sachs' international boss has said the bank ditched an internal diversity rule that barred it from advising all male, all white boards on company flotations because it was no longer needed.",
      "The investment bank had pledged that it would only help a business sell its shares on a stock exchange if it had two diverse board members, one of which had to be a woman.",
      "But Richard Gnodde told the BBC: \"That policy was put in place to try and drive a change in behaviour and I think that's happened.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging interview, he also said the UK government needed to get on and start infrastructure projects now and warned that uncertainty over US policy was dampening firms' \"animal spirit\".",
      "Goldman Sachs introduced its diversity policy on boards in 2020, initially mandating that companies who wanted to float had to have one diverse member, before increasing it to two people.",
      "Mr Gnodde said: \"I think what is important is that you have a diversity of views on that board and if you look at these companies they've all embraced diversity, it's moved along.",
      "\"This was a policy from a decade or so ago, I think it has served its purpose.\"",
      "Last December, a US federal appeals court ruled that Nasdaq, the stock market index, could not impose rules requiring companies to have women and minorities on their boards or explain why they did not.",
      "A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said: \"As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy.\"",
      "In one of his first acts after being sworn in, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to end \"radical and wasteful government DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion ] programs\".",
      "A number of companies have since rowed back on diverse hiring programs, including Google and Meta, the firm that owns Instagram and Facebook.",
      "Asked whether firms were stepping back from policies around diversity because of the Trump White House, Mr Gnodde said: \"I can only speak for ourselves, I don't think that's the case.",
      "\"Our ambitions are to continue to take things forward and frankly to go much further than we have been.\"",
      "'Animal spirits'",
      "However, he conceded that uncertainty caused by Trump's policy on trade tariffs was weighing on companies' \"animal spirits\" and their appetite for investment.",
      "\"I think right now, the mood is on the margin [is] a little tempered, because people are uncertain about exactly what the policy outcome will be and exactly what the impacts will be,\" said Mr Gnodde.",
      "Trump initially said he would impose 25% tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. However, he then paused them against Canada and Mexico for 30 days.",
      "Since then, the president has subsequently announced he would impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium entering the US, provoking furious responses from the likes of Canada and the European Union.",
      "Start building",
      "Looking at the UK, Mr Gnodde urged the government to get going on infrastructure  projects sooner rather than later.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves recently announced her backing for a third runway at Heathrow as well as expanding Luton and Gatwick airports, and building a \"growth corridor\" between Oxford and Cambridge.",
      "However, these projects are not expected to be completed for a number of years.",
      "The government has made growing the economy a key policy but UK growth has slowed, according to official figures.",
      "Mr Gnodde said: \"The long range projects are very interesting. We need to put them in place but they're going to take a long time.\"",
      "He added: \"Let's find some infrastructure builds that we need to do, whether it's in the energy sector, whether it's in transportation, improving the road network, something on energy transition.",
      "\"These plans all sit on the Treasury's desk. Why don't we put them out to tender, get the private sector to bid on terms that will be attractive to the private sector, and you will see competition.\"",
      "In a report into boosting small businesses in Britain, released on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said: \"If there are two things we know from the first six months of a new administration in the UK, it is that growth is the pressing national mission and unlocking it is perhaps the greatest challenge that consecutive governments have faced.\"",
      "Mr Gnodde said Labour had \"sent a strong message on the competition front\" after it recently ousted the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority.",
      "He added that the government pulling such a lever could ignite growth to make the UK \"globally competitive\".",
      "He also suggested that UK businesses had to consolidate to compete globally.",

      "Luis Rubiales has told a court he is \"absolutely sure\" Spanish footballer Jenni Hermoso gave her consent before he kissed her at the Women's World Cup final in 2023.",
      "The former president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) is on trial accused of sexual assault and attempting to coerce Ms Hermoso into publicly saying the kiss had been consensual.",
      "Giving evidence, Mr Rubiales, 47, said the kiss was an \"act of affection\", adding that in the moment it was \"something completely spontaneous\".",
      "The incident occurred during the medal-giving ceremony after Spain's World Cup win in Australia, triggering protests and calls for Mr Rubiales's resignation. He denies any criminal wrongdoing.",
      "Mr Rubiales told Spain's National Court in Madrid on Tuesday that Hermoso had \"embraced\" him during the ceremony.",
      "\"I've known her for many years and I kissed her because she was a champion. This was a tremendous moment for her,\" he said.",
      "\"We were champions, we were thanking each other. She pressed me very hard by the waist and then I asked her whether I could give her a kiss and she said yes.\"",
      "He added: \"I took hold of her so as not to fall back.\"",
      "Mr Rubiales was questioned over whether he asked Ms Hermoso for a kiss or a \"little kiss\".",
      "\"I can't remember exactly,\" he replied. \"But I think it was a little kiss.\"",
      "Prosecutor Marta Durantiez repeated: \"Did you tell her kiss or kiss on the lips?\"",
      "Mr Rubiales responded: \"At that moment I did not remember but it is obvious that I said kiss. There are synonyms.\"",
      "Asked whether he normally kissed people on the lips, Rubiales told the court he felt the occasion and the fact he had known Hermoso for a long time warranted it.",
      "He added he would act similarly with a male player, or one of his daughters during New Year celebrations.",
      "He was also asked if he was aware of the protocol against sexual harassment and sexual violence, to which he replied he was aware of it.",
      "A lip reading expert  - called to testify by Mr Rubiales's legal team - told the court that, based on video footage he had anaylsed, the former football boss had asked Ms Hermoso \"can I give you a kiss?\" but that her response was not visible.",
      "The lip reader also acknowledged that he only analysed a video published on TikTok, and was unable to specify who it belonged to.",
      "A second expert, also called by Mr Rubiales's team, claimed the video had not been modified in any way.",
      "According to Spanish media, Ms Hermoso's lawyer asked the lip reader could distinguish between the words \"kiss, peck, pretty or little\".",
      "\"Yes, there would be a difference,\" he clarified.",
      "In her testimony last week, Ms Hermoso insisted that she had not given Mr Rubiales permission and that the incident had \"stained one of the happiest days of my life\".",
      "She previously told the court: \"My boss was kissing me, and this shouldn't happen in any social or work setting.\"",
      "The Spain forward added: \"A kiss on the lips is only given when I decide so.\"",
      "Ms Hermoso said she was pulled aside soon after the kiss and asked to consent to a statement minimising the incident, which she refused to do.",
      "Mr Rubiales then asked her to record a video with him on the flight home because he was being accused of assault on social media, she told the court. She said she had received death threats which prompted her to move her family to Mexico, where she now plays.",
      "Mr Rubiales conceded he had \"made a mistake\" on the podium and that his behaviour \"was not appropriate\", saying he should have \"been in a more institutional role\", but denied any offence had been committed.",
      "He said the media attention the incident has attracted was \"ridiculous\", adding that Ms Hermoso never reprimanded him over the kiss at any point in the immediate aftermath of the incident.",
      "The incident was witnessed by millions of television viewers and an entire stadium after the Spanish women's team won the 2023 World Cup.",
      "The ensuing uproar gave momentum to a \"Me Too\"-style movement in the Spanish women's game, in which players sought to combat sexism and achieve parity with their male peers.",
      "Mr Rubiales resigned in September 2023 following weeks of resisting pressure to stand down, and after Fifa suspended him and Spanish prosecutors opened an investigation.",
      "Mr Rubiales has also denied that he sent someone to speak to Ms Hermoso's family in an attempt to get her to agree to make a video with him to assuage the public outcry.",

      "Proceedings are taking place at a New York state court a few miles from where Sir Salman was attacked on 12 August 2022 as he was about to give a talk on how the US was a haven for exiled writers.",

      "Warning: This story contains distressing details",
      "Prosecutors, who have not specified a motive for the stabbing, called Sir Salman to the stand as the first witness on Tuesday morning, asking him to recall the moments before and after the attack.",
      "The 77-year-old told the jury that on the day in question, he had been sitting on stage ready to address an audience at the prestigious Chautauqua Institution.",
      "It was shortly after Sir Salman was introduced that he said he noticed a person rushing at him from his right-hand side.",
      "He described the attacker as wearing dark clothes and a face mask, and said he was struck by the individual's eyes, \"which were dark and seemed very ferocious\".",

      "Bannon's lawyer said on Tuesday he didn't personally pocket any of the money.",
      "The \"We Build the Wall\" campaign was launched by Bannon and the three others to use donations to build segments of the border barrier - whose construction was a key Trump promise during the 2016 election - on private land.",
      "The four were charged with money laundering and conspiracy after being accused of deceiving donors who had contributed millions of dollars to the fundraising drive in 2019.",
      "According to the indictment, Bannon told donors he was \"kind of a volunteer\" to the We Build the Wall non-profit, which raised more than $25m (\u00a322m) from thousands of people.",
      "Despite his vow that \"not a penny\" would be pocketed by him or others, he diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars to two associates, prosecutors alleged.",
      "Under the agreement, Bannon entered a guilty plea to just the first degree scheme to defraud charge.",
      "The sentence also means he cannot serve as the director of any non-profit in New York or raise money for charities with assets in the state.",
      "\"This resolution achieves our primary goal: to protect New York's charities and New Yorkers' charitable giving from fraud,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement.",

      "Some of his co-conspirators, who did not receive pardons, were ultimately sentenced to prison.",
      "The president's pardon authority applies only to federal matters, and charges in the current case were filed by in a New York State court in September 2022.",
      "Bannon, a former investment banker, was the driving force behind the right-wing Breitbart News website before serving in the Trump White House as chief strategist.",
      "His influence was discernible in key decisions such as the mid-2017 US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.",

    "story": [
      "The US justice department has told federal prosecutors to drop their corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "The order came from the acting deputy attorney general, appointed by President Donald Trump, who said the indictment had \"restricted\" the mayor's ability to address \"illegal immigration and violent crime\" in the city.",
      "Adams, a Democrat, has recently built a closer relationship with Trump, a Republican, and has told law enforcement to co-operate with the president's immigration raids. But he denies speaking to Trump about his case.",
      "The mayor is accused of accepting illegal campaign funds and gifts in exchange for his influence as mayor. He has pleaded not guilty to five charges.",
      "Prosecutors have not yet commented to indicate whether they intend to drop the case as requested. Any decision to do so will need to be formally submitted to the court and approved by a judge.",
      "\"You are directed, as authorised by the attorney general, to dismiss the pending charges,\" read the memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove.",
      "The memo adds that the case may be reviewed again after the November 2025 mayoral election, but it says no further \"investigate steps\" should be taken until then.",
      "It also tells prosecutors to \"take all steps within your power to cause Mayor Adams' security clearance to be restored\".",
      "Bove, who worked as Trump's defence lawyer during his criminal trial last year, wrote that the justice department \"reached this conclusion without assessing the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based\".",

      "In recent weeks, the 64-year-old mayor has directed city law enforcement to co-operate with federal immigration authorities on fresh New York City raids. Critics say this undermines local sanctuary city laws, which direct city leaders to not co-operate with authorities unless they are aiming to arrest dangerous criminals.",
      "Before the election, Trump said he and Adams had been \"persecuted\" for speaking against the immigration policies of Trump's presidential predecessor, Joe Biden.",
      "The justice department memo says \"it cannot be ignored that Mayor Adams criticized the prior administration's immigration policies before the charges were filed\".",
      "According to the 57-page indictment brought against the mayor in September, Adams is alleged to have accepted illegal gifts worth over $100,000 (\u00a375,000) from Turkish citizens and at least one government official.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:35:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Eden Knight had wanted a new life in the US but was persuaded home, according to her final X post.",
    "story": [
      "When a prominent Saudi trans woman posted her suicide note on X, her friends and followers were devastated. The note, viewed by millions, said a lawyer in the US - where she had been trying to claim asylum - had persuaded her into returning home to a family and country that would not accept her identity.",
      "The BBC World Service has identified this man as Bader Alomair, who has worked at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington DC, evidence suggests. He is linked to controversial returns from the United States of several other Saudi students - including two later accused of committing murder during their time at university.",
      "Mr Alomair has not responded to the allegations raised in our investigation.",
      "Eden Knight was from one of the Middle Eastern kingdom's most respected families. After moving to Virginia in 2019 on a Saudi government scholarship to study at George Mason University, Eden made the decision in early 2022 to transition from presenting as a man to presenting as a woman, by wearing feminine clothes and taking female sex hormones.",
      "Eden found a community on X and Discord where she felt accepted and started to grow a following online. In one post, she shared a picture of her Saudi ID photo next to her new feminine look and the post went viral.",
      "Being transgender in Saudi Arabia is not tolerated by society or government - we have spoken to several transgender Saudis, now living outside the kingdom, who told us about the harassment, and in some cases violence, they had experienced.",
      "Returning to Saudi Arabia could therefore have been difficult for Eden. We understand her student visa expired at around the time of her viral tweet so she decided to seek asylum in the US to stay there permanently.",
      "Eden said she was messaged by an old friend who put her in contact with an American private investigator, Michael Pocalyko. He offered to help with her asylum claim, and mend the relationship with her family - according to another friend, Hayden, who Eden was living with in Georgia at the time.",
      "Other friends have shared messages with us from Eden, which say Mr Pocalyko told her she needed to move from Georgia to Washington DC to lodge her claim.",
      "According to the final message she posted on X, in late October 2022, the private investigator met Eden off the train in the US capital. He was accompanied by a Saudi lawyer named Bader, she wrote.",
      "\"I genuinely was optimistic and believed this could work,\" Eden said in her final post. She said Bader put her up in a nice apartment near Washington DC and took her sightseeing.",
      "But over time it seems she began to question his motives. Eden wrote to friends, in messages shared with the BBC, that Bader was \"detransitioning\" her. She told them that Bader tried to throw out all of her feminine clothing and told her to stop hormone therapy.",
      "Eden also told friends that Bader advised her she could not apply for asylum in the US and that she must return to Saudi Arabia to do this. A US immigration expert said such advice would be incorrect.",
      "In December 2022, Eden messaged friends to say: \"I am going [back to Saudi] with a lawyer and wishing for the best.\" Her suicide note on X makes clear that the lawyer in question was someone called \"Bader\".",
      "It was not long before Eden was telling friends that returning was a mistake.",
      "She messaged them to say her parents had taken her passport and the government had instructed her to close her X account. Eden told friends she had evidence her parents had hired people to get her back to Saudi Arabia, though she never shared that evidence.",
      "\"The lawyer that was helping me with asylum was working with my parents behind my back,\" she told one of them.",
      "Over the next few months, Eden's friends say, she lost any hope of escaping Saudi Arabia.",
      "She worked in a junior position at a tech company and in public assumed her original male identity. Eden messaged a friend to say she was trying to continue taking female hormones, but that her parents repeatedly confiscated them. Eden told friends that she suffered constant verbal abuse, and sent them a video - which we have seen - that she secretly recorded of a family member shouting that she had been brainwashed by Western ideas.",
      "Eden took her own life on 12 March 2023.",
      "We wanted to find \"Bader\" - the lawyer who Eden accused of detransitioning her and persuading her home, to ask him more about the events running up to her death.",
      "We searched for lawyers of that name in the DC area, and one came up: Bader Alomair. There was limited information about him online, but an outdated directory for professionals working in Riyadh gave his full name in Arabic - which in turn led us to an inactive Facebook account showing a photo of him at Harvard Law School.",
      "In texts Eden sent to friends, she mentioned her lawyer had been Harvard-educated.",
      "Then, a source shared a crucial photo - taken by Eden from the apartment Mr Alomair had installed her in. We were able to geolocate it to a residential block on the outskirts of Washington DC.",
      "One person there told us he had known Eden and had seen her with Mr Alomair.",
      "He said Eden owned feminine clothing, jewellery and make-up, but would have to hide it when Mr Alomair came over. He made her cut her hair and told her not to shave, the witness said.",
      "We repeatedly tried to contact Mr Alomair, but he did not respond. When we visited the address listed on his DC Bar registration, we saw a man matching photos of him get into an SUV and drive away.",
      "We followed, noting the car's unusual number plate - its code indicated the car was issued by the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington DC, and that the vehicle's owner was embassy staff.",
      "Mr Alomair's role in the embassy was to support Saudi students in the US - a lawyer who previously worked with him told us.",
      "We discovered news articles highlighting instances of Mr Alomair helping those left homeless by a hurricane in Florida, for example. But we also discovered his assistance had extended to more controversial situations.",
      "On 13 October 2018, two Saudi students were questioned by US police over the death of an aspiring rapper in North Carolina - stabbed, reportedly after an altercation with the pair.",
      "Some two months later, Abdullah Hariri and Sultan Alsuhaymi were charged with murder, but by then had left the US.",
      "Just four days after the stabbing, Mr Hariri was on a flight back to Saudi Arabia, an email shared with us suggests. It includes details of the flights home which our source told us Mr Alomair organised for both Mr Hariri and Mr Alsuhaymi.",
      "Neither student has ever commented publicly on the case.",
      "Mr Alomair was sent an invoice for the flights a month later, another email shows, which our source says he would have needed to get reimbursement from the Saudi embassy.",
      "Another source says he has worked with him to represent dozens of other Saudi students in the US against charges ranging from speeding to drink-driving.",
      "\"Bader would come to the meetings with an Arabic form headed by the Saudi embassy for students to sign [which] promised to pay back legal fees to the Saudi government once they returned home.\"",
      "The source told us the students would appear at their first hearing but vanish before any subsequent hearings, though we do not know if Mr Alomair had any role in this.",
      "In 2019, the FBI warned that Saudi officials likely facilitated the escape of Saudi citizens from US legal proceedings.",
      "\"The FBI assesses that Kingdom of Saudi Arabia officials almost certainly assist US-based Saudi citizens to avoid legal issues, undermining the US judicial process. This assessment is made with high confidence.\"",
      "People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube",
      "Sources have told us Mr Alomair continues to live and work in the US. He owns multiple commercial properties around Washington DC and in August 2024 appears to have set up a new law firm in Virginia, where he is a named partner.",
      "Michael Pocalyko, Bader Alomair and the Saudi embassy in Washington DC did not respond to our questions.",
      "We contacted Eden's family to ask if they wanted to take part in this story but they did not respond.",

Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the WV factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, WV's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre for gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

    "title": "Legal showdown looms as Trump tests limits of presidential power",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 01:31:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump's latest moves could be part of a strategy to expand his presidential powers even further.",
    "story": [
      "In the first weeks of his second term, President Donald Trump has wasted no time in flexing his political muscle. That much is clear.",
      "Since taking office in January, he has ordered the suspension of all new asylum claims, cancelled refugee resettlement, frozen government hiring and spending, gutted agencies established by Congress, banned gender transition care for teenagers and offered a buyout deal for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.",
      "The whirlwind of unilateral action on his campaign promises has pushed the limits of presidential power \u2013 and prompted legal challenges from Democrats, unions and legal groups. So far the federal courts have been the only substantive roadblocks to Trump's agenda, as judges have temporarily suspended some of the most contentious proposals, including an end to automatic citizenship for anyone born on US soil.",
      "But Trump is pressing on - and seems headed for a showdown with the judiciary that could eventually end in the highest court in the land. This week, a Rhode Island judge said the Trump administration was clearly and openly defying his court order to unfreeze billions in federal funds. The White House responded by saying that \"every action\" the president took was \"completely lawful\".",
      "Vance questions authority of US judges to challenge Trump",
      "Judge blocks Trump plan to put thousands of USAID staff on leave",
      "Judge blocks Trump's bid to restrict birthright citizenship",
      "If Trump's orders do reach the US Supreme Court, six of the nine justices there - including three appointed by Trump in his first term - are conservative. Just last term, the court issued a decision holding Trump, and all future presidents, largely immune from prosecution for official actions while in office.",
      "At the time, it was a landmark expansion of presidential authority. But some observers have suggested that Trump's latest moves could be part of a strategy to expand his powers even further. If the high courts agree to uphold some of his executive orders, it could strengthen his ability to enact policy changes without the help of Congress.",
      "And even if the courts rule against the president, says Ilya Shapiro, a constitutional expert at the Manhattan Institute, those legal defeats might be politically advantageous.",
      "\"There could be political benefits to being challenged in court and then even losing in court because then you can run against judges and make political hay of it.\"",
      "There is another scenario, however. Trump could simply refuse to comply with any court that tries to stop his exercise of unfettered presidential power.",
      "In Oval Office comments on Tuesday, the president hinted that this might be an option, in his typically oblique way.",
      "\"We want to weed out the corruption,\" Trump said. \"And it seems hard to believe that a judge could say we don't want you to do that.\"",
      "\"Maybe we have to look at the judges,\" he continued. \"I think it's a very serious violation.\"",
      "On Sunday, Trump's vice-president, JD Vance, was even more blunt.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he posted on the social media site X. That view was similar to one Vance expressed in a 2021 podcast, when he said that if Trump returned to power he should refuse to comply with any court order that prevented him from firing federal workers.",
      "Directly defying a court ruling, however, would cut against centuries of US history and amount to the opening skirmishes in a constitutional crisis that pits the president against the branch of government designed to establish and interpret the law of the land.",
      "\"My read is that President Trump is testing the outer boundaries of what he might be able to get away with, doing a lot of things that are blatantly against the law and maybe some things that are closer to the line,\" said Fred Smith, a professor at the Emory School of Law.",
      "\"They are breaking a lot of norms,\" Smith added of the nascent Trump administration. \"Why he is doing that, only he knows fully. But he is doing it.\"",
      "So far, Trump and his allies have made aggressive comments about unfavourable court decisions in the public and in legal filings, but have yet to be sanctioned for disobeying a court. When Trump was the target of multiple prosecutions over the past four years, he frequently questioned the legitimacy of the presiding judges, but his courtroom lawyers adhered to the law and legal procedures.",
      "The federal judge in Rhode Island, who had placed a temporary hold on another Trump order to freeze some federal spending, did warn in court filings Monday that the administration was violating his temporary restraining order but stopped short of finding them in contempt.",
      "Conservative legal scholar Ed Whelan wrote on X that it would be \"extremely grave\" for the Trump administration to defy a federal court order.",
      "\"I'm open to the argument that truly extraordinary circumstances (the makings of a wild hypothetical) might justify defiance,\" Mr Whelan wrote. \"But in our constitutional system there should be an overwhelming presumption in favour of executive-branch compliance with federal court orders.\"",
      "Should Trump disobey, and therefore delegitimize, the courts, the decision could come back to bite him when the time comes for the president to see his own lawful agenda enforced, some legal experts say. Democratic states like California, for instance, might be inclined to ignore White House directives and federal laws they don't like - and Trump would be hard pressed to use the courts to bring them to heel.",
      "\"If the executive decides it will obey some court orders but not others, it will find it won't get any court orders that it wishes to obey,\" said Philip Bobbitt, a constitutional scholar at Columbia University Law School. \"I just don't think they thought that through.\"",
      "When Donald Trump redecorated the Oval Office to his liking in January, he reinstalled a portrait of President Andrew Jackson that had hung on the wall across from the Resolute Desk in his first term.",
      "The seventh US president is remembered for a critical moment of defiance against the United States Supreme Court. When the justices decided a dispute between the state of Georgia and Cherokee Indian governments in 1832, Jackson did not seem interested in following its direction.",
      "Jackson allegedly said of the Chief Justice's ruling, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\"",
      "Nearly 200 years later, Trump himself has found himself on his own collision course with America's judiciary."

    "story": [
      "A 25% tax is set to be imposed on all imports of steel and aluminium into the US , ending exemptions from the rules for goods from major trade partners including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, as well as the European Union.",

      "But there is a risk that the companies will pass on the added costs, or some portion of it, to consumers.",
      "Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?",
      "Canned food, beer and fizzy drinks",
      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",
      "After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won \"exclusions\" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.",
      "Since then, steel manufacturers have cut production further, pushing up prices, warned the CMI, which sent a letter to the Trump administration earlier this month signed by big food companies including General Mills, Del Monte and Goya.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the CMI, said without exemptions for can manufacturers to import steel tariff free, grocery prices for canned foods made in the US are likely to rise.",
      "\"While the president may believe that these tariffs are protecting the steel industry, they certainly are undermining our food security and our supply resiliency for American canned food, which Americans rely on every day,\" Mr Budway said.",
      "When it comes to aluminium, brewers and makers of fizzy drinks, such as Coca-Cola, have also warned the move will add costs and could lead to higher prices for customers.",
      "\"We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,\" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.",
      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "Cars",
      "After Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium during his first term, carmakers including Ford and General Motors warned the measures would add about $1bn to each of their costs.",
      "For customers, Morningstar estimated the tariff costs back then would result in a roughly 1%, or a $300 price rise for customers.",
      "David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, warned Ford could be facing a similar cost increase this time, but said it was unclear how consumers will be affected.",
      "Affordability pressures in a market where sales have yet to return to 2019 levels could limit how much of the costs companies choose to pass on, according to Michael Wall, an auto analyst at S&P Mobility.",
      "But he said it was still \"realistic\" to expect some of the costs from the metals tariffs to trickle down to buyers.",
      "However he noted that Trump's announcement of tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, currently on hold until March, would have a much bigger impact for buyers.",
      "At a business conference, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned Trump's recent moves were causing \"a lot of cost and a lot of chaos\" for his industry.",
      "TD Economics has estimated cars could up in price by about $3,000 if blanket tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada came into force.",
      "Construction, housing and appliances",
      "The construction industry as a sector is one of the single biggest users of steel, which developers and homebuilders need for everything from building frames to appliances.",
      "Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran \"totally counter\" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.",
      "\"Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" he warned.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",
      "After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.",
      "Companies unable to absorb such costs would likely pass them on through higher prices in the shops."

    "title": "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Who may turn out to be the biggest winners or losers from the new US president's trade policy.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.",
      "The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",
      "The tariff wars have begun - buckle up",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",
      "Equality",
      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",
      "The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",
      "So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.",

      "Neha Satpute and Akshay Pise felt ready to welcome their first child.",
      "Having worked in the US for more than a decade, the Indian couple who are engineers on H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, expected their son - due on 26 February - to be born an American citizen.",
      "Employed at a large tech firm with a supportive parental leave policy, they had carefully built their life in San Jose, California.",
      "But President Donald Trump recently threw a wrench in their American dream by announcing a rule that would deny automatic US citizenship to children born to temporary foreign workers. Until now, birthright citizenship had been a given regardless of parents' immigration status.",
      "Two federal judges have blocked the order, which means the ruling cannot take effect until the cases are resolved in court, although there remains a possibility of a higher court overturning any decision.",
      "The looming uncertainty, along with the multiple lawsuits and legal challenges, have left Akshay, Neha and thousands of others in limbo.",
      "\"This impacts us directly,\" says Akshay. \"If the order takes effect, we don't know what comes next - it's uncharted territory.\" Their biggest question: What nationality will their child have?",
      "Their concern is valid, says New York-based immigration attorney Cyrus Mehta: \"US law has no provision for granting non-immigrant status to a person born here.\"",
      "With their baby's due date fast approaching, they consulted their doctor about an early delivery. The advice? If all goes well, they could induce labour in the 40th week, but they've chosen to wait.",
      "\"I want the natural process to take its course,\" says Neha. Akshay adds: \"My priority is a safe delivery and my wife's health. Citizenship comes second.\"",
      "Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship. Can he do it?",
      "Dr Satheesh Kathula, president of the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI), reached out to obstetricians of Indian origin in the US after media reports of families seeking early C-sections. Except for \"a few instances in New Jersey\", most doctors reported no such inquiries.",
      "\"In a country with strict medical laws, I strongly advise against preterm C-sections just for citizenship,\" said the Ohio-based doctor. \"Our physicians are ethical and won't perform them unless medically necessary.\"",
      "US citizenship is highly coveted, especially by skilled H-1B visa holders. Indians are the second-largest immigrant group in the US.",
      "A birthright citizenship order would hit Indians hard - more than five million Indians in the US hold non-immigrant visas.",
      "South Asian parents-to-be are flooding online groups with concerns about the order's impact and next steps.",
      "Trump's executive order says it does not affect the ability of the children of lawful permanent residents to obtain documentation of US citizenship.",
      "But Indians in the US face the longest wait of any foreign nationality to receive a green card conferring lawful permanent residency.",
      "Current US rules mean that the number of green cards given to people of any one country cannot exceed 7% of the total number of green cards awarded.",
      "Indians receive 72% of H-1B visas annually. According to the Cato Institute, Indians made up 62% of the employment-based backlog of people waiting for green cards - that's 1.1 million - in 2023. Indians receiving employment-based green cards today applied back in 2012.",
      "In his report, Cato's director of immigration studies David Bier warns: \"New Indian applicants face a lifetime wait, with 400,000 likely to die before getting a green card.\"",
      "In contrast, most other immigrants get permanent residency within a year, speeding their path to citizenship.",
      "If implemented, Trump's executive order would also affect undocumented migrants in the US, whose US-born children had previously automatically gained citizenship - and who could then go on to sponsor their parents to apply for a green card when they turn 21.",
      "Pew Research estimates 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US as of 2022, making them the third-largest group. In contrast, the Migration Policy Institute puts the number at 375,000, ranking India fifth. Unauthorised immigrants make up 3% of the US population and 22% of the foreign-born population.",
      "The main concern for Indians on H-1B or O visas is their children's quality of life.",
      "Such visa-holders must leave the US periodically to have their visas stamped in a US embassy abroad. Those who return to India for this purpose frequently face delays in getting an appointment for this purpose.",
      "These immigrants don't want their US-born children to endure the same bureaucratic struggles.",
      "Waiting in the green card queue for several years, Akshay is aware of the ease US citizenship brings.",
      "\"We have been here for more than 10 years. As I see my parents getting older, it's very important for me to have citizenship. Travelling becomes tricky for us with coordinating visa stamping timings, and now with my baby it might be more difficult,\" he said.",
      "Many physicians in the US oppose Trump's decree, highlighting the role foreign skilled workers play in providing vital services.",
      "Dr Kathula says Indian doctors in rural areas such as North and South Dakota are crucial. \"Without them, healthcare would collapse. Now, they're in limbo about starting families,\" he said.",
      "He is calling for the process of getting a green card to be sped up and for these workers' children to be granted birthright citizenship because of their parents' contributions to America.",
      "Trump's order has also heightened anxiety among Indians on student and work visas, already aware of their precarious legal status. The one guarantee - their US-born children's citizenship - is now in doubt.",

      "But it has not seen a major eruption in recent times, in fact not since the 1950s, so the reason for the current crisis is unclear.",
      "Experts say they're seeing many earthquakes within a relatively small area, which don't fit the pattern of a mainshock-aftershock sequence, says Dr Ganas.",
      "He said this began with the awakening of a volcano on Santorini last summer. Then in January there was a \"surge\" of seismic activity with smaller earthquakes being recorded.",

      "Dr Margarita Segou from the British Geological Survey described the quakes as happening every day \"in pulses\".",

      "How much longer will this seismic activity last?",
      "In short, it is impossible to tell. There are hopes that Wednesday's quake, which struck at night, will be the biggest one to hit the island.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:31:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The far right here and elsewhere in Europe attracts an increasing number of young people, particularly men.",
    "story": [
      "\"What my parents taught me is that they used to live in peace and calm, without having to have any fear in their own country,\" says 19-year-old Nick. \"I would like to live in a country where I don't have to be afraid.\"",
      "I meet him in a small bar on a street corner in the ex-mining town of Freiberg, Saxony \u2013 where he is playing darts.",
      "It's a cold, foggy night in February with just over two weeks to go until Germany's national election.",
      "Nick and his friend Dominic, who is 30, are backers or sympathetic to Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland - a party that has been consistently polling second in Germany for more than a year and a half, as the far right here and elsewhere in Europe attracts an increasing number of young people, particularly men, into its orbit.",
      "One particular reason why Nick \u2013 and many other young German men \u2013 say they are afraid is the number of attacks in Germany involving suspects who were asylum seekers \u2013 most recently, the fatal stabbing of a toddler and a man in a park in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg. Immigration is now Nick and Dominic's main concern, although they don't oppose it in all forms.",
      "\"The people who integrate, who learn, who study here, do their work - I have no problems with them,\" says Dominic, though he is critical of anyone he sees as taking advantage of the asylum system.",
      "\"But these days such statements are seen as hostile,\" says Dominic. \"You're called a Nazi because of Germany's past.\"",
      "The AfD  - which has long been accused of anti-migrant rhetoric - is celebrating endorsements from tech billionaire, Elon Musk, who owns the social media site X. He has hosted a live discussion with party leader Alice Weidel on the platform and dialled into a party rally.",
      "Now, as Germany waits to see just how well the far right does in the upcoming election, the question is why so many young men in particular are being drawn to the far right and what the consequences could be for a country that's deeply conscious of its Nazi past.",
      "Young men swinging to the right",
      "Pew research in 2024 found that 26% of German men had positive views of the AfD compared to 11% of women, and the share of men holding this opinion has risen 10 points since 2022.",
      "In the elections for the European Parliament in 2024, according to German exit polls the number of under 24-year-olds, both male and female, who voted for the AfD in Germany rose to 16 per cent, up by 11 points from 2019.",
      "This comes at a time of rising general anxiety among young people according to a recent study by the German Institute for Generational Research.",
      "In a sample size of 1,000 Germans aged 16 to 25, anxiety levels were the highest amongst respondents who class themselves as far-right while they were the lowest amongst people who put themselves in the middle of the political spectrum.",
      "Women were more likely to be concerned for their rights and those of minority groups while men were found to be more worried about conservative values that are less based around rights.",
      "Dr R\u00fcdiger Maas, from the German think tank the Institute for Generational Research, says parties on the left often focus on themes such as feminism, equality and women's rights.",
      "\"Overall, men don't see themselves in these themes,\" he tells us. \"That is why they have a tendency to vote further right.\"",
      "Hard, populist right parties have also done well in countries such as France, Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Italy.",
      "\"Sixty per cent of young men under 30 would consider voting for the far right in EU countries and this is much higher than the share among women,\" says Prof Abou-Chadi, in analysis drawn from a subset of the 2024 European Election Study.",
      "Message spreaders",
      "As well as gender, migration and economic issues, social media is playing a part. Platforms like TikTok allow political groups to bypass mainstream, traditional media, which the far right regard as hostile.",
      "It's clear that AfD \"dominates\" TikTok when compared to other German parties, says Mauritius Dorn from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). It has 539,000 followers on its parliamentary account, compared to 158,000 for the SPD who currently have the most seats in the German parliament.",
      "And it isn't just official accounts but a \"considerable number of unofficial fan accounts also help to disseminate the party's content\", says Mr Dorn.",
      "Through setting up 10 \"persona-based\" accounts with different user profiles, they found, \"those users who are more on the right-wing spectrum\u2026 see a lot of AfD content whereas users from the leftist spectrum see a more diverse set of political content.\"",
      "TikTok has said it doesn't \"differentiate\" between the right, left or centre of politics and works to stay at the \"forefront\" of tackling misinformation.",
      "Dorn observes that other parties recognised sites such as TikTok \"too late\", which means they're playing catch-up in establishing a strong footprint on the platform.",
      "We've met one AfD influencer, Celina Brychcy - a 25-year-old TikTokker who has more than 167,000 followers - 53% of whom are male, with 76% aged between 18 and 35.",
      "She mainly shares dance, trend and lifestyle videos, but also pro-AfD content.",
      "Ms Brychcy says she doesn't make money from promoting the AfD but does it because she believes in the cause and wants to \"get a message across\".",
      "Her political ideals include wanting the return of military service, more support for mothers who want or need to stay at home and stricter border controls.",
      "When I press her about whether her views amount to a rejection of multiculturalism she replied no, but believes people should \"integrate.\"",
      "\"There are certain people who just don't fit in with us Germans,\" she added but repeatedly insisted she is not racist and doesn't have \"anything against foreigners.\"",
      "Anti 'role reversal'",
      "Ms Brychcy is also against \"role reversal\" when it comes to the way men and women dress.",
      "A reaction against \"gender ideology\" is another issue identified by Tarik Abou-Chadi, a professor of European Politics at the University of Oxford, as feeding far-right support amongst the young - something that is echoed by the Institute for Generational Research.",
      "They asked first-time voters whether they found the LGBTQ+ trend \"\u00fcbertrieben\", which literally means \"exaggerated\" or over the top. The respondents who showed the highest level of agreement with that question were those who planned to support the AfD.",
      "When I challenge Ms Brychcy over whether that could be seen as retrograde, she replied that \"biologically speaking, we are men and women\" and thinks people should present accordingly.",
      "Ms Brychcy tells me she has lost a couple of friends because of her politics - and now mostly spends time with those of a similar outlook.",
      "She doesn't agree with those who view the AfD as a dangerous movement - rather one that would offer genuine, radical change.",
      "When I ask Ms Brychcy if she considers herself as far-right, she says that on certain issues - such as border control and crime, \"Definitely yes\".",
      "It's a striking reply, particularly as often, the label of far-right is rejected by supporters of the AfD, including by the party leader, Alice Weidel, who insists she heads a conservative, libertarian movement.",
      "With the horrors of the Nazis further and further in the past, this is a generation that's grown up with parties like the AfD - whether that's on TV talk shows or in parliament after the AfD got its first MPs in 2017.",
      "Prof Abou-Chadi believes that the far right, generally, has become more normalised to the point, \"They don't seem so extreme any more.\"",
      "That's despite party scandals such as a talisman of the AfD's hard right, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, being fined twice last year for using a Nazi slogan, though he denied doing so knowingly.",
      "The AfD, in three German states, is classified as right-wing extremist by authorities - including in Saxony, a designation the party unsuccessfully challenged in court.",
      "It's a state where the number of \"right-wing extremist individuals\" had reached a \"new high\" - according to a report released last year by Saxony's domestic intelligence service - that showed data back to 2015.",
      "Narratives questioned",
      "In a shopping mall in the city of Chemnitz in Saxony, we meet a group of young men who \u2013 while they won't go on the record \u2013 tell us they're right wing.",
      "Dressed in black, with uniformly short hair, they express beliefs that homosexuality is wrong and fear that the German \"race\" is under threat because of the growing migrant community.",
      "They question narratives about their country's past, seemingly a reference to the Nazi era.",
      "Diana Schwitalla has been teaching history and social studies for eight years. She says she has had to confront a case of Holocaust denial in the classroom and has heard other troubling remarks.",
      "\"We hear the Second World War was actually a good thing, and there was a reason people died then - and that this is good. Hitler is described as a good man,\" says Ms Schwitalla.",
      "She adds, \"Many students\u2026 very young students, {who} say it doesn't matter who I vote for, they'll do what they want 'up there' anyway. The question of who's 'up there', I don't get an answer to that.\"",
      "We met her over the course of two days - including at an adult vocational college in Freiberg that sits on the grounds of a former Nazi concentration camp. Jewish women, brought from Auschwitz, were used for slave labour here to make parts for aeroplanes.",
      "We did hear some talk of opposition to the levels of immigration into Germany plus a desire for national pride.",
      "The first day we met Ms Schwitalla, she is helping to organise a mock election for the students as a way of engaging them about democracy at another college site in the town of Fl\u00f6ha \u2013 about 15 miles away from Freiberg.",
      "We spoke to Cora, Melina and Joey, all 18.",
      "Cora says she has heard men of her age express a desire for women to be in the home harking back to a time \"when women took care of the children and when the husband comes home from work, the food is cooked\". She likens it to the so-called \"Trad Wife\" trend of adhering to traditional gender roles.",
      "Cora and Melina voice fears about a rollback of women's rights \u2013 including on abortion, even - remarkably - the right to vote. \"Luckily that's not being discussed in politics yet,\" says Melina, \"but I've heard discussions about women not being allowed to vote in elections any more.\"",
      "A small group of students line up to vote around lunchtime and we watch as the results come in with \"Die Linke\" scoring top - the left party that's relatively popular amongst the young but polling at only around five per cent nationwide.",
      "The AfD came second, reinforcing what Prof Abou-Chadi has found, that, \"younger people are much more likely to go for a further left or further right party than a centrist one\".",
      "Not a protest vote",
      "The AfD, whose signature issues include security, borders and migrant crime, are now even embracing the concept of \"remigration\" - a buzz-word in Europe's far right that's widely understood to mean mass deportations.",
      "Speaking to people in Germany, it is clear that support for the AfD can not just be read as some form of protest vote, even if there is frustration with the parties that have traditionally governed Germany. Celina, Dominic and Nick - and others we spoke to - genuinely hope and believe that the AfD could set Germany on the path of radical change.",
      "It's still the case that other parties will not go into coalition with the AfD but in January a non-binding motion was passed in the German parliament thanks to AfD votes for the first time.",
      "Prof Abou-Chadi believes in the longer term, there could be an even more seismic change.",
      "\"And as soon as the more mainstream parties start giving up the 'firewall' or cordon sanitaire the far right will start cannibalising the right.",
      "\"It's very likely that, in many or most European countries, the far-right parties will be the main party on the right \u2013 or already are,\" he says.",
      "Parties like the AfD have worked hard to try and normalise themselves in the eyes of the public.",

      "\"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue,\" said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Everyone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "But there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\".",
      "But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.",
      "Drake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.",
      "Sunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.",
      "But the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight.",
      "He performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).",
      "Actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.",
      "\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie.",

      "The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.",
      "Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.",
      "SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.",
      "Not Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\".",
      "He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".",
      "For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.",
      "Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.",
      "And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.",
      "The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.",

      "On-stage protest",

    "title": "How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:43:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The growth is led by a tourism boom, with Spain nearing France as the world's most visited country.",
    "story": [
      "It's a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city's Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies.",
      "Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.",
      "\"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.",
      "\"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\"",
      "Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub.",
      "And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.",
      "By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.",
      "This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy.",
      "\"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.",
      "Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.",
      "\"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds.",
      "That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.",
      "Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.",
      "\"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School.",
      "Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\".",
      "Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.",
      "Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.",
      "At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills.",
      "Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.",
      "\"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\"",
      "The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.",
      "The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.",
      "\"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\"",
      "Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.",
      "Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.",
      "This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.",
      "Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as \"fundamental\".",
      "The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon.",
      "The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern.",
      "Another is Spain's vast public debt, which is higher than the country's annual economic output.",
      "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros warns that this is \"an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU's new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability\".",
      "In addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation.",
      "With an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for S\u00e1nchez's minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth.",

    "summary": "Brands paid millions to air their commercials during Super Bowl 2025. Here's what's behind the cost, and why advertisers say it's worth it.",
    "story": [
      "On the eve of Super Bowl 59, the\u00a0Philadelphia Eagles\u00a0and\u00a0Kansas City Chiefs\u00a0aren't the only ones dreaming of touchdowns. Brands and advertisers with millions riding on the success of commercials to be aired during the 2025 Super Bowl broadcast are also hoping to score. Here's a look at how much money goes into Super Bowl ads, and why advertisers say the high-cost commercials are worth it.",
      "How much do Super Bowl commercials cost on average for 2025?",
      "Advertisers are shelling out close to $8 million on average for a 30-second spot during Super Bowl LIX, Peter Bray, founder and executive creative director at ad agency Bray & Co., told CBS MoneyWatch. He estimates that around 51 minutes of advertising has been sold for the approximately three to four hour broadcast this year, making the total amount of ad sales somewhere in the hundreds of millions.",
      "Want to watch Super Bowl 2025 commercials early? These ads are already live.",
      "Want to watch Super Bowl 2025 commercials early? These ads are already live.",
      "The close to $8 million price tag is almost a million dollars more than the $7 million it cost for a 30-second spot in Super Bowl 2024. Commercial air time during the NFL Championship in 2023 was also about $7 million for 30 seconds, a 55% jump from 2019. Super Bowl advertising costs are \"creeping up,\" said Bray, who believes ad sales for the broadcast will soon reach $1 billion.",
      "\"I think in three years it's going to hit a billion dollars in ad sales. And that has never before happened on the planet. That is the immensity of this event,\" he said.",
      "Why are Super Bowl ads so expensive?",
      "\"It's the advertising industry's Super Bowl as well,\" Bray said. \"It's the one time of year where the general public actually cares about advertising so it's an exciting time.\"",
      "And social media, he says, has only made the broadcast more important.",
      "\"It's actually made advertising in the Super Bowl more relevant than ever because what's happened is with all these different platforms, it's very difficult to find a large audience at once,\" Bray said. \"Someone might advertise as an advertiser on TikTok, or on Instagram ... all of these different advertising opportunities. But you might be duplicating because the audience on TikTok, maybe 90% are the same audience on Instagram, so there's a lot of duplication.\"",
      "More than 120 million people are expected to watch Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, which will be broadcast on Fox and\u00a0livestreamed for free\u00a0on Tubi. To keep those viewers transfixed, brands will try to use humor, emotion or a famous actor to create a cultural moment that a mass audience can engage with collectively.",
      "\"Comedy can be a safe route for brands, and you don't want to divide your audience at all, so comedy makes sense. There's more celebrities being used than ever,\" Bray said.",
      "Depending on a celebrity's level of fame, they can add anywhere from less than $50,000 for a brief cameo to millions of dollars. Bray said he estimates the tab for most stars that appear in a Super Bowl spot to be in the $2 million range.",
      "Dunkin' spends big \u2014 and wins",
      "For his role in a Dunkin' ad last year, meanwhile, Ben Affleck was paid nearly $10 million, CNN reported; it was his second appearance in a Super Bowl commercial for the global donut and coffee giant.",
      "Dunkin' first featured Affleck \u2014 a Boston native and actual Dunkin' donuts fan \u2014 in its inaugural Super Bowl ad in 2023. The 30-second spot, which included a cameo of his then wife, Jennifer Lopez, garnered 7 billion impressions for the company after its first airing, according to Dunkin' President Scott Murphy in a 2024 interview with Entreprenuer magazine. The ad was produced by\u00a0 Artists Equity, a company founded by Affleck and Matt Damon in 2022.",
      "A multipart campaign followed,\u00a0including\u00a0a promotion featuring Gen Z rapper Ice Spice. The storyline culminated with Dunkin's 2024 Super Bowl ad, a comedic 60-second spot that introduces the characters The DunKings, an aspirational rap group Affleck forms with Matt Damon and Tom Brady, dressed in bright orange and pink track suits.",
      "One year and many\u00a0sold-out track suits later, Dunkin' and Affleck return for their third Super Bowl ad collaboration, which\u00a0features\u00a0Casey Affleck and \"Succession\" star Jeremy Strong.",
      "\"Ben Affleck is a great combination with Dunkin',\" said Bray, \"Not because of him as an actor or director, but how he's perceived in popular culture. \"Jeremy Strong from 'Succession,' he's a kooky guy, but he's known as a method actor. Dunkin' know this ... they're connecting who these celebrities are as people rather than actors to the brands. And that makes for a really powerful ad.\"",
      "How much did Super Bowl commercials cost in past years?",

      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",
      "As for Stephanie Courtney, she's given up her youthful dreams of appearing on Broadway or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she still performs every week with The Groundlings improv group.",
      "And she still loves being Flo. \"I will tell you, the thing that made my heart grow three sizes that day was the Halloween costumes, seeing, especially like little kids, I love it so much,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm like, 'Just keep reapplying powder, reapply your lipstick. Go forth, be free, go spread the word!'\" Courtney laughed.",

    "title": "The New Yorker magazine's first hundred years",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2025 09:48:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The beloved weekly magazine encompassing journalism, fiction, poetry and cartoons, is celebrating its centenary. New Yorker writer Kelefa Sanneh goes inside the magazine's history to explore its longevity, national reach, and idiosyncratic appeal.",
    "story": [
      "The New Yorker, the beloved weekly magazine, is celebrating its one-hundredth birthday. I have been a staff writer at the magazine since 2008, and Bruce Diones has been at The New Yorker since, well, not quite since the beginning. \"1978,\" he said. \"I was in the cradle. They left me on the doorstep and I came.\"",
      "Asked his title, Diones replied , \"I don't really have one. I aid and abet all the crimes that happen here. I'm that guy that's always around.\"",
      "\"An expert on both the people and the magazine?\"",
      "\"That's right.\"",
      "\"You can tell me what we published in 1979, but you can also tell me who's mad at whom?\"",
      "\"Yeah, and I can tell you why they're mad at them and why that thing in '79 didn't work out!\" he laughed.",
      "The New Yorker is known for its reporting, and for its idiosyncrasies. Each issue also includes cartoons, a short story, and a few poems. The front cover features not a photograph, but a painting.",
      "One of Diones' many responsibilities is to organize the magazine's archive. \"We have every magazine, every issue since the first one. We have scrapbooks, papers and all sorts of weird little ephemera from the people's offices. It's kind of fun, interesting stuff.\"",
      "The New Yorker may be America's leading literary magazine, but its story starts with an artist: Rea Irvin. \"All the artwork in The New Yorker is based on his work,\" Diones said.",
      "Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse.",
      "\"At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley,\" said editor David Remnick. \"Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery.\"",
      "Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society.",
      "In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, \"It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.\"",
      "I asked, \"What did he have against Iowa?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Remnick laughed. \"To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles \u2026\"",
      "The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. \"We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque,\" Remnick said. \"It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking.\"",
      "Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers \u2013 more than two dozen.",
      "So, what is a fact-checker? \"Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be,\" McIntosh said.",
      "\"Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out,\" I said.",
      "\"I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us,\" McIntosh laughed.",
      "And everything gets checked \u2013 not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Matthews, the department's associate director, once had to fact-check a cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. \"He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'\" she recalled. \"And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic.\"",
      "\"But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny,\" I said.",
      "\"Not pithy enough, no,\" said Matthews. \"All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'\"",
      "Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.",
      "The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month.",
      "So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, \"It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in.\"",
      "\"Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?\"",
      "\"I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure,\" said Remnick.",
      "\"Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging.\"",
      "These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, \"How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation \u2013 four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine.\"",
      "For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: \"He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers.\"",
      "One letter was a request to visit the magazine's offices. Keefe responded: \"Thank you for your letter. We're afraid there isn't much to see in our offices. The editors and writers are all shut away in little cubicles and are very upset if people pop in on them.\"",
      "In fact, those old editors and writers and artists and cartoonists are still here, in spirit, and also in these boxes. The party's been going for a hundred years, and new people are still being invited to join in.",
      "I said, \"maybe in another 100 years, someone will come and flip through whatever the newest version of that archives is?\"",
      "\"That's right, and I'm in it now,\" laughed Diones. \"And you're in it, too. That's kind of the thrill of it. You realize that, well, oh, this has always been going on, and we're all a part of it.\"",

    "summary": "Pugilism has been a favored subject of artists and photographers since boxers first stepped into the ring. \"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\" an exhibit in West Palm Beach, Fla., captures this most combative of sports.",
    "story": [
      "Muhammed Ali is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time. But he also packed a punch with art works, like this 1967 drawing called \"The Crowd,\" seen from his perspective looking out from the ring, with some in the audience smiling, some frowning. \"I love that part where he is acknowledging that not only did he have fans, but he might have had some haters as well,\" said curator Arden Sherman.",
      "Four of Ali's works are prominently featured in \u00a0\"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\"\u00a0at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida. It's an exhibition devoted to boxing \u2013 winners, losers, and everything in-between.",
      "Sherman says the show explores a host of different aspects about this most accessible of sports: \"It's rare to encounter a human of a certain age on this planet that doesn't have an understanding of the sport of boxing,\" she said.",
      "Artists do seem to gravitate toward boxing. There are more than 100 works on display here \u2013 paintings, photographs and sculptures \u2013 including many by and about women. One work by Zoe Buchman features frilly fabrics on boxing gloves. Sherman said. \"She's someone who is consistently standing up for female rights and female empowerment.\"",
      "Sherman says the exhibit comes at a very auspicious time: \"I believe, as humans, we find ourselves fighting for something or defending another thing. It is a contentious moment we live in, and what better way to express that but through the symbolism granted to us through the sport of boxing.\"",
      "So, the give-and-take in works like this, by George Bellows, perhaps America's best-known painter of boxing, seems to take on new meaning.",
      "This 1923 work, called \"Introducing John L. Sullivan,\" depicts not just a famous boxer and the announcer, but also the promoters, money makers, and wheeler-dealers behind all of it.",
      "The exhibit features some heavyweight artists: There's Roy Lichtenstein's \"Sweet Dreams Baby!\" from 1965, and Keith Haring's late 1980s painted steel sculpture.",
      "Sherman says the artists are \"thinking about love, violence, fantasy, death. \u2026 I think the artists are thinking about being alive. I think they are thinking about their own identity, and how they navigate that in this world.\"",
      "Among the most recent works is a pair of paintings from 2023 by Jared McGriff. \"One of the things about boxing and this act of being in a battle is that it can be disorienting,\" he said. \"The thing that I think about with these two works is this idea of internal struggle and the idea of what it takes from an internal determination and focus standpoint to reach this level of athleticism.\"",
      "There are also flashes of humor, such as Michael Halsband's 1985 photo of artists Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat in boxing gear:",
      "... or Harry Benson's famous shot of a very young Muhammad Ali meeting the very young Beatles in a Miami gym on their first trip to the U.S., in 1964:",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:14:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Pertussis cases are on the rise again, after a dip following the winter holidays.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. confirmed at least a dozen deaths from whooping cough last year, according to preliminary figures released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That marks the most fatalities from the bacterial infection since a 2017 surge of the illness, which is also known as pertussis.",
      "Over the last month, pertussis infections have been rising again. While cases reported to the CDC by health departments dipped over the winter holidays, weekly infections have accelerated for a month straight since then.",
      "At least 360 pertussis cases were reported nationwide in last week's update to the CDC's tally of infections. Cases are up 27% from the week before.",
      "Weekly cases peaked at 577 late last year, before plummeting to less than 200 over the New Year's holiday.",
      "Florida reported 44 cases last week, the most of any state. That displaces Ohio, which had been the state with the most pertussis infections for many recent weeks.",
      "Cases have been reported in counties throughout Florida, according to data from the state's health department, with the largest tallies around Miami and Tampa.",
      "Similar to other states, most cases reported in Florida have been in children under 5 years old. More than a third of whooping cough cases have been in older kids.",
      "\"People of all ages are at risk for getting pertussis (whooping cough). Everyone who is not up to date with whooping cough vaccination should get vaccinated,\" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a statement.",
      "Whooping cough can initially be difficult to separate from other cold-causing germs that surge over the colder months. Pertussis infections are called whooping cough because of the sound of severe coughing attacks, which can linger for weeks.",
      "Some people are at higher risk of life-threatening complications from whooping cough infections, including babies and people who are not up to date on their vaccines.",
      "Prince, the CDC spokesperson, said data on pertussis deaths for January 2025 was not available. Whooping cough deaths can take several weeks to be confirmed.",
      "A local health department earlier this month in Washington announced the first whooping cough death in the state since 2011. A 5-year-old had died in November 2024, but was only confirmed as a pertussis death by the CDC in recent weeks.",
      "The child had not completed the pertussis vaccine series, the Spokane Regional Health District said in a release, and also had \"other health factors that contributed\" to their death.",
      "\"This death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination, especially for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and young children,\" Dr. Francisco Velazquez, the county's health officer, said in a statement.",
      "Officials have warned for months that the U.S. was likely on track to see a major wave in whooping cough cases. While infections usually climb every three to five years, pertussis was among many germs that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Other changes have also driven up pertussis cases in recent years, including a change in 2020 intended to cut down on missed cases by epidemiologists and waning immunity from pertussis vaccines.",
      "\"We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment,\" said Dr. Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami.",
      "He said it had been many years since they had seen a major outbreak of pertussis infections, as opposed to \"little pockets of increases\" around their system.",
      "Mestre said older pertussis patients often come into the emergency room after facing a persistent cough that does not go away after a week or so. Younger babies come in to get evaluated sooner and are at higher risk.",
      "\"They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness,\" said Mestre.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 13:18:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The NGO Doctors for America argued that HHS, CDC and FDA violated federal law in removing medical information from public-facing websites.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration to restore webpages and data that had been scrubbed in compliance with President Trump's executive order on gender ideology\u00a0while litigation moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates agreed to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the group Doctors for America, which argued that its members used the websites when treating patients and conducting research. The nonprofit organization said that the removal of the webpages by the Department of Health and Human Services and its components violated federal law.",
      "Bates found that the challengers were likely to succeed in their claims that the Department Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA acted unlawfully when they stripped medical information from public-facing websites.",
      "\"It bears emphasizing who ultimately bears the harm of defendants' actions: everyday Americans, and most acutely, underprivileged Americans, seeking healthcare,\" he wrote. Citing declarations from two doctors filed in the case, Bates said if they \"cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health.\"",
      "His order directs the agencies to restore earlier versions of their websites by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. It comes after Bates held a hearing on the matter Monday.",
      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's pick to head the department that oversees the NIH, may undo the cuts, according to Sen. Susan Collins.

      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down\"",

      "That strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus, called D1.1 by scientists, is different from a previous variant called B3.13 which had infected at least 40 dairy workers in the U.S. to date.",
      "D1.1 was also behind a\u00a0fatal case in Louisiana in a person who was hospitalized last year, raising concerns that the strain might lead to more severe disease in humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 14 other cases last year have also been linked to D1.1 from birds, which did not result in hospitalization.",
      "B3.13 has led to only symptoms of conjunctivitis \u2014 or pink eye \u2014 in many cases and research suggests it is less severe for humans than other bird flu strains.",
      "So far, health authorities in Nevada say the dairy worker, who tested positive after working with sick cows in the state's Churchill County, had only pink eye as their symptom and is now recovering.",
      "\"There is currently no evidence of person to person spread of this virus. Close contacts of the infected person and other workers exposed at the farm are being contacted and monitored for symptoms and are being offered personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and antiviral medication,\" the Central Nevada Health District said in a statement.",

      "While the seasonal flu vaccine is not designed to boost protection against H5N1, there are different kinds of vaccines that health authorities have prepared for a potential bird flu pandemic.",
      "Health authorities routinely test those pandemic vaccines against the bird flu virus to see if new strains have evolved to escape the protection from those shots.",
      "Previous testing by the CDC with D1.1 strains spreading in wild birds have found that the pandemic vaccines stockpiled by the U.S. government should still offer protection, two health officials told CBS News.",

      "Officials said at the time that there was not yet a need to roll out the immunizations, citing the largely mild symptoms in infected workers and lack of human-to-human spread.",
      "Virtually all U.S. human cases of bird flu have been linked to direct contact with sick animals, often during intensive exposures like caring directly for sick animals or culling large flocks of infected birds. That includes the person who died in the Louisiana case, who had direct contact with sick birds.",

    "summary": "A program begun in Zimbabwe in which grandmothers and older listeners serve as \"first responders\" for those seeking mental health assistance in underserved communities has now expanded to nine countries, including the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Dixon Chibanda remembers like yesterday the moment in 2005 that changed his life. \"During my formative years working as a psychiatrist, I lost a patient of mine to suicide. Erica was her name. She had hanged herself from a mango tree in the family garden.\"",
      "Erica was just 25 years old.",
      "Chibanda, a psychiatrist based in Harare, Zimbabwe, says her family knew she needed help. \"They lived some 200 miles away from where I worked,\" he said. \"And they just didn't have the equivalent of US$15 to get onto a bus to come to the hospital.\"",
      "At the time, there were only 10 psychiatrists serving 13 million people in Zimbabwe. So, Chibanda came up with an idea involving grandmothers: \"These grandmas were actually, you know, the custodians of the local culture and the wisdom, and they were rooted in their communities. And I was like, what if we could train them to be the first port of call for anyone needing to talk in a community?\"",
      "So, in 2006, Chibanda introduced the \"Friendship Bench,\" a talk therapy program that brings mental healthcare directly into underserved communities. The program is free, and the grandmothers were happy to donate their time.",
      "He chronicled this journey in a new book: \"The Friendship Bench: How Fourteen Grandmothers Inspired a Mental Health Revolution\" (New World Library).",
      "\"When I first started this, in fact we called it the Mental Health Bench,\" he said. \"Interestingly, nobody came to the Mental Health Bench, because of the stigma, until the grandmas said, 'You know, why don't you turn it into a Friendship Bench?'\"",
      "During that first year, 14 volunteer grandmothers shared a Friendship Bench with several hundred visitors in that one suburb. Chibanda says the program has since expanded beyond grandmothers to include over 3,000 older listeners who last year saw more than 300,000 people all over Zimbabwe.",
      "He said, \"There are a lot of people out there who are struggling to just connect with another human being. And this gives them that opportunity, to be able to sit down with someone who is empathic.\"",
      "Globally, just under 300 million people are struggling with depression, according to the World Health Organization. Only about one-third of them receive any treatment. And at a time when we're facing an epidemic of loneliness and isolation affecting 1 in 5 American adults (according to a 2024 Gallup poll), the Friendship Bench is hitting the road, expanding to vulnerable communities in 9 countries and counting, including the United States.",
      "At the Washington Seniors Wellness Center, in our nation's capital, the program is being piloted by the nonprofit organization HelpAge USA, which focuses on the inclusion of older people.",
      "Seventy-four-year-old Arnette Ibitayo says she was struggling with the deaths of her son and brother. \"My son's was sudden; he had a heart attack at 44,\" she said. \"And then my brother had COVID.\"",
      "She turned to the Friendship Bench. \"So I'm, you know, feeling down, depressed,\" she said. \"I think I need to talk to somebody, because I felt like isolating and staying home. And it was very comforting to get it out. And I wasn't judged, and I was able to speak freely, and the person gave me some helpful advice.\"",
      "That person was Theresa Kelly, a retired schoolteacher, who listened to Ibitayo's story. \"We don't solve problems for them,\" Kelly said. \"Sometimes you don't realize that you can be your own problem solver. And when they finish, we want them to leave empowered.\"",
      "A screening process refers more serious cases to professionals. For almost 20 years now, Dr. Chibanda has been using his medical training to help analyze and improve the program. \"The Friendship Bench is actually rooted in a lot of research,\" he said. \"These grandmas were a lot more effective than trained mental health professionals at alleviating symptoms of both depression and generalized anxiety disorders.\"",
      "Arnette Ibitayo said she felt better after just one session with Kelly: \"I was more at ease. It worked. It was working.\"",
      "\"You feel a little less depressed now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, uh-huh. There's hope that things are going to be better.\"",
      "So, what's the special sauce when it comes to grandparents? According to Chibanda, it is \"the natural abilities that come with having a long-lived life on the planet. They've seen a lot. They've experienced a lot. They have, you know, the battle scars of life, which they bring to the bench. All we're doing as Friendship Bench is helping them to use those stories, those experiences, to help others.\"",
      "And the bench is giving them something back. Theresa Kelly said, \"I love helping people, empowering people. It makes me feel good.

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:44:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The CDC says respiratory illness is now \"very high\" nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "Levels of influenza nationwide are now at the highest they have been since the peak of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, according to figures published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, amid this winter's second wave of the virus.",
      "Close to 8% of visits for respiratory illness to outpatient providers, including urgent cares and doctors offices, reported to the CDC this week were people sick with influenza. That is the worst on record in the CDC's influenza surveillance network since late 2009, during the swine flu pandemic.",
      "While most flu seasons usually see a resurgence of infections after the winter holidays, this winter's flu wave has now reached unusually high levels compared to recent years.",
      "That has driven overall levels of respiratory illness to \"very high\" levels for the first time this season, despite a smaller and now-decreasing wave of COVID-19 in recent months.",
      "Other influenza metrics are also far above recent peaks nationwide, including in emergency rooms and from testing laboratories. Data collected by the CDC from labs found 31.6% of tests last week were positive for influenza, close to double the 18.2% at last season's peak.",
      "The CDC says that most states are at \"high\" or \"very high\" levels of influenza activity, though some states may have now reached their peak.",
      "Influenza infections are \"likely growing\" in 15 states, the agency's disease forecasters predict, and are either now flat or starting to decline in most other states.",
      "One of the states where influenza is \"likely growing\" is Kentucky, where pediatric infectious specialist Dr. Kris Bryant says she's seeing \"extraordinarily high numbers\" of positive cases in children. At Norton Children's Hospital, there were 3,000 positive cases just last week, she said, calling the uptick \"worrisome.\"",
      "\"We tend to focus on flu as a respiratory viral illness, but some parents don't realize that it can cause seizures, even rarely an inflammation of the brain, and pediatricians are reporting cases of that across the U.S.,\" Bryant said.",
      "Flu vaccination rates in children is at its lowest level in six years, according to the CDC. This year, fewer than half of Americans have been vaccinated. Bryant suspects \"vaccine hesitancy\" could be playing a role in the trend.",
      "Unlike the 2009 pandemic, lab tests around the country suggest cases are still from the usual seasonal variants of the virus, and not a new strain that has spilled over from animals.",
      "While farms have been grappling with a record surge of H5N1 bird flu in poultry driving up egg prices, and a new potentially lethal strain in dairy cows, only a handful of human cases have been confirmed from bird flu in the U.S. Investigations have linked cases to direct contact with sick animals, not human-to-human transmission.",

    "summary": "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration political appointees have taken steps in recent weeks to exert unprecedented influence over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's flagship medical research publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News. The interference included dictating what to cover and withholding studies on the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "The Trump administration's moves to control the research published by the agency ends a decades-long streak of independence for the journal, known as the MMWR.",
      "Health officials and experts have long considered the MMWR as the \"voice of CDC\" and a respected source where federal scientists release research of public health importance. It ranks as among the most-cited health journals in the world.",
      "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
      "Efforts by Trump officials to control the publication have stalled the release of three studies about bird flu for weeks, as the virus continues spreading through wild birds, poultry farms and cows around the country.",
      "That delay was initially attributed to the communications \"pause\" ordered by the Department of Health and Human Services, which stalled many releases across the government.",
      "Spokespeople for the CDC and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump officials initially said the gag order was needed for the administration to catch up in staffing its public relations team to oversee the vast amount of communications coming out of the nations' federal health agencies.",
      "But as that pause has started to lift, Trump officials at HHS, and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez, refused repeated requests by career health officials to publish the completed research, officials say.",
      "The stalled research includes findings about pet cats owned by dairy workers being infected with bird flu, plus wastewater testing results and antibody testing of cow veterinarians.",
      "Instead, health officials say Monarez relayed orders by the Trump administration to come up with research to publish this week about the health risks from wildfires, days after President Trump criticized California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's handling of fires in the state.",
      "Federal scientists say they scrambled to find studies to comply with the order, which was unexpected and not related to any studies that had been scheduled to come out.",
      "The research that was ultimately published looked at exposure to worrying chemicals for firefighters who responded to the 2023 wildfires in Hawaii and emergency room visits in Los Angeles during the wildfires.",
      "Multiple health officials said they complied fearing their jobs. Scientists within the agency say they have been bombarded with daily requests to accept the \"fork in the road\" offer to resign by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0task force, headed by Elon Musk.",
      "Glimpse at a study taken offline",
      "A technical glitch resulted in a table from one of the bird flu studies accidentally being published on Thursday, before officials scrambled to take it down.",
      "That bird flu study was supposed to lay out the details of an investigation into how two indoor cats could have contracted the virus. One of the cats' owners was a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized raw milk, which health officials warn is one of the main ways that H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading between farms in the U.S.",
      "Multiple federal health officials and outside experts have unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to allow the publication to maintain its independence, citing the importance of allowing federal public health researchers to publish their findings without fearing political interference.",
      "While researchers often have to jump through multiple hoops of \"clearance\" within the agency to satisfy questions and concerns raised by scientists and career health officials about the accuracy of their research, officials said political appointees usually steered clear of meddling in its content.",
      "Now health officials fear that a precedent has been set for the Trump administration to cross further lines in its attempts to influence the research and data published by the CDC.",
      "Previous efforts by Trump-appointed officials to exert control over the publication came under scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Mr. Trump's first term, after aides sought to influence reports at the time.",
      "It is now unclear to co-authors of the bird flu research outside the agency when the research will ever be published, weeks after it was ready to go.",
      "\"The study is completed and was to be published in MMWR last month until the order from the new administration halted communication from CDC,\" K. Fred Gingrich II, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said in an email.",
      "The association had worked with Ohio's health department and the CDC to sample\u00a0the blood of veterinarians who treat cows at an annual conference late last year, looking for antibodies that would help answer an outstanding question: had bird flu cases infected veterinarians under the radar?",

The recalled ranges have been involved in more than 28 fires, with at least five causing extensive property damage totaling more than $340,000. At least eight minor injuries have been reported, including burns, and at least three of the fires involved the deaths of pets, according to the federal agency.",

With USAID funding paused, there is concern among U.S. farmers about the market for some of their products, including Kansas sorghum producers, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal.",

      "Starbucks faces a new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleging the restaurant chain relies on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices\" that violate federal and state laws. The complaint\u00a0also claims the coffee chain's hiring policies have led to slower service and higher prices for consumers because it isn't recruiting the most qualified workers.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, claims Starbucks' diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies are \"mere pretext for its actual commitment to unlawful discrimination.\"",
      "The litigation comes just weeks after President Trump signed an executive order\u00a0banning diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0programs across the U.S. government, while also directing the U.S. attorney general to \"encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "A number of major retailers and other companies, along with other organizations, have recently rolled back their DEI initiatives amid pushback from conservative activists, including Ford, Google, McDonald's, Meta, Target and Walmart.",

We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\"",
      "The company added, \"Our hiring practices are inclusive fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time.\"",
      "Critics of DEI say employers should make their hiring decisions based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other legally protected categories. The Missouri lawsuit echoes those arguments, alleging that Starbucks' hiring practices discriminates against residents of the state.",
      "\"Starbucks' policies harm the many Missourians whom work, or would like to work, at Starbucks, but have been, are being or will be discriminated against as future victims on the basis of their race, sex, or inclusion in other protected groups,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "While Starbucks' prices and wait times have been a focus of consumer complaints in recent years, experts haven't generally blamed hiring practices for the chain's problems. Instead, analysts have pointed to inflation, which has pushed up the prices of ingredients like coffee and milk, as well as Starbucks' vast number of drink customizations, which can slow orders.",

Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",

      "Quincey said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that if the tariffs go into effect, making aluminum cans more expensive, the company could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "Quincey also said the impact of the new tariffs could be negligible.",
      "\"I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion dollar U.S. business, and packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure.\"",
      "Coke could also start sourcing aluminum domestically, and raise consumer prices. Quincey noted that Coke already has \"hedging programs\" in place.",
      "\"As the relative prices of different sources of ingredients and imports change, of course we look at mitigation, productivity, efficiency, adjusting where we get our materials from. All of that goes into the equation to constantly manage how this goes through,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 06:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Monday ordered new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. Experts say some products could become pricier.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is again turning to tariffs to advance his trade agenda, signing new orders to place 25% import duties on all steel and aluminum imports. Although the idea is to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair competition, consumers could end up paying more for some products that use the metals, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump, who signed two executive orders on Monday imposing the new metal tariffs, has said that such duties can help revitalize key U.S. industries. For instance, some companies could opt to open new plants in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, while buyers could shift to U.S.-made products rather than pricier imports.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands we need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "The new metal tariffs affect a total of about $50 billion in imports. The U.S. imports roughly a quarter of domestically used steel, with most of it sourced from Canada and Mexico, along with countries including Brazil, South Korea and Japan, according to the International Trade Administration.",
      "Who pays for tariffs",
      "Because U.S. importers pay tariffs on overseas goods directly to the federal government, the costs are typically passed onto American consumers, trade experts told CBS MoneyWatch. That means some products that rely on steel and aluminum, such as vehicles and appliances, are likely to become more expensive if the steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"If you put a tax on imported steel and aluminum, you will raise the price of everything that uses that \u2014 cars first and foremost,\" said Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research.",
      "A typical car contains roughly 1,000 pounds of steel at a cost of about about $6,000 to $7,000 per vehicle, Baker told CBS MoneyWatch. That means adding a 25% tariff could increase the cost of a car by $1,000 to $1,500, he estimated. Although some automakers might shift to buying more U.S.-made steel, American manufacturers would also likely boost their prices, taking advantage of the higher costs for foreign-made steel, he added.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. car prices could rise even more sharply if Mr. Trump proceeds with 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian imports, now subject to a 30-day pause\u00a0as officials negotiate. The impact of those tariffs would\u00a0add $6,250 to the average $25,000 price of a car shipped into the U.S. from those two countries, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Under Mr. Trump's orders, steel imports from all countries will now face 25% tariffs, while aluminum tariffs will be raised from 10% to 25%. The orders were instituted under\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the president to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are determined to threaten national security.",
      "Tariffs could drive up inflation",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2014 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that, in addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs, he planned to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on Tuesday or Wednesday, which he said will take effect immediately. Under that scenario, the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods.",
      "\"If they charge us, we charge them \u2026 every country,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.\"",
      "Economists and Wall Street analysts warn that new U.S. tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to flare even as many Americans say they continue struggling with the cost of living. Mr. Trump's latest proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, plus the reciprocal tariffs, could boost the core personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 a key measure of inflation \u2014 by an additional 0.4 percentage points, Deutsche Bank economists estimate in a Feb. 10 research report.",
      "If the postponed tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada go into effect after the 30-day pause, inflation could rise higher than 3.5%, they added.",
      "The long-term impact on U.S. prices is less certain and is contingent on how manufacturers react.",
      "\"U.S. steel prices will likely rise in the near term if these tariffs are implemented in full,\" economists with Capital Economics said in a report. \"However, higher prices might incentivize greater domestic production and help prices to fall back before long.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, steel producers increased their output after tariffs were imposed, while domestic demand fell. Within 12 months, those factors contributed to steel prices declining to their level before the tariffs were imposed, Capital Economics noted.",
      "A jump in prices, coupled with rising inflation expectations, would come at an awkward time for consumers and for Mr. Trump. While he has received positive approval ratings for his first three weeks in office, two-thirds of voters said that they don't believe he's doing enough to lower the price of goods and services, according to a recent CBS News poll.",
      "Inflation around the U.S. remains sticky, with the Federal Reserve pausing additional interest rate cuts until the rate of consumer price gains falls closer to its 2% annual target. Consumer Price Index data for January, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, is expected to show that prices rose 2.9% in January, unchanged from the prior month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",

      "The national average for a dozen roses this Valentine's Day is $90.50. That's a 2% increase from last year, according to FinanceBuzz.",
      "\"A lot goes into flower prices \u2014 it's not solely the rise in the price of goods, but more of a function of an entire agricultural system that relies on transportation, logistics, and of course, weather,\" Josh Koebert, a senior researcher at FinanceBuzz, said in an email.",
      "He said prices this year are more in line with inflation, versus last year when there were other factors like \"erratic weather patterns impacting flower production around the world, increased costs associated with shipping and the supply chain post-COVID, and general increased demand for plants and flowers.\"",

      "The journey of a rose from the farm to the consumer is a meticulous process that involves multiple stages, Penn said.",
      "\"It begins with breeders who invest years in developing commercially viable roses. These roses are cultivated for their rich, pigmented colors, beautiful bloom shapes, and long vase life,\" Penn said. \"Beyond aesthetics, breeders focus on ensuring the roses are disease-resistant and durable enough to withstand transportation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A union representing employees across dozens of federal agencies filed two lawsuits on Sunday against the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with one seeking to block the apparent shutdown of the agency and another aimed at stopping Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing employee records and information.",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency established by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from corporate fraud and scams. President Trump named Russell Vought, the Senate-confirmed head of the Office of Management and Budget, to run the CFPB on an acting basis after firing its previous director.",
      "Over the weekend, Vought\u00a0ordered\u00a0the bureau's staff to halt almost all of their work, continuing the administration's ongoing blitz of the federal bureaucracy. Vought directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, halt all stakeholder engagements and abstain from issuing public communications.",
      "In one of its lawsuits, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 155,000 federal employees across three dozen agencies and departments, asked the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia to rule that Vought's directive that CFPB employees halt work is unlawful. The lawsuit cited Musk's Feb. 7 post on X, in which he wrote \"CFPB RIP\" with an emoji of a tombstone.",
      "\"CFPB employees have been placed in questionable status as they have been directed not to work but they have also not been formally placed on any authorized type of leave,\" the NTEU said. \"It is substantially likely that these initial directives are a precursor to a purge of CFPB's workforce, which is now prohibited from fulfilling the agency's statutory mission.\"",
      "The union asked the court to \"[declare] that Defendant Vought's directive to the CFPB's employees to stop their supervision and enforcement work is unlawful\" and \"[e]njoin Defendant Vought from further attempts to halt the CFPB's supervision and enforcement work.\"",
      "The\u00a0second NTEU lawsuit suggests the administration has violated the Privacy Act, which prohibits CFPB from disclosing employee records, by granting DOGE access \"without employee consent.\" The suit asks the federal court in D.C. to stop CFPB from granting DOGE access to those records.",
      "\"CFPB has a statutory responsibility to protect the information that it collects and maintains about its employees from unlawful disclosure to third parties,\" the suit said. \"The Bureau has acted contrary to law and regulation by granting DOGE and its members access to the records that the Bureau collects and maintains about every CFPB employee.\"",
      "The CFPB was established through the Dodd-Frank Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in July 2010. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, spearheaded the CFPB's creation.",
      "The CFPB has been a sore point for conservatives ever since its founding, with GOP lawmakers saying it has issued burdensome regulations and rules. Supporters of the bureau point out that it has returned tens of billions of dollars to consumers through its enforcement actions.",
      "A 2024 Supreme Court ruling upheld the constitutionality of CFPB's funding structure, after challengers argued that its funding mechanism violated the Constitution's Appropriations Clause. The court determined in a\u00a07-2 decision\u00a0that CFPB's funding structure complies with the Constitution.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency wants to cut government spending, but it's also prompting lawsuits and concerns about data privacy.",
    "story": [
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, was created by President Trump on Jan. 20 with a mission to slash federal spending. Since then, the task force led by billionaire Elon Musk says it has saved more than $1 billion by canceling diversity, equity and inclusion contracts, among other expenses, according to DOGE's social media account.",
      "But since kicking into gear on Jan. 20, DOGE has also prompted several lawsuits and raised alarms from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "Supporters of DOGE see its efforts as a way to rein in bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outpacing its tax revenue, causing the federal debt to spiral to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. Mr. Trump has said he wants to cut programs that don't align with his policies and to slash the federal workforce.",
      "\"@DOGE is trying to STOP your tax dollars from being stolen for WASTE and FRAUD,\" Musk posted on X, his social media app, on Feb. 4.",
      "Critics of the task force say that Musk, who runs companies including SpaceX that receive billions in government contracts, could be engaged in work through DOGE that may pose conflicts of interest with his private businesses, such as potentially gaining access to data about competitors' federal contracts.",
      "A Feb. 3 lawsuit filed by two unions and an advocacy group for older Americans alleges that the Treasury Department has unlawfully provided Musk and DOGE with the private personal data of most U.S. taxpayers.",
      "Here's what to know about DOGE's operations and its role within the Trump administration.",
      "What is DOGE?",
      "The acronym DOGE is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke in 2021 by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin, whose price can be volatile, has shed about one-third of its value since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.)",
      "When Mr. Trump launched DOGE through an executive order last month, he housed it within the executive branch, rather than creating it as an outside advisory committee. The order said that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on government technology projects and that exists within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \u2014 would be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "The executive order also noted that a DOGE team of at least four employees, which could include special government employees, would be assigned to each agency, such as the Department of Labor or the Treasury Department. Those groups were to each include one team leader, one engineer, one human resources specialist and one attorney.",
      "Those teams are tasked with \"a software modernization initiative to improve the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, network infrastructure, and information technology (IT) systems,\" according to Mr. Trump's order. The teams would also to advise the agencies \"on implementing the President's DOGE Agenda,\" the executive order states.",
      "Setting DOGE up within an existing tech-focused unit within OMB is \"quite interesting,\" said Robert Burton, a former OMB official who spoke recently at a webinar about DOGE hosted by George Mason University.",
      "\"This works perfectly for DOGE's services \u2014 it's really the same type of mission, bringing in these really smart people from the private sector\" to work on government tech, Burton said.",
      "Is Elon Musk a government employee?",
      "Musk is classified as a \"special government employee,\" Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone \"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role, created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, can be either paid or unpaid. Because Musk \u2014 who is ranked as the world's wealthiest person, with a fortune Bloomberg estimates at more than $400 billion \u2014 is not paid for his work as an SGE, he doesn't need to file a public financial disclosure report.",
      "What has DOGE done so far?",
      "According to social media posts from DOGE and Musk, the task force is seeking to identify federal contracts and spending on issues that don't align with Mr. Trump's policies, including DEI and foreign aid.",
      "\"DOGE has now saved taxpayers over $1 billion in crazy DEI contracts,\" Musk wrote on Jan. 30.",
      "Musk wrote in a November opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that he and his then DOGE co-partner Vivek Ramaswamy aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal spending. That would represent about 7% of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual expenditures.",
      "Experts warn that deep spending cuts could prove problematic, given that about two-thirds of government spending is directed toward Social Security, Medicare, national defense and Medicaid. While on the campaign trail before the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare, which provide retirement and health benefits for millions of senior citizens.",
      "What is DOGE doing at the Treasury?",
      "DOGE recently sparked an outcry from some taxpayers, Democratic lawmakers and government watchdogs after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which is handled by a little-known unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "The Bureau of the Fiscal Service disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks, tax refunds and federal salaries. In pointing to some ways it is saving taxpayer money, DOGE has said in social media\u00a0posts that it has nixed DEI contracts at the Treasury, as well as canceled the agency's subscriptions to the New York Times.",
      "DOGE's access to sensitive financial data has raised concerns about the potential for errors, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, writing in a Feb. 2 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that providing DOGE with access to the systems is \"risking missteps that could result in a global financial meltdown that costs trillions of dollars and millions of jobs.\"",
      "Others have flagged data security risks tied to DOGE's access to taxpayers' personal information, such as bank account data and Social Security numbers.",
      "\"The scale of the intrusion into individuals' privacy is massive and unprecedented,\" the Feb. 3 lawsuit from the unions claimed. \"Secretary Bessent's action granting DOGE-affiliated individuals full, continuous and ongoing access to that information for an unspecified period of time means that retirees, taxpayers, federal employees, companies and other individuals from all walks of life have no assurance that their information will receive the protection that federal law affords.\"",
      "Musk \"has abided by all federal laws,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "DOGE's work so far has sparked multiple lawsuits, with groups including federal employee unions and government watchdogs suing over issues including data security. On Feb. 8, a federal judge in New York blocked the task force from accessing Treasury records that contain sensitive personal data such as Social Security for millions of Americans.",
      "What is DOGE doing with USAID?",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have also taken aim at the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, upending an organization that\u00a0provides humanitarian aid\u00a0to more than 100 countries.",
      "Both men contend that much of the 60-year-old agency's spending is wasteful. Supporters of the agency say USAID is essential for national security, countering influence from U.S. rivals, while also providing critical humanitarian assistance across the globe.",
      "Officials working with DOGE sought access to the Treasury's payment system to stop money from flowing to USAID, the Associated Press reported, citing to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "In a Feb. 4 letter to lawmakers, Treasury officials said DOGE's technical capacity is limited to viewing payments data, while federal expenditures have not been affected.",
      "What is DOGE doing with Social Security?",
      "DOGE said in a Feb. 5 post on social media that the Social Security Administration had \"terminated its contract for the 'Gender X initiative marker' and removed all references to gender ideology from public facing applications.\" The task force said the effort would save about $1 million.",
      "A potentially larger issue is DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment system because it processes the Social Security payments for more than 70 million people and contains the Social Security numbers of most Americans.",
      "Musk and his team \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, said on Feb. 3.",
      "The Treasury says DOGE has been given \"read only\" access to its payment system.",
      "A federal judge on Feb. 7 also was scheduled to consider whether to block DOGE from accessing computer systems at the Labor Department. A group of labor unions has filed suit to deny DOGE employees entry to those systems, which the plaintiffs allege contain sensitive information about federal employees, including which workers has investigated Musk's companies.",
      "The Labor Department also has confidential information about companies that compete with Musk's enterprises, including SpaceX and Tesla, the suit claims. The Justice Department said there's no proof of wrongdoing and that the judge shouldn't issue sweeping order \"based on plaintiffs' rank speculation that DOL will violate the law.\"",
      "What is DOGE doing with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?",
      "DOGE has gained access to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, and has started a thorough review of the independent government agency designed to protect consumers from corporate fraud and scams.",
      "The task force has gained access to the internal systems, including personnel rolls and financial records of the agency, according to two sources directly familiar with their review. The CFPB was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as a way to help consumers with complaints about financial products such as credit cards.",
      "The CFPB has also created new rules for financial institutions and products to target a number of financial pitfalls that can hurt consumers. For instance, the agency has barred unpaid medical bills from appearing on credit reports, given that such bills can hurt a consumer's ability to get a mortgage or other type of loans.",
      "Musk posted \"RIP CFPB\" on his\u00a0X social media\u00a0platform on Friday, and the main website for the independent government agency is now down with a 404 message appearing when one clicks on it, although other reports and data remain accessible.",

    "summary": "President Trump's firing of one of the National Labor Relations Board's five members has left the labor watchdog adrift, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's firing of a member at the National Labor Relations Board leaves the federal agency unable to perform its duties protecting the rights of U.S. workers and monitoring union elections, according to labor experts.",
      "The agency is now down to two members, one below the minimum required to fully function, labor attorneys said, even as one of the country's largest companies, Amazon, presses the NLRB to void the results of a recent union election due to the board's downsizing.",
      "\"Right now the NLRB is not operational because there are only two out of five board members and the Supreme Court has ruled that they cannot operate with less than three members,\" Cathy Creighton, director of Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab. and a former field attorney for the NLRB, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Congress set up the\u00a0NLRB\u00a0in 1935, during the Great Depression, to safeguard employee rights to collective bargaining. It oversees secret-ballot union elections and works to prevent and address unfair labor practices by private-sector employers and unions.",
      "Illegal firing?",
      "The Jan. 27 ouster of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox came as a shock and left the independent federal agency without the required number of members to function.",
      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, told CBS News\u00a0in an interview\u00a0Thursday.",
      "Wilcox is suing Mr. Trump, alleging the president exceeded his authority in firing her and requesting that she be reinstated as an NLRB member. Her firing runs counter to a \"Supreme Court precedent that has ensured the independence of critical government agencies,\" according to the\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
      "The president's bid to oust her from her Senate-confirmed position is \"unlawful and unprecedented,\" Wilcox said in a\u00a0statement.\u00a0 \"When Congress established the National Labor Relations Board almost 90 years ago, it made sure that the law would protect its independence from political influence. My removal, without cause or process, directly violates that law.\"",
      "Appointed to the NLRB in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in September 2023 to serve another term through 2028, Wilcox was told in a letter that she had not performed \"in a matter consistent with the objectives\" of the president.",
      "The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Wilcox's firing seems \"an illegal termination,\" with no notice or hearing, Cornell's Creighton said, noting that federal law prohibits a president from getting rid of board members except in case of negligence or malfeasance.",
      "How it affects workers",
      "Some of the NLRB's day-to-day work can continue, but the board itself \"can't order parties to pay remedies or recognize a union,\" said Matthew Bodie, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota. \"There are some people who are concerned that the Trump administration will take its time to fill those three positions, or not fill them at all, so it renders the agency toothless at some level.\"",
      "\"We've never had this particular situation where it's been rendered inoperative for lack of a quorum and what that means for workers,\" added John Logan, a labor historian and professor at San Francisco State University's Lam Family College of Business. \"Do they exist only if there's a bureaucratic framework to enforce them?\" he asked of the legal protections granted workers.",
      "Whole Foods union effort in jeopardy",
      "The NLRB's lack of a quorum is reason to overturn the results of a Jan. 27 election that had workers at a Whole Foods store in Philadelphia\u00a0voting to unionize, the Amazon-owned grocery chain said in\u00a0objections\u00a0filed with the NLRB on Monday.",
      "Whole Foods has accused the local union of not playing by the rules.",
      "\"The UFCW 1776 illegally interfered with our team members' right to a fair vote at our Philly Center City Store. We have filed objections to these illegal actions and have asked the NLRB to set aside the results of the election,\" Whole Foods told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "The filings by Whole Foods are in line with tactics employed by its corporate parent, the UFCW said.",
      "\"It's similar to what they filed in other Amazon cases around the country,\" UFCW Local 1776 President Wendell Young IV told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This company is going to take advantage of Trump cleaning house,\" Young said.",
      "Amazon and Whole Foods are delaying in hopes of getting a business-friendlier NLRB, or \"that ultimately the Supreme Court will have a different view than past courts,\" he added of lawsuits filed by Amazon and Elon Musk's SpaceX challenging the NLRB's structure as unconstitutional.",
      "\"This might be an existential moment\" for the U.S. labor movement, Bodie said.",

    "story": [
      "The Philadelphia Eagles secured the championship in Sunday's Super Bowl 59, but there were also several winners \u2014 and plenty of losers \u2014 in the lineup of star-studded commercials that aired during the broadcast. The best Super Bowl LIX ads delivered strong messages, either through humor or drama, while the worst commercials left some viewers befuddled, experts said.",
      "There's a lot on the line for Super Bowl advertisers, with a few ad spots selling for a record $8 million and even $8 million-plus for 30 seconds. Last year, a 30-second spot\u00a0sold for about $7 million. Advertisers also spend additional millions on creating their ads, often hiring well-known actors or celebrities to appear in their spots.",
      "Super Bowl commercials that score can pay off for a company through new customers and a stronger brand image, but ads that fumble can tarnish a business's marketing message and even turn off consumers. Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, said Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management who co-runs its annual Super Bowl ad ranking.",
      "The finalized crop of commercials feature a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.",
      "\"That's the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,\" Calkins said. \"Safe advertising isn't the advertising you notice or remember.\"",
      "This year's crop of ads included some that dropped the ball, according to Northwestern marketing professor Derek Rucker, who co-runs the Kellogg ad review with Calkins.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: Coffee Mate",
      "One of this year's worst ads was the spot from Coffee Mate, Kellogg's ad review found. That spot featured two men sitting on the couch when one of them puts Coffee Mate's cold foam on his drink. His tongue then leaps out of his mouth and dances along to music and fireworks.",
      "\"The brand showcased dancing tongues, which included jumping out of a person's mouth,\" Rucker told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The spot was distracting and the brand's message got lost as a result, he said.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: Tubi",
      "Another commercial that was voted as one of this year's worst by the panel was the Tubi ad, Rucker said. That spot, for the Tubi streaming service, featured people with fleshy hat-like appendages, with the main character born with a cowboy-shaped head. The ad was \"good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,\" according to Collider.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: ChatGPT",
      "ChatGPT's ad was also a low-rated ad, according to Northwestern's ad panel. Its spot showed the evolution of human tech through black-and-white pixelated images, but the business school gave it poor marks because it didn't show viewers anything new. The ad cost $14 million to air in the first half, according to tech publication The Verge.",
      "\"It's understandable given that, with the amount of money invested in the spot, the audience really was given very little new information about ChatGPT. It's almost as if it simply showed up the party not knowing what to do,\" Rucker said.",
      "Best Super Bowl commercial: Michelob Ultra",
      "This spot features actors Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara as they hustle younger players out of their Michelob Ultra beers by wagering that they can beat them at pickleball. \"Play you for an Ultra?\" O'Hara asks at the end of the commercial.",
      "\"Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara appeared together and showcased their hustle\u2014 and hustling\u2014 for Michelob Ultra. It's got just the right balance between brand and celebrity, and it resonated with our panel,\" Rucker said.",
      "Best Super Bowl commercial: Google",
      "The Google ad featured a dad preparing for a job interview, who turns to Google's Gemini AI app to help him craft a description of the most challenging job he's had \u2014 being a dad.",
      "\"Google once again impressed our panel with a spot that showcased both the functionality of its phone and added its own emotional twist,\" Rucker said.",

    "summary": "Brands paid millions to air their commercials during Super Bowl 2025. Here's what's behind the cost, and why advertisers say it's worth it.",
    "story": [
      "On the eve of Super Bowl 59, the\u00a0Philadelphia Eagles\u00a0and\u00a0Kansas City Chiefs\u00a0aren't the only ones dreaming of touchdowns. Brands and advertisers with millions riding on the success of commercials to be aired during the 2025 Super Bowl broadcast are also hoping to score. Here's a look at how much money goes into Super Bowl ads, and why advertisers say the high-cost commercials are worth it.",
      "How much do Super Bowl commercials cost on average for 2025?",
      "Advertisers are shelling out close to $8 million on average for a 30-second spot during Super Bowl LIX, Peter Bray, founder and executive creative director at ad agency Bray & Co., told CBS MoneyWatch. He estimates that around 51 minutes of advertising has been sold for the approximately three to four hour broadcast this year, making the total amount of ad sales somewhere in the hundreds of millions.",

      "Want to watch Super Bowl 2025 commercials early? These ads are already live.",
      "The close to $8 million price tag is almost a million dollars more than the $7 million it cost for a 30-second spot in Super Bowl 2024. Commercial air time during the NFL Championship in 2023 was also about $7 million for 30 seconds, a 55% jump from 2019. Super Bowl advertising costs are \"creeping up,\" said Bray, who believes ad sales for the broadcast will soon reach $1 billion.",
      "\"I think in three years it's going to hit a billion dollars in ad sales. And that has never before happened on the planet. That is the immensity of this event,\" he said.",
      "Why are Super Bowl ads so expensive?",
      "\"It's the advertising industry's Super Bowl as well,\" Bray said. \"It's the one time of year where the general public actually cares about advertising so it's an exciting time.\"",
      "And social media, he says, has only made the broadcast more important.",
      "\"It's actually made advertising in the Super Bowl more relevant than ever because what's happened is with all these different platforms, it's very difficult to find a large audience at once,\" Bray said. \"Someone might advertise as an advertiser on TikTok, or on Instagram ... all of these different advertising opportunities. But you might be duplicating because the audience on TikTok, maybe 90% are the same audience on Instagram, so there's a lot of duplication.\"",
      "More than 120 million people are expected to watch Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, which will be broadcast on Fox and\u00a0livestreamed for free\u00a0on Tubi. To keep those viewers transfixed, brands will try to use humor, emotion or a famous actor to create a cultural moment that a mass audience can engage with collectively.",
      "\"Comedy can be a safe route for brands, and you don't want to divide your audience at all, so comedy makes sense. There's more celebrities being used than ever,\" Bray said.",
      "Depending on a celebrity's level of fame, they can add anywhere from less than $50,000 for a brief cameo to millions of dollars. Bray said he estimates the tab for most stars that appear in a Super Bowl spot to be in the $2 million range.",
      "Dunkin' spends big \u2014 and wins",
      "For his role in a Dunkin' ad last year, meanwhile, Ben Affleck was paid nearly $10 million, CNN reported; it was his second appearance in a Super Bowl commercial for the global donut and coffee giant.",
      "Dunkin' first featured Affleck \u2014 a Boston native and actual Dunkin' donuts fan \u2014 in its inaugural Super Bowl ad in 2023. The 30-second spot, which included a cameo of his then wife, Jennifer Lopez, garnered 7 billion impressions for the company after its first airing, according to Dunkin' President Scott Murphy in a 2024 interview with Entreprenuer magazine. The ad was produced by\u00a0 Artists Equity, a company founded by Affleck and Matt Damon in 2022.",
      "A multipart campaign followed,\u00a0including\u00a0a promotion featuring Gen Z rapper Ice Spice. The storyline culminated with Dunkin's 2024 Super Bowl ad, a comedic 60-second spot that introduces the characters The DunKings, an aspirational rap group Affleck forms with Matt Damon and Tom Brady, dressed in bright orange and pink track suits.",
      "One year and many\u00a0sold-out track suits later, Dunkin' and Affleck return for their third Super Bowl ad collaboration, which\u00a0features\u00a0Casey Affleck and \"Succession\" star Jeremy Strong.",
      "\"Ben Affleck is a great combination with Dunkin',\" said Bray, \"Not because of him as an actor or director, but how he's perceived in popular culture. \"Jeremy Strong from 'Succession,' he's a kooky guy, but he's known as a method actor. Dunkin' know this ... they're connecting who these celebrities are as people rather than actors to the brands. And that makes for a really powerful ad.\"",
      "How much did Super Bowl commercials cost in past years?",
      "Super Bowl ads go back to the first Super Bowl in 1967. Two networks aired the game, with a 30-second spot costing $37,500 on NBC and $42,500 on CBS, according to a timeline of ad prices listed on SportingNews.com. Ad prices for the most part have steadily increased since then, with the cost for a half-minute ad breaking $1 million in 1995 and reaching $5 million in 2017.",
      "What is the most expensive Super Bowl ad ever aired?",
      "The most expensive Super Bowl commercial of all time is Amazon's \"Mind Reader\" ad, which aired during Super Bowl LVI in 2022. Featuring real-life couple Scarlett Johansson and comedian Colin Jost from \"SNL,\" the 90-second spot is reported to have cost $26 million to produce, according to experience management site Qualtrics.",
      "What is the cheapest Super Bowl ad ever aired?",
      "The cheapest Super Bowl ad ever made appears to be a commercial by a startup company called LifeMinders.com that aired in 2000. The 30-second ad was made by three internal freelancers with a budget of less than $5,000, according to video marketing platform Wistia.",
      "Offering \"highly personalized emails on topics you ask for,\" the endearingly low-budget spot drew 700,000 people to its website in the week following the Super Bowl, according to AdAge. Sadly, it appears the company is no longer in business as the domain name is listed as\u00a0available.",

      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",

      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",

      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",

It's the Patriots against Falcons in Super Bowl LI \u2026 the Red Sox against the Yankees \u2026 the Heat against the Spurs \u2026 and every damn sports movie ever made. The scoreboard makes for a grim canvas. Time is winding down. All looks lost. But one team refuses to concede.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration, in a letter Thursday, directed states to stop spending money for EV charging infrastructure \u2014 funds that had been allocated under former President Joe Biden. President Trump has slammed federal funding for electric vehicle chargers as \"an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "But the administration may need an act of Congress to freeze the states' spending, and it's not clear there will be one. Industry leaders say customer demand will continue to drive growth in the charging network, regardless of federal funding.",
      "The Tesla Supercharger network \u2014 led by CEO Elon Musk, now leading Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 has received millions of dollars through the program that was just halted. But it also has a massive footprint of chargers across the country. Tesla will continue expanding its network regardless of federal money and is likely to benefit from its competitors receiving fewer funds.",
      "Trump and EV charging",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump paused billions in funding for a nationwide buildout of fast electric car chargers that had been allocated to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula program.",
      "Then the Federal Highway Administration, the Transportation Department agency that administers NEVI funding, told states Thursday to stop carrying out their plans, pending new guidelines. It's part of the broader effort to dismantle many environmental policies and incentives put in place by the Biden administration.",
      "Some states, like Alabama and Rhode Island, had already suspended their programs in response to the Inauguration Day order, but Thursday's directive is a further push from the Trump administration to halt federal efforts to electrify the roads and reduce planet-warming emissions from transportation.",
      "States that currently have NEVI-funded projects up and running mostly have been reimbursed by the federal government. But the new memo means states with projects in the works, or those currently contracting for them, are to be halted immediately, and they don't know if or when they will be able to proceed and request reimbursement.",
      "Impact on EV drivers in the U.S.",
      "NEVI was created through the Biden administration's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed by Congress in 2021, to fill gaps in the EV charging infrastructure network. It addresses the concern many car buyers have for road trips where charging stations are too far apart.",
      "The NEVI program awards states $5 billion over five years, but they've struggled with permitting delays, complicated electrical upgrades and contracting.",
      "Estimates suggest $3.3 billion of NEVI funding had already gone out the door to states.",

      "This announcement creates uncertainty, said Ryan Gallentine, managing director at business association Advanced Energy United.",
      "\"Most of the unawarded money is sitting in state Department of Transportation bank accounts ready to be spent,\" Gallentine said in a statement. States are under no obligation to stop these projects based solely on this announcement, he said. \"We call on state DOTs and program administrators to continue executing this program until new guidance is finalized.\"",
      "Others say the effort is sure to trigger legal battles.",
      "The administration has \"no legal basis\" for stopping plans that have already been approved and funded, said Andrew Wishnia, former deputy assistant secretary for climate policy at the DOT who helped author the NEVI program.",
      "Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, a company that tracks EV charging data, predicted EV range concerns will linger for drivers. \"If you don't have convenient access either where you live or where you work or in between, why would you get an EV? It just doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "Money that was leftover after states met their highway obligations was meant to fill other gaps in charging: areas where there are low rates of EVs, including low-income areas or areas with a lot of apartment buildings where it hard for people to charge.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 17:32:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's list of tax priorities includes eliminating a loophole that benefits private equity firms, hedge funds and other big investors.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is proposing to eliminate a tax loophole that's also a long-time target of some Democratic lawmakers.",
      "Mr. Trump is working on \"no tax on seniors' Social Security, no tax on overtime pay\" as well as renewing the tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Jan. 6. But, she added, the president also wants to abolish the \"carried interest tax deduction loophole.\"",
      "The latter tax break might not be well-known to many Americans given that it's predominantly used by hedge funds, private equity firms and other types of investment funds. That loophole allows investment managers to greatly lower their taxable income, a major perk for investors whose annual earnings can mount into the billions.",
      "Carried interest refers to the income that investment managers collect from their funds, which is typically 20% of profits. Under current tax law, that income is taxed as a capital gain, which has a top tax rate of 20% for long-term gains, versus the highest rate of 37% for regular income, such as the money that workers receive in their paychecks.",
      "\"The carried interest tax loophole is one of the clearest examples of our two-tiered tax system,\" said David Kass, executive director of the tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Average Americans can't cut their tax burden in half for no reason, but the wealthy and well-connected can.\"",
      "Aligned with Democrats",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal to remove the carried interest deduction aligns him with the aims of Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have long sought to eliminate the loophole. Most recently, Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, and 13 other lawmakers on Thursday\u00a0introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act, which would boost the tax rate on investment funds' carried interest to the same rates paid by workers on their income.",
      "Eliminating the Wall Street tax break could help boost tax revenue by about $100 billion over the next decade, according to a new analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), an advocacy group focused on fiscal matters. That would only partly offset the wide-ranging tax cuts Mr. Trump is proposing, which the CRFB estimates will cost almost $5 trillion over the next 10 years.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal is getting pushback from Wall Street, with the trade group American Investment Council urging the new administration to preserve the tax break.",
      "\"We encourage the Trump Administration and Congress to keep this sound tax policy in place and unleash more long-term investment that supports jobs, workers, small businesses, and local communities,\" said Drew Maloney, CEO of the American Investment Council, in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The private equity industry has invested more than $5.6 trillion in the U.S. economy since Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, Maloney noted.",
      "Ending the loophole would put investment managers on the same tax footing as middle-class workers, Kass of the Americans for Tax Fairness said",
      "\"The time for repeal is long overdue,\" Kass said. \"We can't allow loopholes like this to persist as income and wealth inequality continues to intensify.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 16:36:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Proposed 25% U.S. tariffs on Canada and Mexico could lead to a sharp increase in vehicle prices, auto industry executives and analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico could lead to higher domestic vehicle prices and dent profit margins for automakers, according to industry analysts.",
      "The average $25,000 price of a car imported from Mexico or Canada could jump $6,250 if the tariffs take effect, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility. The automotive research firm forecasts that importers would likely pass most of any increase in their costs along to consumers.",
      "What are tariffs? Here's everything you need to know about the import duties.",
      "What are tariffs? Here's everything you need to know about the import duties.",
      "\"The automotive industry is at a critical juncture,\" Michael Robinet, vice president of forecasting at S&P Global Mobility said in a statement. \"The proposed tariffs could not only inflate vehicle prices but also disrupt production schedules, with estimates suggesting a potential 30% decrease in production for high-exposure vehicles once tariffs are enacted, even if only for the short-term.\"",
      "After President Trump on Feb. 1 signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tax on Chinese goods, the White House on Monday suspended those plans for the U.S.' North American neighbors for at least a month to conduct negotiations.",
      "Whether those talks will yield a breakthrough is uncertain. But in response to pressure from Mr. Trump. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have pledged to step up efforts to combat the flow of illicit drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration sees tariffs as a way to exact better terms with U.S. trading partners as well as to leverage other policy gains. In a Feb. 2 post on social media, Mr. Trump acknowledged a new wave of tariffs could cause\u00a0\"some pain\" for Americans, but said his broader vision for the country \"will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "Impact on automakers",
      "While the 25% levies\u00a0on Canada and Mexico have been paused, auto manufacturers are bracing for impact.",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on Wednesday, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said the company is positioned to manage \"a few weeks of tariffs.\" But a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth, he said.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Farley said Ford has enough inventory, including parts, to endure a couple of weeks of tariffs without having to ship car components across the U.S.'s southern and northern borders. Over the long-term, however, the company would have to \"make some major strategy shifts,\" he said, including building new plants in the U.S. to circumvent the taxes.",
      "Mr. Trump has said higher tariffs would spur both U.S. and foreign companies to create more jobs in the U.S. Most economists express skepticism that a higher tariff regime would lead to such a boom, saying most costs would trickle down to American consumers.",
      "General Motors CEO Mary Barra last week also alluded to the effects tariffs could have on its business, saying the company is considering restructuring its supply chain to cushion the blow from tariffs.",
      "\"We're doing the planning and have several levers that we can pull,\" Barra said in an earnings call.",
      "Aptiv, which makes car parts, including vehicle software, hardware and electrical/electronic architecture, has also recently cautioned that potential tariffs could hurt its supply chain.",
      "\"Very intertwined\" economies",
      "Roughly 3.6 million light vehicles were imported into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico in 2024, accounting for 22% of all car sales nationwide, according to S&P Global Mobility. Mexico is the largest source of U.S. light vehicle imports, representing about 15% of sales.",
      "\"The tariffs would really hit the automobile industry hard because the motor vehicle industries of the U.S., Mexico and Canada are very intertwined,\" Marcus Noland, trade policy expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Parts will cross the border seven to eight times before final assembly, and the tariffs are applied every time a part crosses \u2014 so costs would go up very quickly.\"",
      "Manufacturers could reshore some production to the U.S. to avoid the levies, he said, but that would take time and require investing in new manufacturing facilities and labor.",
      "\"The amount of disruption this would cause cannot be overstated,\" Nolan said, adding that the tariffs would also \"tank\" the Mexican economy given how dependent it is on automobile exports to the U.S.",
      "\"If they start going belly up, you'll have unemployed people along the U.S. border, and the ironic thing is one of the reasons for this action was illegal migration, and it could actually incentivize illegal migration. By damaging the Mexican economy, you would probably increase the levels of illegal migration,\" he added.",
      "Reshoring challenges",
      "Automakers are mulling actions to offset possible cost increases, according to manufacturing executives and supply chain experts. But ramping up domestic production presents major challenges, analysts note.",
      "Reshoring production would drive up manufacturing costs due to higher labor expenses, and could contribute to an existing labor shortage, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Duncan Angove, CEO of digital supply-chain company Blue Yonder, told CBS MoneyWatch he expects U.S. automakers to double down on investing in automation and artificial intelligence to cut down on production costs, noting that the tariffs will either reduce companies' profit margins or result in higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Even before, there was a lot of investment pouring into new technology and automation,\" he said. \"But because they realize they can't pass the whole tariff increase along to the consumer, they are making these investments to reduce costs.\"",
      "Meanwhile, if new car prices rise, more U.S. consumers would likely turn to the used car market, which would drive up prices of second-hand vehicles, he added.",
      "\"Bonanza\" for foreign competitors",
      "On Ford's earnings call Wednesday, Farley said U.S. tariffs on Canada and Mexico would not only hurt American automakers, but also benefit foreign competitors not subject to higher import duties, such as Korea's Hyundai and Japan's Honda and Toyota.",
      "\"If we're going to have a tariff policy that lasts for a month or whatever it's going to be, years, it better be comprehensive for our industry,\" Farley said. \"We can't just cherry-pick one place or the other, because this is a bonanza for our import competitors.\"",
      "Tom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told CBS MoneyWatch that prolonged tariffs would result in the U.S. \"hurting American companies and helping Korean and Japanese companies.\"",
      "Meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba in the Oval Office Friday, however, Mr. Trump said tariffs on Japan remain on the table if the U.S.' trade imbalance with Tokyo isn't reduced.",
      "\"We're going to work that out, I think very quickly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't think it will be any problem,\" he said. \"They want fairness also.\"",
      "James Picariello, senior automotive analyst at BNP Paribas Exane, noted that the elimination of discounts and deals stateside could eat into domestic vehicle sales.",
      "\"If automakers have to unwind all discounting and raise prices to sell vehicles, then we are talking about volume declines and major affordability problems for the auto industry,\" added",
      "However, Picariello also thinks the tariffs could bring up to a quarter of their vehicle production back to the U.S. An increase of that size wouldn't require manufacturers to build new plants, he said, given that on average U.S. car makers are currently only producing at about 55% capacity domestically.",
      "\"You can get 1 million units reshored within a reasonable scenario, and the Trump administration can declare a win of some kind. Moving a million units back to the U.S. sounds like a big enough number for the administration to advertise,\" he said.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday that Japan's Nippon Steel will drop its $14.1 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel and instead \"invest heavily\" in the company without taking a majority stake.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the development in a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House.",
      "\"[Nippon's] going to be doing something very exciting about U.S. Steel. They'll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase,\" he said. \"U.S. Steel is a very important company to us. It was the greatest company in the world for 15 years, many years ago, 80 years ago. And we didn't want to see that leave. And it wouldn't actually leave. But the concept, psychologically, not good. So they've agreed to invest heavily in U.S. Steel as opposed to own it, and that sounds very exciting.\"",
      "The president did not reveal details of the proposed investment, and said he and other officials will meet next week with the head of Nippon, which Mr. Trump mistakenly referred to as \"Nissan\" several times. \"They'll work out the details. I'll be there to mediate and arbitrate,\" he said.",
      "People close to the deal were uncertain about whether Mr. Trump wants them to restructure the deal or start again from scratch. And it remains unclear how the president's remarks might affect the proposed acquisition.",
      "Earlier in the day, sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump was considering reversing his disapproval of the merger, which he expressed in a December post on Truth Social: \"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan.\"",
      "During his Oval Office meeting with Ishiba on Friday, CBS News asked the president whether he had changed his mind about the sale. He hinted that he would have news to share afterward and said he thought it would be discussed, saying he hadn't changed his mind. However, he added, \"I hear we'll have some pretty good information on that.\"",
      "Last month, Nippon proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a review panel known as CFIUS. That change was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "The proposed change in the so-called mitigation agreement would give all of the decision-making power on changes to production capacity to the U.S. government.",
      "On Monday, Nippon and U.S. Steel submitted a 70-page opening brief in their case against the U.S. alleging that former President Joe Biden blocked the merger for political reasons and violated their due process. The suit has continued during the Trump administration.",
      "The two companies said in a joint statement announcing the lawsuit last month that they had \"engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the transaction will enhance, not threaten, United States national security.\"",
      "A second lawsuit aimed at domestic rival Cleveland-Cliffs' CEO Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers President David McCall was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the companies stated.",

      "Hiring was weaker than expected by economists, who had forecast that the economy had added 170,000 jobs last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",

      "The unemployment rate had been forecast to remain at 4.1% in January, according to FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "The January employment figures show a slowdown in hiring from December, when employers added 307,000 new jobs. Still, the 143,000 new jobs in January are not far off from the average monthly gain of 166,000 in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",

      "Although the latest data indicates the labor market remains solid \u2014 albeit growing at a slower pace than in December \u2014 it also means borrowing costs for consumers and businesses are likely to stay higher longer.

    "summary": "Here's how big the checks could be, and who is eligible to receive a payment.",
    "story": [
      "Blue Cross Blue Shield payments to about 6 million people are set to go out more than two years after the health insurer reached a $2.67 billion settlement with subscribers.",
      "Notices of payments to claimants are being emailed on a rolling basis, according to\u00a0an update on the BCBS settlement website.",
      "The settlement stems from a class action lawsuit alleging that more than 35 BCBS health insurance plans violated antitrust laws by agreeing not to compete with one another, thereby limiting competition in the health insurance market.",
      "The defendants deny allegations of wrongdoing. \"Instead, Plaintiffs and Settling Defendants have agreed to a Settlement to avoid the risk and cost of further litigation,\" the update on the settlement site reads.",
      "Who gets a check?",
      "Participants must have filed claims by Nov. 5, 2021, to be eligible to receive a payment from the $2.67 billion settlement fund.",
      "Subscribers who were covered by certain Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance or administrative services plans between February 2008 and October 2020 are potential class members.",
      "The site does not indicate when notices of payments will be sent.",
      "How are individual payments determined?",
      "Individual payment amounts are determined based on the number of valid claims that are filed, the premiums paid to one or more of the defendants during one of two class periods, and whether one's insurance was fully insured or self-funded.",
      "\"The Settlement Class Period for Individuals and Insured Groups is from Feb.7, 2008, through Oct. 16, 2020,\" according to the settlement website. \"The Settlement Class Period for Self-Funded Accounts is from Sept. 1, 2015, through Oct. 16, 2020.\"",
      "If the total payment for any claimant is equal to or less than $5\u00a0the claimant won't receive a check.",
      "After deducting attorney's fees and administrative costs, the net settlement fund is worth approximately $1.9 billion, which will be distributed across roughly 6 million claimants. On average, claimants can expect checks of $333.",

    "summary": "Clean energy believes industry's profit potential will sell far better in current climate of nationalism and tycoon leadership.",
    "story": [
      "Saving the planet is so 2024. Clean energy leaders across the globe are now tailoring their messages to emphasize the greener side of green: wealth-building. It's an idea that sells far better in the new world of nationalism and tycoon leaders.",
      "Messaging from the U.S. renewable energy industry and the United Nations on climate change has typically focused on the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions for the sake of environmental and human health. To bolster the argument, they cite record-shattering heat around the world, the frequent climate disasters costing billions of dollars and the human toll of it all.",
      "But a sharper emphasis on profit potential has become evident as President Donald Trump stormed into office with a flurry of rollbacks to clean energy initiatives and an emphatic declaration of plans to \"unleash\" oil, gas and mining. In a lobbying blitz in Washington this week, solar, wind, hydropower and other clean-energy interests touted their role in a \"robust American energy and manufacturing economy\" and sported lapel pins that said \"American energy dominance\" \u2014 a favorite Trump phrase.",
      "U.K. firm cracks the code to convert harmful methane emissions into useful hydrogen and graphene",
      "U.K. firm cracks the code to convert harmful methane emissions into useful hydrogen and graphene",
      "Meanwhile, in a major policy speech Thursday in Brazil, the U.N.'s top climate official played up the $2 trillion flowing into clean-energy projects and recalled a friend telling him that appealing to people's \"better angels\" only goes so far.",
      "That friend, according to U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, added: \"In the great horserace of life ... 'always back self-interest ... what's in it for me.' \"",
      "It's not that clean energy backers haven't made the case before. But a different landscape, especially in the U.S., stands to make it more potent.",
      "\"It's a very winning message for outreach to conservatives because it's really true,\" said former U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who founded the conservative climate group RepublicEN.org. \"If we play your cards right and lead the world to this, we can create a lot of wealth, create a lot of jobs here in America.\"",
      "Inglis pointed to Elon Musk's empire-building on electric cars, solar panels and batteries.",
      "\"When right-of-center people hear, 'you know, you can you make a profit at this' then it makes sense. Otherwise, it's like, why are people giving stuff away?\" Inglis said.",
      "Jobs especially have long been a big selling point for solar and wind energy and electric cars, but there's a push to not think of self-interest as a dirty word \u2014 and instead to harness it, United Nations officials said. When Stiell mentioned the $2 trillion in his speech for clean energy, he called it \"unstoppable because of the colossal scale of economic opportunity it presents.\"",
      "Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who is also a professor of international affairs, said climate change is such a difficult problem, \"if some people feel the need to cater to narrower self-interests which can be bundled into a solution to the problem, why not?\"",
      "In letters and at more than 100 congressional meetings this week, industry leaders from the Solar Energy Industries Association, Oceantic Network and other organizations appealed to keep crucial tax incentives in place so their projects can be globally competitive.",
      "The appeal targets lawmakers who might dismiss climate change but be open to an economic rationale, said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which spearheaded a letter.",
      "\"In the past administration, obviously, we emphasized the common interest around climate mitigation,\" Stolark said. \"The messaging with this current administration and with the Republicans is shifting more to that energy piece, the economic piece, the jobs piece.",
      "\"I think you want to meet an audience where they are, what's important to them, what's going to drive the conversation forward.\"",
      "Liz Beardsley, senior policy counsel at the U.S. Green Building Council that was part of the sweeping lobbying effort, said the economy has always been a core component of its messages, and that \"doing good is also good for business.\"",
      "To Lisa Sachs, director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, messaging that climate efforts were strictly for the planet was actually disingenuous.",
      "\"The honesty and coherence of the business and financial sectors in making the economic case for the transition is refreshing, at least, after years of doublespeak, greenwashing and confusion,\" Sachs said. \"It's not a perfect strategy from a climate or social perspective, as the private sector cannot on its own fully decarbonize the economy ... But under this administration, it's probably our best bet for progress.\"",
      "President Trump may not be reachable, but his Energy and Interior secretaries are and they have power, said Frank Maisano, a longtime Washington spokesman for energy interests from oil and gas to wind and batteries.",
      "It's time for a change, said Joanna Depledge, a climate historian at Cambridge University in England: \"Banging on about the catastrophic climate crisis is obviously doing no good at all.\"",

    "story": [
      "About 500,000 ranges sold nationwide are being recalled after dozens of fires burned property, people and pets, LG Electronics said Wednesday in a notice posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The recall involves ranges with front-mounted knobs that can be turned accidentally, with CPSC receiving at least 86 reports of unintentional activation. The recalled ranges have been involved in more than 28 fires, with at least five causing extensive property damage totaling more than $340,000. At least eight minor injuries have been reported, including burns, and at least three of the fires involved the deaths of pets, according to the federal agency.",
      "Found at appliance stores including Best Buy, Costco, The Home Depot, Lowe's, and online at LG.com, the recalled ranges were sold from 2015 through January 2025 for between $1,400 and $2,650, depending on the model. Manufactured in Mexico and Korea by LG Electronics Inc. of Korea, the ranges were imported by the company's U.S. subsidiary, based in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.",
      "Model and serial numbers involved in the recall can be found here.",
      "Owners of the recalled ranges should contact LG for a free warning label and placement instructions. The label reminds consumers to use the lock out/control lock function on the range panel to disable activation of the heating elements when not in use.",
      "\"Keep children and pets away\"",
      "\"Consumers are cautioned to keep children and pets away from the knobs, to check the range knobs to ensure they are off before leaving home or going to bed, and not to leave objects on the range when the range is not in use,\" the recall notice stated.",

      "The issue seemingly extends beyond one brand, as evidenced by Samsung's summertime recall of more than 1.1 million ranges sold nationwide after about 250 fires injured dozens and killed at least seven pets.",
      "According to the agency, CPSC was \"aware of incidents where houses burned, and people died from house fires started by range knobs accidentally turned on whether from people bumping into the knobs or pets activating the range. The issues affect both gas and electric ranges,\" the federal agency stated in a\u00a0summary\u00a0of a June 27 working group meeting.",
      "Between 2018 and May 30, 2024, CPSC data shows there were 338 incidents involving a range or cooktop accidentally being activated, involving 10 manufacturers. Two of those incidents led to fatalities, while 31 resulted in nonfatal injuries, according to the agency.",

      "\"I'm a middle-class school teacher who's now in a dream world,\" Fogel said.",
      "The White House has declined to provide details about what the U.S. was giving up in the deal with Russia, and Mr. Trump also refused to say how it was reached, only calling the terms \"very fair, very reasonable.\" The president also teased that \"somebody else is being released tomorrow that you will know of.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wouldn't disclose if he spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of Fogel's release.",
      "Waltz had earlier said that Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, was leaving Russian airspace with Fogel, who was serving a 14-year sentence and was\u00a0designated as \"wrongfully detained\"\u00a0by the U.S. late last year.",
      "\"President Trump, Steve Witkoff and the president's advisors negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,\" he said in a statement. \"Since President Trump's swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States.\"",

      "His family had pushed for Mr. Trump's predecessor, former President Joe Biden, to secure his release, particularly after Fogel was left out of prisoner swaps negotiated by the previous administration. In December 2022, Russia released WNBA star Brittney Griner in a one-for-one prisoner swap for international arms dealer Viktor Bout.",
      "Then, last August, the Biden administration secured the release of three more Americans from Russia \u2014 Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich, Marine veteran\u00a0Paul Whelan\u00a0and Russian-American radio journalist\u00a0Alsu Kurmasheva\u00a0\u2014 as part of a 24-person prisoner exchange.",

      "\"We are beyond grateful, relieved, and overwhelmed that after more than three years of detention, our father, husband, and son, Marc Fogel, is finally coming home,\" they said. \"Thanks to the unwavering leadership of President Trump, Marc will soon be back on American soil, free where he belongs. This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.\"",
      "Martin De Luca and Andrew Smith, Fogel's legal team, also praised the president and his administration for their work in freeing him.",
      "\"Marc Fogel's release is historic, long overdue, and a testament to the power of strong leadership,\" they said. \"After years of bureaucratic inaction including consistent refusals to designate Marc as wrongfully detained, President Trump secured Marc's release in just a few weeks, wasting no time in taking decisive action to bring Marc home.\"",
      "Pennsylvania's senators, John Fetterman and Dave McCormick, cheered Fogel's release.",
      "\"Marc Fogel's return home is long overdue \u2014 and I know all of Pennsylvania, especially his family, will be welcoming him back with open arms,\" Fetterman, a Democrat,\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "\"I am thrilled that Marc Fogel is finally coming home after years of being wrongfully held in Russia,\" McCormick, a Republican, said in a post. \"I have been working with the administration on this since day one and I'm grateful to President Trump and Secretary Rubio for delivering on their commitment to free Marc. As I told Marc's Mom, Mafa, when we spoke in August, we had to do everything possible to get Marc home and it is a blessing that this day has finally come.\"",

      "The rapid downsizing and freezing of government programs, which Democrats call illegal, has run into widespread legal opposition in the courts, with dozens of lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of Musk and his team dismantling agencies and programs established by Congress.

      "Jordan is home to more than 2 million Palestinians and, along with other Arab states, has flatly rejected Mr. Trump's plan to relocate civilians from Gaza. Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said last week that his country's opposition to Mr. Trump's idea was \"firm and unwavering.\"",
      "Besides concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily.",
      "The king is also meeting with top Trump administration officials during his visit, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He is the third foreign leader to hold an in-person meeting with Mr. Trump since his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The president announced his ideas for resettling Palestinians from Gaza and taking ownership of the territory for the U.S. during a press conference last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He initially didn't rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure Gaza but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of the territory, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan.",
      "After Mr. Trump's initial comments, Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza \"temporarily\" and sought an \"interim\" period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordnance and reconstruction.",
      "But asked in an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier that aired Monday if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory under his plan, he replied, \"No, they wouldn't.\"",

      "U.S. Secret Service Deputy Director Ronald Rowe, who formerly served as acting director of the agency, announced Tuesday he's retiring.",
      "Rowe was named to the top position in an acting capacity after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in July, under pressure from lawmakers who called for her to step down in the wake of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.",
      "Rowe led the agency until Sean Curran was appointed director last month.",
      "\"Deputy Director Ronald Rowe, a valued executive and leader of the United States Secret Service, has announced his decision to retire after 26 years of dedicated service,\" U.S. Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told CBS News in a statement. \"He is currently enjoying a well-deserved break before his retirement.\"",
      "As acting director, Rowe testified multiple times before lawmakers, addressing questions about the security failures that allowed the gunman in Butler, Thomas Matthew Crooks, to gain access to a rooftop so close to where President Trump was speaking. His most recent appearance before the bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempt, last December, devolved into a shouting match when Republican Rep. Pat Fallon accused him of \"playing politics\" when he attended a 9/11 memorial event with the nation's top leaders.",
      "Rowe first joined the agency in 1999, serving in Secret Service field offices in West Palm Beach and Miami before joining the Presidential Protective Division, and later, the agency's Congressional Affairs Program. He has also served as chief of staff and assistant director for the Office of Intergovernmental and Legislative Affairs.",
      "Last week, in a message to the workforce obtained by CBS News, Curran acknowledged Rowe's service and expressed his gratitude for his \"exceptional leadership stepping into the role of Acting Director during a pivotal time in our agency.\"",
      "\"Mr. Rowe navigated the past six months with grace, resilience, and a profound sense of responsibility,\" Curran wrote, adding, \"Through every role, Mr. Rowe focused on the success of our mission and our people.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate advanced Gabbard's nomination in a party-line procedural vote Monday night, teeing up a vote on final passage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate is expected to vote Wednesday on Tulsi Gabbard's confirmation for director of national intelligence, after her nomination survived a crucial committee vote last week and cleared a key procedural hurdle Monday.",
      "Gabbard, 43, is a former Democratic congresswoman who represented Hawaii in the House from 2013 to 2021, and sought the party's nomination for president in the 2020 election. In 2022, she opted to leave the party, and she endorsed President Trump's 2024 White House bid.",
      "Gabbard was previously seen as one of the most unlikely of Mr. Trump's picks to get through the Senate. Though she served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, Gabbard doesn't have a background in intelligence. And she faced scrutiny for meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017, as well as her comments about Russia's war in Ukraine, her previous opposition to renewing a key government surveillance authority and a push to pardon National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.",
      "During her hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee last month, Gabbard was grilled by both Democrats and Republicans on many of the actions and positions that have sparked controversy, with the most contentious moments of the hearing surrounding whether she would characterize Snowden as a \"traitor.\" Gabbard declined to say so.",
      "But as the committee prepared to hold a vote on whether to advance Gabbard's nomination last week, possible GOP opposition fell by the wayside. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Todd Young of Indiana both pledged to back Gabbard, and her nomination eked through with a 9-8 vote along party lines to recommend her confirmation.",
      "The full Senate went on to advance Gabbard's nomination 52-46 in a party-line procedural vote Monday night, though Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania did not vote. The vote started the clock on up to 30 hours of debate before a vote on final passage, setting up a vote on final passage in the wee hours of the morning Wednesday that was pushed back until later Wednesday amid snowy conditions in Washington.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune praised Gabbard ahead of the procedural vote Monday, calling her \"a patriot\" who is \"motivated by service.\"",
      "\"The intelligence community needs to refocus on its core mission \u2014 collecting intelligence and providing unbiased analysis of that information,\" Thune said. \"That's what Tulsi Gabbard is committed to ensuring if she is confirmed to be DNI. And I believe she has the knowledge and leadership capabilities to get it done.\"",
      "At her confirmation hearing, Gabbard defended her qualifications, citing her experience as a battalion commander and service on the Homeland Security, Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees in Congress. That experience, she said, has \"given me a deep understanding of the complex challenges that our nation faces.\"",
      "\"In both roles engaging with world leaders, in both roles being privy to highly classified intelligence,\" Gabbard said. \"So I know first hand how essential accurate, unbiased and timely intelligence is to the president, to Congress and to our warfighters. I also know the heavy cost of intelligence failures and abuses.\"",
      "Gabbard argued that \"for too long, faulty, inadequate or weaponized intelligence have led to costly failures, and the undermining of our national security and god-given freedoms enshrined in the Constitution,\" adding that Mr. Trump's victory in the 2024 election is \"a clear mandate from the American people to break this cycle of failure.\"",
      "\"If confirmed as DNI, I will do my very best to fulfill this mandate, and bring leadership to the intelligence community with a laser-like focus on our essential mission \u2014 ensuring the safety, security and freedom of the American people,\" Gabbard said.",

      "Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin said he has \"highly credible information\" that Patel is behind the firings at the bureau, though he is not yet the FBI director. Patel denied any knowledge of them when he testified before the committee.",
      "In a letter to Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, Durbin wrote that even though Patel has not yet been confirmed as director, \"multiple sources\" said Patel has been personally directing the purge at the FBI.",
      "\"It is unacceptable for a nominee with no current role in government, much less at the FBI, to personally direct unjustified and potentially illegal adverse employment actions against senior career FBI leadership and other dedicated, nonpartisan law enforcement officers,\" Durbin wrote.",
      "Durbin told the Justice Department IG that he had heard from his sources that Patel's directives were being carried out by top White House aide Stephen Miller, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove and members of the new FBI Director's Advisory Team. A member of the team, Durbin said his sources told him, has been providing Patel with information about what's going on inside the bureau, and that Patel \"then provides direction to Mr. Miller, who relays it to Acting Deputy Attorney General Bove.\" He claimed that each person on the DAT team communicated to bureau officials that \"at some point before January 30 that they had been in direct contact with Mr. Patel.\"",
      "DAT, Durbin said, had a list that \"identified certain officials and was seen by multiple FBI leaders.\" Those on the list were understood to be \"people in the crosshairs.\" On Jan. 29, Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll and Acting FBI Deputy Director Robert Kissane held a meeting \"where it was relayed that a group of Executive Assistant Directors (EAD) and other supervisors must resign or be fired,\" Durbin wrote.",
      "Durbin quoted \"[c]ontemporaneous notes\" from a meeting between Justice Department and FBI leadership earlier that day that said, \"KP wants movement at FBI, reciprocal actions for DOJ.\" Durbin said that Bove told people at the meeting he had \"received multiple calls\" from Miller, who was \"pressuring him\" because \"Mr. Patel wanted the FBI to remove targeted employees faster, as DOJ had already done with prosecutors.\"",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "Patel was nominated to replace Christopher Wray, who was himself a Trump appointee during the president's first term. But Mr. Trump soured on Wray during the FBI's investigation of the attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Wray resigned on Jan. 20.",
      "Durbin said that if the allegations about Patel's involvement in the FBI firings are true, \"Mr. Patel may have perjured himself before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\"",
      "During his confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, Patel said he was \"not aware\" of ongoing plans to punish or fire FBI agents and personnel who had worked on the multiple investigations into Mr.\u00a0 Trump, adding, \"I don't know what's going on right now over there.\"",
      "Patel's confirmation process has already been filled with controversy and delays.",
      "In January, an FBI insider came forward questioning Patel's judgment during a hostage rescue mission when he worked with the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which leads the government's missions to rescue hostages overseas.",
      "Democrats also pressed Patel during his confirmation hearing about his promotion of the \"J6 Prison Choir,\" a list of \"deep state\" executive branch officials listed in his book, \"Government Gangsters,\" and his refusal to acknowledge Mr. Trump had lost the 2020 election.",
      "Also on Tuesday, 30 lawmakers wrote a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley and Durbin asking the committee to oppose advancing Patel's nomination because of \"inconsistencies\" in his testimony and his \"history of inflammatory statements.\"",
      "Grassley said in a post on X, \"Another day another attack against Kash Patel by the Democrats.\" He called the latest allegations \"nothing more than hearsay,\" and he praised Patel's \"character+ credibility which over half a million law enforcement officers hv vouched for.\"",

    "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson said House GOP expects to move forward on budget plan this week that lays foundation for approving Trump's agenda.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that House Republicans expect to move forward on a budget plan later this week that lays a foundation for approving President Trump's agenda, though a budget resolution has yet to be released.",
      "\"We'll be rolling out the details of that probably by tonight,\" Johnson said at a news conference Tuesday, adding that \"we are right on the schedule that we need to be on.\"",
      "Leaders in Congress have been pursuing a massive legislative package under the budget reconciliation process that would enact Mr. Trump's agenda, including resources to bolster border security, extend some of the 2017 tax cuts, incentivize domestic manufacturing and invest in American energy, while working to trim government programs and address the debt limit. But the process has faced delays amid intraparty disagreement on how to proceed. And the stalled progress in the House has prompted the Senate to move ahead with its own proposal in recent days.",
      "House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington indicated in the House Republican conference meeting earlier Tuesday that a markup of the budget resolution would be scheduled for Thursday, Johnson said.",
      "Meanwhile, the Senate Budget Committee is scheduled to mark up its budget resolution Wednesday and Thursday. The committee's chairman, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, unveiled the resolution last week.",
      "The Senate version includes border security, defense and energy priorities, leaving the tax components for a later date. Senate Republicans have generally advocated a two-bill approach, citing the complicated nature of the tax components, while House Republicans have backed a one-bill strategy to get the priorities through their divided conference.",
      "Though the Senate had for weeks deferred to the House to kickstart the reconciliation process, frustrations came to a head among Senate Republicans last week, culminating in Graham's announcement that they would proceed with their own plan.",
      "Still, Johnson has repeatedly urged the Senate to let the House lead, saying Sunday that \"at the end of the day, the House has to drive this process \u2014 and we will.\"",
      "\"I appreciate the Senate's zeal, we have it in the House as well,\" Johnson said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"But as I reminded my friend Lindsey, I have about 170 additional personalities to deal with and he's only got 53.\"",
      "Johnson, with a razor-thin GOP majority in the lower chamber, said he's made clear to Mr. Trump and his team that a one-bill strategy is essential, giving House Republicans the best chance to deliver on Mr. Trump's campaign promises. That's in part because of the difficulties posed by trying to pass two major bills under the budget reconciliation process.",
      "Using this approach, lawmakers can bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate in favor of a simple majority, which makes it easier to pass a bill in the upper chamber. But the final product can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit. And any new spending must be paid for, while the Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package to confirm that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences.",
      "The approval of a budget resolution marks the first key hurdle in the process. House Republicans had initially planned to hold a markup of the budget resolution last week, outlining a timeline to have the package on Mr. Trump's desk before May, but pushback from budget hawks for deeper spending cuts in recent weeks has slowed the process.",
      "The House Freedom Caucus, which has also advocated for a two-bill approach, released its own budget resolution Monday, which would allocate $200 billion for border security and defense, paired with $486 billion in spending cuts, and a proposed debt ceiling increase by $4 trillion.",
      "Graham told reporters at a news conference Tuesday afternoon that he spoke with Johnson at the Super Bowl and stressed that \"nothing would please me more than one big beautiful bill passed by the House that did all the things we need to do to make us prosperous and safe.\" But he said the Senate is moving forward because \"we're running out of money.\"",
      "The South Carolina Republican outlined that border czar Tom Homan and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought addressed the Senate GOP conference Tuesday and begged congressional Republicans to approve money for border security.",
      "Graham said to his GOP House colleagues, \"I wish you the best, I want one big beautiful bill, but I cannot and will not go back to South Carolina and justify not supporting the president's immigration plan. We're not building a wall, folks, we're hitting a wall. They need the money and they need it now.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week that El Salvador's president offered to incarcerate deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including U.S. citizens, but the deal came the same day as a less-publicized offer from the United States: nuclear power.",
      "El Salvador's Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill Tinoco said a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the U.S. would help power the central American country \"at competitive pricing without depending on geopolitics or on oil prices.\"",
      "\"The experience that [the United States has] on civil nuclear energy will give us all of the tools we need to train our people, to train our Salvadoran experts, who will lead the technical and regulatory aspects of this transition \u2014 this unprecedented transition,\" Hill Tonoco said.",
      "Rubio hailed the nuclear cooperation agreement just before announcing that El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, also agreed to take deportees and incarcerated Americans from the U.S. and \"put them in his jails.\"",
      "Bukele said he would charge the United States a \"relatively low\" fee to house convicted criminals in El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a mega-prison built to hold up to 40,000 people. He said the nominal cost for America would help make \u00a0El Salvador's prison system sustainable.",
      "The nuclear agreement is a potential national security win for the United States, according to Edward Kee, who in 2022 was appointed to the Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee.",
      "\"A nuclear power plant is a hundred-year deal. If a country in Central America signed up for a Russian or Chinese reactor, this would not be good for U.S. national security in the region,\" said Kee, who founded the Washington-based Nuclear Economics Consulting Group. \"This is especially a concern because these Russian and Chinese nuclear power deals usually include broader government-to-government arrangements.\"",
      "The United States is the largest producer of nuclear energy, accounting for about 30% of the worldwide total, according to the World Nuclear Association.",
      "Proponents say nuclear energy is one the most environmentally friendly, reliable existing energy resources, but critics view it as dangerous, wasteful and expensive.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright has promised to prioritize the production of nuclear power and liquefied natural gas under the Trump administration. Investors cheered and stocks jumped when Wright, a fossil fuel company executive, was nominated.",
      "Partner countries must sign what's known as a 123 Agreement with the United States before the U.S. licenses significant exports of U.S.-origin nuclear material and equipment. At their core, the agreements are intended to advance shared nuclear nonproliferation and security objectives between the United States and its partners, the State Department said in its information page outlining these agreements.",
      "The U.S. had 25 such agreements as of Feb. 3, including with the United Kingdom, Singapore, Norway and others. El Salvador would be the first and only country from Central America in that group.",
      "El Salvador is pursuing nuclear power \u2014 signing a similar agreement with Argentina in October \u2014 at a time when the barriers that have prevented smaller countries from developing it may be receding, according to Alfonso Blanco, the former executive director of the intergovernmental Latin American Energy Organization.",
      "\"There is a significant opportunity for the revival of nuclear energy through small-scale reactors, and the technology requires demonstration sites in countries that lack developed nuclear capacities,\" said Blanco, who now works for The Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. \"This could represent a potential development path for El Salvador.\"",
      "Blanco said El Salvador and most other countries have limited options for procuring the necessary fuel for nuclear power because only eight countries have the technical capacity to enrich uranium.",
      "\"For El Salvador, positioning itself as a regional pioneer in the use of a new nuclear technology could present an interesting opportunity, especially considering that such infrastructure projects have significant spillover effects on job creation and local capacity development,\" Blanco said.",
      "But while the country's mega-prison is already built and ready to house tens of thousands of people, its nuclear plans are in their infancy.",
      "That means El Salvador is unlikely to close in on nuclear power while President Trump is in office, according to Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.",

    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 President Trump's U.S. \"border czar\" Tom Homan lashed out Tuesday at Pope Francis after the leader of the Catholic Church strongly criticized the mass deportation of migrants that Mr. Trump has initiated in his second term.",
      "In an open letter to U.S. Catholic bishops sent Tuesday, the Argentinian pope criticized Mr. Trump's mass deportation program, saying those who entered the United States illegally should not be treated as criminals and that the overall plan could not be supported as it violates human dignity.",
      "When asked Tuesday by a Fox News reporter to comment on the pope's \"harsh words,\" Homan replied: \"I've got harsh words for the pope: I say this as a lifelong Catholic. He ought to focus on his work and leave enforcement to us. He's got a wall around the Vatican, does he not?\"",
      "Homan reiterated that sentiment to other reporters at the White House, saying: \"I wish he'd stick to the Catholic Church and fix that and leave border enforcement to us.\"",
      "In his letter to the bishops, Francis said he was closely following the \"major crisis\" in the U.S., but that the \"rightly formed conscience cannot fail to make a critical judgment and express its disagreement with any measure that tacitly or explicitly identifies the illegal status of some migrants with criminality.\"",
      "Fury in India over U.S. deportees seen leg-chained for long flight",
      "Fury in India over U.S. deportees seen leg-chained for long flight",
      "Francis acknowledged that nations have the right to defend themselves against migrants who have committed crimes, but he said that was not incompatible with policies for orderly and legal migration.",
      "Deporting people who fled extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious environmental deterioration in their home nations, regardless of how they enter the U.S., \"damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness,\" the pope said.",
      "\"What is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly,\" Francis warned.",
      "The pope, 88, has made the defense of migrants and refugees a priority of his papacy since he was elected to lead the Catholic Church in 2013.\u00a0 Still, it is rare for a pontiff to so directly critique a country's internal political debate.",
      "The pope also rejected Vice President JD Vance's use of Catholic theology to justify the immigration crackdown.",
      "In a January 29 appearance on Fox News, Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, described what he said was \"a very Christian concept: You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country. And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.\"",
      "When critics responded that he had misunderstood the gospel, Vance took to social media to argue that a person's moral duties to their own children outweigh those, \"to a stranger who lives thousands of miles away.\"",
      "\"Just google 'ordo amoris,' Vance wrote, referring to a medieval Catholic concept on the \"order of love\" or \"order of charity\" to God, ourselves and our neighbors.",
      "While not mentioning Vance directly, Pope Francis directly contradicted the vice president's interpretation of Christian love in his Tuesday letter.",
      "\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,\" he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 13:30:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The lawsuit from more than two dozen Christian and Jewish groups contends that the new policy is spreading fear of raids, thus lowering attendance at worship services.",
    "story": [
      "More than two-dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans \u2014 ranging from the Episcopal Church and the Union for Reform Judaism to the Mennonites and Unitarian Universalists \u2014 filed a\u00a0federal court lawsuit\u00a0Tuesday challenging a Trump administration move giving immigration agents more leeway to make arrests at houses of worship.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, contends that the new policy is spreading fear of raids, thus lowering attendance at worship services and other valuable church programs. The result, says the suit, infringes on the groups' religious freedom \u2014 namely their ability to minister to migrants, including those in the United States illegally.",
      "\"We have immigrants, refugees, people who are documented and undocumented,\" said the Most Rev. Sean Rowe, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.",
      "\"We cannot worship freely if some of us are living in fear,\" he told The Associated Press. \"By joining this lawsuit, we're seeking the ability to gather and fully practice our faith, to follow Jesus' command to love our neighbors as ourselves.\"",
      "The new lawsuit echoes and expands on some of the arguments made in a similar lawsuit filed Jan. 27 by five Quaker congregations and later joined by the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and a Sikh temple. It is currently pending in U.S. District Court in Maryland.",
      "There was no immediate Trump administration response to the new lawsuit, which names the Department of Homeland Security and its immigration enforcement agencies as defendants. However, a memorandum filed Friday by the Department of Justice, opposing the thrust of the Quaker lawsuit, outlined arguments that may also apply to the new lawsuit.",
      "In essence, the memo contended that the plaintiffs' request to block the new enforcement policy is based on speculation of hypothetical future harm \u2014 and thus is insufficient grounds for issuing an injunction.",
      "The memo said that immigration enforcement affecting houses of worship had been permitted for decades, and the new policy announced in January simply said that field agents \u2014 using \"common sense\" and \"discretion\" \u2014 could now conduct such operations without pre-approval from a supervisor.",
      "One part of that memo might not apply to the new lawsuit, as it argued the Quakers and their fellow plaintiffs have no basis for seeking a nationwide injunction against the revised enforcement policy.",
      "\"Any relief in this case should be tailored solely to the named plaintiffs,\" said the DOJ memo, contending that any injunction should not apply to other religious organizations.",
      "Who are the plaintiffs in the lawsuit?",
      "The plaintiffs in the new lawsuit represent a vastly larger swath of American worshippers \u2014 including more than 1 million followers of Reform Judaism, the estimated 1.5 million Episcopalians in 6,700 congregations nationwide, nearly 1.1 million members of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and the estimated 1.5 million active members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church \u2014 the country's oldest predominantly Black denomination.",
      "Among the other plaintiffs are the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), with more than 3,000 congregations; the Church of the Brethren, with more than 780 congregations; the Convenci\u00f3n Bautista Hispana de Texas, encompassing about 1,100 Hispanic Baptist churches; the Friends General Conference, an association of regional Quaker organizations; the Mennonite Church USA, with about 50,000 members; the Unitarian Universalist Association, with more than 1,000 congregations; the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, with more than 500 U.S. congregations; and regional branches of the United Methodist Church and the United Church of Christ.",
      "\"The massive scale of the suit will be hard for them to ignore,\" said Kelsi Corkran, a lawyer with the Georgetown University Law Center's\u00a0Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection\u00a0who is lead counsel for the lawsuit.",
      "The plaintiffs joined the suit, she said, \"because their scripture, teaching, and traditions offer irrefutable unanimity on their religious obligation to embrace and serve the refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants in their midst without regard to documentation or legal status.\"",
      "Prior to the recent Trump administration change, Corkran said immigration agents generally needed a judicial warrant or other special authorization to conduct operations at houses of worship and other \"sensitive locations\" such as schools and hospitals.",
      "\"Now it's go anywhere, any time,\" she told the AP. \"Now they have broad authority to swoop in \u2014 they've made it very clear they'll get every undocumented person.\"",
      "She cited a recent incident in which a Honduran man was arrested outside his family's Atlanta-area church while a service was being held inside.",
      "The lawsuit includes details from some of the plaintiffs as to how their operations might be affected. The Union for Reform Judaism and the Mennonites, among others, said many of their synagogues and churches host on-site foodbanks, meal programs, homeless shelters and other support services for undocumented people who might now be fearful of participating.",
      "One of the plaintiffs is the Latino Christian National Network, which seeks to bring together Latino leaders with different traditions and values to collaborate on pressing social issues. The network's president is the Rev. Carlos Malav\u00e9, a pastor of two churches in Virginia, who described to the AP what network members are observing.",
      "\"There is deep-seated fear and distrust of our government,\" he said. \"People fear going to the store, they are avoiding going to church. ... The churches are increasingly doing online services because people fear for the well-being of their families.\"",
      "The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which leads the nation's largest denomination, did not join the lawsuit, though it has criticized Mr. Trump's migration crackdown. On Tuesday, Pope Francis issued a major rebuke of the deportation plan, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity and \"will end badly.\"",
      "Many conservative faith leaders and legal experts across the U.S. do not share concerns about the new arrest policy.",
      "\"Places of worship are for worship and are not sanctuaries for illegal activity or for harboring people engaged in illegal activity,\" said Mat Staver, founder of the conservative Christian legal organization Liberty Counsel.",
      "\"Fugitives or criminals are not immune from the law merely because they enter a place of worship,\" he said via email. \"This is not a matter of religious freedom. There is no right to openly violate the law and disobey law enforcement.\"",
      "Professor Cathleen Kaveny, who teaches in the theology department and law school at Boston College, questioned whether the plaintiffs would prevail with the religious freedom argument, but suggested the administration might be unwise to disregard a traditional view of houses of worship as places of sanctuary for vulnerable people.",
      "\"These buildings are different \u2014 almost like embassies,\" she said. \"I think of churches as belonging to an eternal country.\"",

    "summary": "The NGO Doctors for America argued that HHS, CDC and FDA violated federal law in removing medical information from public-facing websites.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration to restore webpages and data that had been scrubbed in compliance with President Trump's executive order on gender ideology\u00a0while litigation moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates agreed to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the group Doctors for America, which argued that its members used the websites when treating patients and conducting research. The nonprofit organization said that the removal of the webpages by the Department of Health and Human Services and its components violated federal law.",
      "Bates found that the challengers were likely to succeed in their claims that the Department Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA acted unlawfully when they stripped medical information from public-facing websites.",
      "\"It bears emphasizing who ultimately bears the harm of defendants' actions: everyday Americans, and most acutely, underprivileged Americans, seeking healthcare,\" he wrote. Citing declarations from two doctors filed in the case, Bates said if they \"cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health.\"",
      "His order directs the agencies to restore earlier versions of their websites by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. It comes after Bates held a hearing on the matter Monday.",
      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

    "summary": "South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace is raising allegations against a former fianc\u00e9 and his business associates.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, in a nearly hour-long speech on the U.S. House floor Monday, accused her ex-fianc\u00e9 of physically abusing her, recording sex acts with her and others without their consent, and conspiring with business associates in acts of rape and sexual misconduct.",
      "Mace said she was speaking out because her home state's top prosecutor didn't take action even after she alerted investigators. That same prosecutor is likely to be Mace's opponent if she runs for governor of South Carolina in 2026, which she has said she's considering.",
      "Saying she was going \"scorched earth,\" Mace detailed how, in November 2023, she says she \"accidentally uncovered some of the most heinous crimes against women imaginable.\"",
      "\"We're talking about rape, non-consensual photos, non-consensual videos of women and underage girls, and the premeditated, calculated exploitation of women and girls in my district,\" Mace said.",
      "Mace mentioned four men as being involved, including Charleston-area businessman Patrick Bryant, who was her fianc\u00e9 until 2023 and campaigned door-to-door for her during her 2022 reelection campaign.",
      "The AP wasn't able to independently verify Mace's claims. Bryant told the AP, \"I categorically deny these allegations. I take this matter seriously and will cooperate fully with any necessary legal processes to clear my name.\"",
      "Mace accused South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson of slow-walking any investigation of Bryant and the other men after she had brought the photos and video to state authorities.",
      "\"Did South Carolina's attorney general have any of these predators indicted after being provided clear cut-and-dry evidence including video, photos and witnesses?\" Mace asked, noting that her office had stood up a tip line for anyone with information on the allegations.",
      "In a statement after Mace's speech, Wilson's office called her comments regarding the prosecutor's conduct \"categorically false\" and said the office \"has not received any reports or requests for assistance from any law enforcement or prosecution agencies regarding these matters.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Democratic House Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California said he did not see Mace's floor speech but had read a report about it. He said she raised \"very serious allegations,\" and added, \"I would hope that law enforcement will take a look if there is something there, but I'm not minimizing the importance of what she said, or the allegations that she's that she's made or the protected manner in which she's doing it from the House floor.\"",
      "Mace, a former South Carolina state House member, was the first woman to graduate from The Citadel, the state's military college, where her father then served as commandant of cadets. Briefly serving in the state House, in 2020 she became the first Republican woman elected to represent South Carolina in Congress, flipping the 1st District after a single term with a Democratic representative.",
      "Her decision to air the allegations in a floor speech was unusual. In a release, Mace stressed that members' statements on the House floor \"are quintessential 'legislative acts'\" and thereby protected by the \"speech or debate\" clause, which generally protects lawmakers from being sued for what they say.",
      "\"This isn't a story about bitter ex-girlfriends or consensual sex tapes \u2014 there are plenty of those. I don't care what two consenting adults agree to do,\" Mace said. She mentioned a dozen bills on which she had worked in the House, on topics ranging from stopping voyeurism to banning transgender women from using women's bathrooms at the U.S. Capitol or House office buildings.",
      "In 2019, Mace spoke publicly for the first time about a sexual assault she said had occurred more than two decades earlier, addressing South Carolina legislative colleagues in advocating for adding a rape and incest exception to a state House ban on all abortions after detection of a fetal heartbeat.",
      "On Monday, Mace said she was joined in the House gallery by several women she said had been victimized by Bryant and the other men. Among the Republican lawmakers who sat behind Mace during her speech to show their support were Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "\"Nancy Mace is our friend and we wanted to support her and give her the encouragement she needed to get that message out,\" Boebert said.",
      "Mace, 47, won a third U.S. House term in November and has said that she is \"seriously considering\" a 2026 run for South Carolina governor. If she enters that race, she will likely face Wilson \u2014 in his fourth term and also the son of Rep. Joe Wilson \u2014 in the GOP primary.",
      "Mace has largely supported President Trump, working for his 2016 campaign but levying criticism against him following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, critique that spurred Trump to back a GOP challenger in her 2022 race. Mace defeated that opponent, won reelection and was endorsed by Trump in her 2024 campaign.",
      "Mace declined additional comment to reporters in the Capitol after the speech. Asked how she felt now, she said, \"I'm at peace.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Pentagon is changing the name of the military base Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg, reversing a decision made by a congressionally mandated commission to rename bases that honor Confederate generals.",
      "The Army base will be renamed Fort Bragg, but it will honor a different Bragg than its original namesake, Gen. Braxton Bragg, who fought for the Confederacy. Instead, it will honor Private First Class Roland L. Bragg, who was awarded a Silver Star for actions during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, according to a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "\"This decision reflects the installation's proud history of honoring selfless service and sacrifice in defense of the nation,\" Pentagon Press Secretary John Ullyot said in a statement.",
      "NBC News was first to report the Defense Department was considering this option.",
      "Roland L. Bragg was submitted by the public as one of thousands of candidates for a new name in 2023, but ultimately officials decided to name it Fort Liberty, instead of naming the base after any single person.",
      "On the campaign trail, President Trump criticized the renaming. At an October rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina \u2014 near where the military installation is located \u2014  Mr. Trump said, \"We did win two world wars from Fort Bragg, right?\" and promised, \"We're gonna get it back. We're gonna bring our country back.\"",
      "Before he became defense secretary, Pete Hegseth said the base should never have been renamed. While promoting his book \"War on Warriors,\" Hegseth said, \"We should change it back, because legacy matters. My uncle served at Bragg. I served at Bragg. It breaks a generational link.\"",
      "When he entered the Pentagon for the first time, he referred to Fort Liberty and Fort Moore by their former names, Fort Bragg and Fort Benning.",
      "Fort Bragg and Fort Benning were two of nine bases that the Naming Commission, a commission mandated by Congress to rename bases honoring Confederates, for which new names were suggested.",
      "Back-to-back annual defense authorization bills first banned the military service branches from naming installations after Confederates and then created the Naming Commission. In 2020, Mr. Trump vetoed the defense bill, in part because of the base-renaming provision, but the House and Senate overrode his veto. The service branches, like the Army, still have the authority to rename bases as long as they're not named for Confederates.",
      "The base is home to the Army's Special Operations and Airborne forces, including the 82nd Airborne Division, which is often considered the tip of the spear by the U.S. military because it can rapidly deploy within 18 hours of notification.",
      "Fort Bragg officially became Fort Liberty during a ceremony in June 2023.",
      "The Naming Commission estimated that changing the name of Fort Bragg to Fort Liberty would initially cost over $6 million, according to the commission's report. It's not clear how much it will cost to change the name back to Fort Bragg.",

      "Bannon won't serve time behind bars under the plea agreement, which was laid out during a hearing in a New York courtroom on Tuesday. In exchange for pleading guilty to one count of scheming to defraud in the first degree, he received a sentence of conditional discharge for three years. During that time, Bannon is forbidden from serving as the director of any nonprofit in New York or raise money for charities with assets in the state. He was also forbidden from using donor data stemming from the scheme.",
      "The plea brings to an end a matter that began during President Trump's first administration, just as Mr. Trump has vowed again to beef up border barriers in the early days of his new presidency. Bannon served as Mr. Trump's chief strategist for the first seven months of his presidency in 2017.",
      "Bannon was charged\u00a0in September 2022 for his role in an organization that raised millions for an effort to privately build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. He and the group, which was called We Build the Wall, were accused of defrauding donors of $15 million in donations, though Bannon's lawyer said Tuesday he didn't personally pocket any of the money.",
      "The Trump ally attended the hearing in his usual courtroom attire, a brown jacket and untucked black button-down shirt, over gray jeans. He was charged with two counts of money laundering in the second degree, two counts of conspiracy in the fourth degree, a scheme to defraud in the first degree and conspiracy in the fifth degree. Under the plea agreement, Bannon entered a guilty plea to just the first degree scheme to defraud charge. He also waived his right to appeal the case.",

That prosecution came to an abrupt halt when Bannon was pardoned by Mr. Trump in the final hours of his first term in office. Mr. Trump's pardon authority extends to federal matters, meaning he is not able to pardon Bannon in this case, which is in a New York State court.",
      "Bannon served four months in a federal prison in 2024, after he was found guilty in 2022 of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena to appear before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. He has decried all the cases against him, claiming they were driven by political animus.",
      "The charges against him in New York were brought by Bragg, whose office last year obtained the only criminal conviction in American history of a former or future president.",
      "In that case, Mr. Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in a matter dating back to his first campaign for president, in 2016.",
      "The case, which Mr. Trump has appealed, promises to put Bragg and his office at the center of heightened scrutiny as Mr. Trump and his senior Justice Department leadership vow to investigate those who investigated him.",

    "summary": "In his first international address, Vice President JD Vance also argued AI must remain free from \"ideological bias.\"",
    "story": [
      "Paris, France\u00a0\u2014 Vice President JD Vance, in his first international address, warned European Union countries against overregulation and said the Trump administration wants artificial intelligence to remain free from ideological bias.",
      "\"The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints,\" Vance said while speaking to world leaders and tech executives at the Artificial Intelligence Action summit in Paris, France. \"Now, America cannot and will not accept that, and we think it's a terrible mistake \u2014 not just for the United States of America \u2014 but for your own countries.\"",
      "Vance said the U.S. wants to ensure that the internet is a safe place, but suggested the European Union's Digital Services Act had gone too far, enacting \"massive regulations\" and \"policing so-called misinformation.\"",
      "\"It is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,\" Vance said.",
      "The Digital Services Act seeks to hold platforms more accountable for protecting European users from harmful or illegal content on their sites and imposes fines on violators. Last July, the EU found that the social media platform X, owned by Department of Government Effficiency head and Trump ally Elon Musk, did not comply with the act's transparency or accountability requirements.",
      "Vance told leaders, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, that excessive regulation of the AI sector could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off\" and the Trump administration will make it a priority to promote pro-growth AI policies.",
      "\"I'd like to see that deregulatory flavor making its way into a lot of the conversations at this conference,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance promoted America-first AI policies during his address, echoing a push by French President Emmanuel Macron for the EU to embrace a deregulatory environment to encourage more AI development on the continent.",
      "Macron said Monday that France generates enough clean electric power to build artificial intelligence centers, which require massive amounts of energy.",

      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, dismissed the case against Trump aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira in a one-line order on Tuesday.

The special counsel claimed the president unlawfully held onto sensitive government after returning to his South Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving the White House four years ago, and accused Nauta and de Oliveira of working with Mr. Trump to conceal information from the Justice Department.",

    "summary": "In September, Adams was indicted on five counts including bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Justice told federal prosecutors in New York to drop their corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, citing his \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies.",
      "Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo instructing prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to abandon the charges.",
      "\"You are directed, as authorized by the Attorney General, to dismiss the pending charges,\" Bove wrote in a memo Monday, adding that the department \"reached this conclusion without assessing the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based,\" and \"in no way calls into question the integrity and efforts\" of the prosecutors who brought the case.",
      "Instead, Bove wrote that the \"timing of the charges\" and the former U.S. attorney who brought the case created \"appearances of impropriety,\" and that the probe into Adams' office \"has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime\" that occurred in his city under President Joe Biden.",
      "Bove added that the charges against Adams can be reconsidered by the Southern District of New York after the November 2025 New York City mayoral election.",
      "The stunning decision comes after department lawyers met with Adams' attorneys and Manhattan federal prosecutors in late January, where senior officials discussed dropping the charges against the embattled mayor.",
      "In September, Adams was indicted on five counts including bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. The mayor's trial is scheduled to begin in April.",
      "\"As I said from the outset, the mayor is innocent \u2014 and he would prevail. Today he has,\" Adams' attorney, Alex Spiro, said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice has reevaluated this case and determined it should not go forward. There is good reason for that. The facts of the case are clear: the mayor never used his official position for personal benefit. Nor did he have any role in violating campaign finance laws.\"",
      "CBS News has also reached out to Mayor Adams' office for comment.",
      "The decision to drop the charges will still need to be formally submitted by prosecutors and approved by the judge overseeing the case.",
      "Since his indictment, Adams has cozied up to President Trump and members of his administration, meeting with Mr. Trump in Florida before he took office and attending his inauguration in Washington, D.C. The mayor also attended the National Prayer Breakfast in the capital last week. Adams said that he did not discuss his corruption case with Mr. Trump in their Florida meeting.",
      "Federal immigration agents have stepped up enforcement operations across the country, including in New York. But the city has largely avoided being targeted by the Trump administration, which sued Chicago and the state of Illinois over their immigration policies last week. City Hall sources recently told CBS News New York that they believed the city was spared because of the mayor's relationship with the White House.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem recently said that Adams has been cooperative with DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.",
      "Adams has stressed that DHS operations in the city are targeting violent criminals, and said in late January that he had directed the NYPD to assist federal law enforcement with a \"targeted operation\" to arrest a suspected gang member.",
      "\"As I have repeatedly said, we will not hesitate to partner with federal authorities to bring violent criminals to justice \u2014 just as we have done for years,\" he said in a statement on Jan. 28. \"Our commitment to protecting our city's law-abiding residents, both citizens and immigrants, remains unwavering.\"",
      "But his willingness to cooperate with federal authorities has raised alarms among some state lawmakers and advocacy groups, who have criticized a memo Adams issued before Mr. Trump's inauguration detailing how city officials should interact with federal immigration agents. The memo included a line that said: \"[If] you reasonably feel threatened or fear for your safety, you should give the officer the information they have asked for or let them enter the site.\"",
      "New York is a \"sanctuary city,\" meaning local officials and resources can't be used to aid civil immigration enforcement, with exceptions for violent criminals. Adams' critics said his memo opened the door to city officials violating sanctuary city laws. A City Hall spokesperson said the instructions were not meant to be blanket guidance for every city agency.",
      "Adams is one of four mayors who have been called to testify before Congress on March 5 by House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer as part of his investigation into sanctuary cities.",
      "In his criminal case, Adams was accused of accepting illegal campaign donations, as well as flight upgrades and other travel benefits, from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals who were attempting to influence his decision-making. Multiple members of his administration have been investigated and charged in the probe. One of Adams' former City Hall aides agreed to plead guilty to charges stemming from the investigation last week.",
      "In January, federal prosecutors hinted that additional charges might be coming against the mayor, saying in a court filing that investigators have \"continued to identify additional individuals involved in Adams' conduct, and to uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams.\" Court records showed that the grand jury in the case heard from new witnesses as recently as December.",
      "Adams has claimed that he was prosecuted by the Justice Department under Biden because he criticized Biden's immigration policies. Mr. Trump has hinted that he would be open to pardoning Adams, saying in a press conference in mid-December that he didn't \"know the facts\" of Adams' case but thought \"that he was treated pretty unfairly.\"",

      "The system's new description for the Gulf, an ocean basin that shares nearly equal lengths of shoreline with the U.S. and Mexico, reads: \"The Gulf of America, formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico, with an average depth 5300 ft is a major body of water bordered and nearly landlocked by North America with the Gulf's eastern, northern, and northwestern shores in the U.S. and its southwestern and southern shores in Mexico.\"",
      "The description notes that the change complies with Mr. Trump's order titled \"Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness,\" which he signed on Inauguration Day. Google previously acknowledged Mr. Trump's executive order would affect what U.S. users see in their Maps applications but said the company would take its cue from the Board on Geographic Names, which handles federal nomenclature, to act on the directive.",
      "Although people accessing Google Maps from inside the U.S. will see the name Gulf of America, users in Mexico will continue to see the basin's earlier title. Maps users everywhere else in the world will see both names, Google said.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 06:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Monday ordered new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. Experts say some products could become pricier.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is again turning to tariffs to advance his trade agenda, signing new orders to place 25% import duties on all steel and aluminum imports. Although the idea is to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair competition, consumers could end up paying more for some products that use the metals, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump, who signed two executive orders on Monday imposing the new metal tariffs, has said that such duties can help revitalize key U.S. industries. For instance, some companies could opt to open new plants in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, while buyers could shift to U.S.-made products rather than pricier imports.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands we need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "The new metal tariffs affect a total of about $50 billion in imports. The U.S. imports roughly a quarter of domestically used steel, with most of it sourced from Canada and Mexico, along with countries including Brazil, South Korea and Japan, according to the International Trade Administration.",
      "Who pays for tariffs",
      "Because U.S. importers pay tariffs on overseas goods directly to the federal government, the costs are typically passed onto American consumers, trade experts told CBS MoneyWatch. That means some products that rely on steel and aluminum, such as vehicles and appliances, are likely to become more expensive if the steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"If you put a tax on imported steel and aluminum, you will raise the price of everything that uses that \u2014 cars first and foremost,\" said Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research.",
      "A typical car contains roughly 1,000 pounds of steel at a cost of about about $6,000 to $7,000 per vehicle, Baker told CBS MoneyWatch. That means adding a 25% tariff could increase the cost of a car by $1,000 to $1,500, he estimated. Although some automakers might shift to buying more U.S.-made steel, American manufacturers would also likely boost their prices, taking advantage of the higher costs for foreign-made steel, he added.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. car prices could rise even more sharply if Mr. Trump proceeds with 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian imports, now subject to a 30-day pause\u00a0as officials negotiate. The impact of those tariffs would\u00a0add $6,250 to the average $25,000 price of a car shipped into the U.S. from those two countries, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Under Mr. Trump's orders, steel imports from all countries will now face 25% tariffs, while aluminum tariffs will be raised from 10% to 25%. The orders were instituted under\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the president to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are determined to threaten national security.",
      "Tariffs could drive up inflation",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2014 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that, in addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs, he planned to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on Tuesday or Wednesday, which he said will take effect immediately. Under that scenario, the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods.",
      "\"If they charge us, we charge them \u2026 every country,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.\"",
      "Economists and Wall Street analysts warn that new U.S. tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to flare even as many Americans say they continue struggling with the cost of living. Mr. Trump's latest proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, plus the reciprocal tariffs, could boost the core personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 a key measure of inflation \u2014 by an additional 0.4 percentage points, Deutsche Bank economists estimate in a Feb. 10 research report.",
      "If the postponed tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada go into effect after the 30-day pause, inflation could rise higher than 3.5%, they added.",
      "The long-term impact on U.S. prices is less certain and is contingent on how manufacturers react.",
      "\"U.S. steel prices will likely rise in the near term if these tariffs are implemented in full,\" economists with Capital Economics said in a report. \"However, higher prices might incentivize greater domestic production and help prices to fall back before long.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, steel producers increased their output after tariffs were imposed, while domestic demand fell. Within 12 months, those factors contributed to steel prices declining to their level before the tariffs were imposed, Capital Economics noted.",
      "A jump in prices, coupled with rising inflation expectations, would come at an awkward time for consumers and for Mr. Trump. While he has received positive approval ratings for his first three weeks in office, two-thirds of voters said that they don't believe he's doing enough to lower the price of goods and services, according to a recent CBS News poll.",
      "Inflation around the U.S. remains sticky, with the Federal Reserve pausing additional interest rate cuts until the rate of consumer price gains falls closer to its 2% annual target. Consumer Price Index data for January, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, is expected to show that prices rose 2.9% in January, unchanged from the prior month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",

      "President Trump issued an ultimatum on Monday to Hamas, saying that if all remaining Israeli hostages are not released from Gaza by noon on Saturday, then \"all hell is going to break loose.\"",
      "Asked by reporters for details on what that meant, Mr. Trump initially responded: \"You'll find out, and they'll find out, too. Hamas will find out what I mean.\"",
      "He then said ending the ceasefire that took effect on January 19 would be \"Israel's decision,\" but that he felt it would be \"appropriate\" to cancel the agreement if the hostages aren't released by his deadline. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal negotiated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, a total of 33 Israeli hostages were to be released during a six-week first phase, in exchange for the release of about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.",
      "As of Monday, about three weeks into phase-one, about half of the hostages due to be released have thus far been freed, in line with the schedule laid out in the agreement. There are 76 hostages still held by Hamas or its allies in Gaza. On Tuesday, the IDF announced that the oldest one of them, 86-year-old Shlomo Mantzur, had been murdered by Hamas.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comments about the hostages while signing executive orders on Monday at the White House. He spoke hours after Hamas said it was delaying the next release of hostages, which was scheduled for Saturday, as a spokesman\u00a0accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement, including by targeting Palestinians in Gaza with airstrikes.",
      "\"This includes delays in allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, targeting them with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas of the Strip, and failing to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed,\" said Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz said Hamas' plan to delay the next release of hostages was \"a complete violation\" of the ceasefire agreement and that he had instructed the Israeli military to be on the highest level of alert. The prime minister's coordinator for hostages said the Israeli government intended to live up to its end of the agreement.",
      "But as Mr. Trump threatened to upend that agreement, he said Saturday's delayed hostage release \u2014 which was expected to see the release of another three hostages held by Hamas in exchange for dozens more Palestinian prisoners \u2014 should include all of the remaining hostages.",
      "\"I'd say they ought to  be returned by 12 o'clock on  Saturday,\" Mr. Trump said. \"All of them,  not in  drips and drabs,  not two and one and three and four and two.\"",
      "A senior Hamas leader told the French news agency AFP on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's warning over the hostages \"further complicates matters.\" It came just days after negotiations were meant to begin in earnest to lay out the terms of the second phase of the ceasefire.",
      "\"Trump must remember that there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties and this is the only way to return the prisoners (hostages),\" Sami Abu Zuhri said. \"The language of threats has no value and further complicates matters,\" he said.",
      "Separately, in part of an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier that was recorded Saturday but only released on Monday, Mr. Trump said Palestinians would not have the right to return to Gaza and he \"would own this,\" referring to his statements last week that the U.S. would \"take over\" and \"own\" the Gaza Strip and that Palestinians should not return.",
      "Israel and Hamas have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire went into effect last month, freeing 18 hostages, including Keith Siegel, who has dual U.S.-Israeli nationality, and over 730 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "The most recent exchange, which took place on Feb. 8, caused some alarm because of the emaciated condition of the three male hostages who were released by Hamas. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the three male hostages \"endured hell itself,\" after seeing the state of the men.",
      "The plan put forth by the president has drawn increasingly robust backing from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who on Monday called it \"new, creative, and revolutionary,\" but it has been roundly condemned by many nations in the region and around the world, including the neighbors of Israel to which Mr. Trump has said Gaza's population should be relocated.",

    "summary": "President Trump removed the director of the Office of Government Ethics, the independent agency responsible for overseeing ethics rules for the executive branch.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday removed the director of the Office of Government Ethics, the independent agency responsible for overseeing ethics rules and financial disclosures for the executive branch.",
      "\"OGE has been notified that the President is removing David Huitema as the director of OGE,\" the office said in a notice on its website. \"OGE is reverting to an Acting Director.\"",
      "Huitema was appointed to a five-year term by former President Biden. He was confirmed by the Senate in November 2024 and sworn in on December 16, 2024. The office's website initially listed Shelley Finlayson as its acting director. Finlayson has been at the agency since 2006, serving most recently as chief of staff. But Mr. Trump signed a document Monday evening tapping Doug Collins, a Republican former member of Congress and current Department of Veterans Affairs secretary, to be the acting director of OGE.",
      "The move to oust Huitema comes two weeks after Mr. Trump fired at least 17 inspectors general from their roles as watchdogs without explanation, and as Mr. Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency task force have upended multiple government agencies.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "OGE collects both confidential and public financial disclosures, as well as ethics agreements and other forms from government officials, from the president and vice president to high-ranking appointees and Cabinet nominees. The office works to identify and prevent conflicts of interest.",
      "\"The primary mission of the executive branch ethics program is to prevent conflicts of interest on the part of executive branch employees, by working to ensure that they make impartial decisions based on the public interest, serve as good stewards of public resources, and loyally adhere to the Constitution and laws of the United States,\" OGE's mission statement reads.",
      "Six months into Mr. Trump's first term in 2017,\u00a0Walter Shaub\u00a0resigned as the head of OGE, saying the Trump White House abandoned the \"norms and ethical traditions of the executive branch that have made our ethics program the gold standard in the world until now.\"",
      "Good government groups raised concerns about the removal of accountability officials at government agencies without explanation.",
      "\"The removal of David Huitema as the director of the Office of Government Ethics is the latest in a string of firings directly aimed at the accountability offices in the executive branch,\" said Caitlin MacNeal, communications director for the Project on Government Oversight. \"The firings remove our systems of checks and balances at a time when the wealthiest man in the world is operating inside the government with vast and unprecedented financial conflicts of interest. So it's particularly alarming that the administration has fired the official in specifically charged with policing ethics.\"",
      "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington executive director Donald K. Sherman said that by \"firing the head of the Office of Government Ethics, President Trump is continuing his purge of any independent officials tasked with holding him and his administration accountable to the law and ethical standards.\"",
      "\"This follows his firing of the head of the Office of Special Counsel and 17 inspectors general,\" Sherman said. \"Together, these actions will streamline any efforts he and his administration make to personally profit, install loyalists and avoid oversight of corruption and waste. By all indications, Trump is planning to run a lawless administration and these unprecedented moves are an alarming first step to put those plans into action.\"",

    "story": [
      "Flagstaff, Arizona \u2014 Scientists have long suspected that Mexican long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been elusive.",
      "Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird feeders.",
      "Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva swabbing campaign.",
      "The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA - or eDNA - to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home.",
      "The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988 and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It's an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants.",
      "Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated.",
      "\"If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you're not guaranteed to be successful,\" said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. \"By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit.\"",
      "Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall.",
      "The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall.",
      "Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge.",
      "Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months.",
      "\"There's a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what's in the database,\" Riley said. \"A little bit like a Google search - you've got your question, you're asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you've got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.\"",
      "Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats.",
      "\"They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and hummingbird feeders,\" Lear said."

    "story": [
      "Cambridge, England \u2014 Scientists have long said cutting methane emissions is key to addressing climate change, but many big industries aren't readily able to curb their production of the harmful greenhouse gas. A British company says it has an answer: Turn methane into something else.",
      "Methane is a menace. Climate scientists say the invisible gas warms the Earth's atmosphere 84 times faster than carbon dioxide. It's released into the atmosphere by organic material, such as food waste, rotting at landfill sites, sewage treatment facilities and by the digestive systems of cows.",
      "Levidian \u2014 a climate tech business in Cambridge, England \u2014 set out to tackle this climate change challenge, by giving methane a makeover.",
      "\"The magic happens in here,\" the company's CEO John Hartley told CBS News as he led our team on a guided tour of Levidian's patented LOOP system \u2014 a machine with a giant metal hopper shaped like a balloon.",
      "The technology uses microwave energy and a special nozzle system to split methane molecules into the gas' component parts \u2014 hydrogen and carbon \u2014 and captures them.",
      "Hydrogen is increasingly sought after, as it can be used to power factories, trucks, ships and other machinery. Levidian said it's a clean fuel, because, when burned, it yields heat and energy, but the only emission is water vapor, no carbon dioxide.",
      "The carbon from the broken-down methane, meanwhile, falls into the hopper as a solid called graphene, which has been known to science for only about two decades and which is often touted as the strongest material in the world.",

      "They have also tried adding it to concrete.",
      "\"Without graphene, it tends to crumble a lot easier, but with graphene it's much stronger,\" she said.",
      "The super-strong but flexible material can even be included in the manufacture of medical gloves.",
      "\"When surgeons do the 'snap test,' they're trying to check if it will break, and that doesn't happen when you add graphene in \u2014 it makes them much stronger and more puncture resistant,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Scientists say graphene also helps boost battery life in electric vehicles, and it can be mixed into plastic to help manufactures use less petroleum-derived materials in their bottles.",
      "Researchers only discovered graphene 20 years ago, at the University of Manchester, and Levidian sees years of growth ahead for the product.",
      "\"When you get in your car, you will have graphene enhanced tires that last longer. The battery in that car, if it's electric, will take you further because it will have more capacity to charge faster, and the concrete you use in the building you go into will be more durable and have a smaller carbon footprint,\" she predicted, adding that even \"the clothes that you wear might have graphene in them so they're more sustainable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January, despite an abnormally chilly United States, a cooling La Nina and predictions of a slightly less hot 2025, according to the European climate service Copernicus.",
      "The surprising January heat record coincides with a new study by a climate science heavyweight, former top NASA scientist James Hansen, and others arguing that global warming is accelerating. It's a claim that's dividing the research community.",
      "January 2025 globally was 0.09 degrees Celsius (0.16 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than January 2024, the previous hottest January, and was 1.75 C (3.15 F) warmer than it was before industrial times, Copernicus calculated. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Scientists won't regard the limit as breached unless and until global temperatures stay above it for 20 years.",
      "Copernicus records date to 1940, but other U.S. and British records go back to 1850, and scientists using proxies such as tree rings say this era is the warmest in about 120,000 years \u2014 or since the start of human civilization.",
      "By far the biggest driver of record heat is greenhouse gas buildup from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, but the natural contributions to temperature change have not been acting quite as expected, said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate for the European weather agency.",
      "The big natural factor in global temperatures is usually the natural cycle of changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean waters. When the central Pacific is especially warm, it's an El Nino and global temperatures tend to spike. Last year was a substantial El Nino, though it ended last June and the year was even warmer than initially expected, the hottest on record.",
      "El Nino's cooler flip side, a La Nina, tends to dampen the effects of global warming, making record temperatures far less likely. A La Nina started in January after brewing for months. Just last month, climate scientists were predicting that 2025 wouldn't be as hot as 2024 or 2023, with the La Nina a major reason.",
      "\"Even though the equatorial Pacific isn't creating conditions that are warming for our global climate, we're still seeing record temperatures,\" Burgess said, adding much of that is because of record warmth in the rest of the world's oceans.",
      "Usually after an El Nino like last year, temperatures fall rapidly, but \"we've not seen that,\" Burgess told The Associated Press.",
      "For Americans, news of a record warm January might seem odd given how cold it was. But the U.S. is just a tiny fraction of the planet's surface, and \"a much larger area of the planet's surface was much, much warmer than average,\" Burgess said.",
      "January was unseasonably mild in the Arctic. Parts of the Canadian Arctic had temperatures 54 degrees Fahrneheit warmer than average and temperatures got so warm sea ice started melting in places, Burgess said.",
      "Copernicus said the Arctic this month tied the January record for lowest sea ice. The U.S.-based National Snow and Ice Data Center had it as second-lowest, behind 2018.",
      "February has already started cooler than last year, Burgess said.",
      "But don't count 2025 out in the race for hottest year, said Hansen, the former NASA scientist who has been called the godfather of climate science. He's now at Columbia University.",
      "In a study in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Hansen and colleagues said the last 15 years have warmed at about twice the rate of the previous 40 years.",
      "\"I'm confident that this higher rate will continue for at least several years,\" Hansen told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Over the full year, it's going to be nip-and-tuck between 2024 and 2025.\"",
      "There's been a noticeable temperature rise even when taking out El Nino variations and expected climate change since 2020, Hansen said. He noted recent shipping regulations that have resulted in reduced sulfur pollution, which reflects some sunlight away from Earth and effectively reduces warming. And that will continue, he said.",
      "\"The persistence of record warmth through 2023, 2024 and now into the first month of 2025 is jarring to say the least,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the Hansen study. \"There seems little doubt that global warming and the impacts of climate change are accelerating.\"",
      "But Princeton's Gabe Vecchi and University of Pennsylvania's Michael Mann said they don't agree with Hansen on acceleration. Vecchi said there's not enough data to show that this isn't random chance. Mann said temperature increases are still within what climate models forecast.",

    "title": "NASA to study \"city-killer\" asteroid as odds of hitting Earth go up",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:04:58 -0500",
    "summary": "Astronomers will use the Webb telescope to closely monitor the size and trajectory of an asteroid that has a slim chance of striking Earth in 2032.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study an asteroid that has a small chance of striking Earth less than eight years from now. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have increased slightly since then, according to the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say it currently carries a 2% risk of making contact with Earth when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:00:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Butch Wilmore have not been \"abandoned\" in space, as NASA considers plans to speed their return.",
    "story": [
      "Contrary to a recent social media post from President Trump, Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore have not been \"virtually abandoned\" in space, despite a mission that's been extended from a little more than one week to more than nine months.",
      "\"I don't think I'm abandoned. I don't think we're stuck up here,\" she  told CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson during an in-flight  interview airing Friday night. \"We've got food. We've got  clothes. We have a ride home in case anything really bad does happen to  the International Space Station.",
      "\"We're in a posture ... where we  have the International Space Station fully manned and doing what the  taxpayers wanted, to do world-class science. And so I feel honored, like  I said, to be here and a part of the team.\"",
      "NASA is finalizing plans to bring Williams and Wilmore back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, around March 19, sources say. That would shorten their extended stay in orbit by about two weeks compared to a previous plan for late March or April.",
      "The slightly earlier trip home would be possible if the next set of station fliers, known as Crew 10, is switched to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as mid March. The switch is needed, sources say, because work to prepare the original SpaceX ferry ship for its maiden flight is taking longer than expected.",
      "In any case, after a weeklong handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams would undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the same Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams' return.",
      "Why the mission extended for months",
      "Assuming the dates hold up \u2014 and there are multiple variables in play \u2014 Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since their\u00a0launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week, the time needed to carry out the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.",
      "But the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and helium leaks shortly after launch that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could hitch a ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA initially planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but last December, another month was tacked onto the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch. Sources now say more time is needed to finish that work.",
      "Trump speaks out on crew's delay",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, saying in a social media post that he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\" He also named Musk, a billionaire\u00a0supporter of the Trump campaign, to head the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is charged with cutting the size of the federal government.",
      "Musk said in an earlier post\u00a0on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "NASA's administrator at the time, Bill Nelson, was appointed by the Biden administration, but the decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission was made by the agency's Commercial Crew and International Space Station programs. The plan has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 Dragon was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "As such, there is no need to \"go get\" the astronauts \u2014 their ride home has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",
      "\"We don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team.\"",
      "In the interview, Dickerson asked Williams about the president's comments on their mission.",
      "\"Trump said you and Butch Wilmore, who is your Starliner crewmate, had been \u2014 this is the president's words \u2014 'virtually abandoned,'\" Dickerson asked. \"Do you feel abandoned up there, commander?\"",
      "\"I don't think those words are quite accurate,\" Williams replied. \"Both Butch and I have lived up here on the space station before. We know how NASA and our commercial partners work together. So we expected that we would be up here for a little while.",
      "\"We're part of something bigger than ourselves. We're part of the International Space Station, and we have obligations to our international partners to do science and exploration while we're up here. So yeah, we knew this was going to happen, so no, we don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team, and that's a huge honor.\"",
      "Asked why the Crew 9 Dragon couldn't return to Earth sooner, given that it's already docked at the station, Williams said that would leave the station with a single U.S. crew member aboard, Don Pettit, who was launched to the station last year with two cosmonauts aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "With only a single U.S. astronaut aboard to respond to emergencies, operate power, life support and other systems in the NASA segment of the station, high-priority research would grind to a halt. Standard practice is for NASA to launch a replacement crew about a week before the outgoing crew's departure for an orderly handover.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams said. \"And the space station is big, it's a building, it's the size of a football field.",
      "\"Things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside (or) outside, and so having additional people to be able to do that, that capability, is really important.\"",
      "NASA has tentatively decided to switch the Crew 10 fliers \u2014 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon to avoid adding even more time to Crew 9's already extended mission.",
      "Crew 10 is expected to be assigned to a Crew Dragon that had been earmarked for a commercial flight to the station, a mission known as AX-4 that was booked by Houston-based Axiom Space. That non-NASA crew would instead use the original Crew 10 Dragon later this spring.",
      "NASA would not comment on the plans. A spokeswoman said \"we're not able to confirm any details reported on Crew 9 return at this time. We are working through coordination of forward plans for the agency's Commercial Crew Program missions with its various stakeholders. We will share more information as soon as we can.\"",
      "For her part, Williams said she just wanted \"the right decision to be made, in the best interest of all of us, of Crew 10, of course, and us. I'm happy either way. Eight days turned into a couple more months than that, a couple more months, whatever, it doesn't really matter. The right decision just has to be made.\"",

      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at US space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 1.6% chance the asteroid will strike Earth on December 22, 2032.",

      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",

      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",

      "Cambridge, England \u2014 Scientists have long said cutting methane emissions is key to addressing climate change, but many big industries aren't readily able to curb their production of the harmful greenhouse gas. A British company says it has an answer: Turn methane into something else.",

    "story": [
      "Scrim, a runaway white Terrier who has\u00a0captivated the attention of many in New Orleans after pulling off two escapes last year has been rescued for a third time, a local animal group announced Tuesday.",
      "After months on the run, Scrim was found Tuesday morning by a member of the nonprofit animal group Trap Dat Cat, according to Zeus' Rescues, a second animal group.",
      "Scrum had been missing since he jumped 13 feet out of a second-story window in November while being cared for in the home of Michelle Cheramie of Zeus' Rescues.",
      "\"He has had quite an ordeal since leaping from a second story window in November,\" Cheramie wrote in an Instagram post Wednesday. \"He had to start over in a completely different part of New Orleans. He spent a month trying to find a way from Uptown to Mid-City \u2014 and succeeded! On Christmas Day, he found himself lost in Old Metairie, vanished, and reappeared in Harrahan, and then found his way back to Mid-City. He survived thunderstorms and New Years fireworks. Loud noises terrify him. He made it to the start of Mardi Gras season and a Super Bowl.\"",
      "After his latest rescue, Scrim underwent a veterinary exam and X-rays, and apart from tapeworms and intestinal parasites, he was found to be in \"good health,\" Cheramie said. Once fully recovered, Zeus \"has a new home lined up with plenty outdoor space and other dog friends to help him socialize,\" she added.",
      "Cheramie first saved Scrim in early 2024, but he broke loose in April and managed to stay on the run while still being spotted on local security cameras around the city.",
      "He was later found in October and received medical treatment for his injuries, including two embedded projectiles, likely from a pellet gun, abrasions, and a missing piece of his ear.",
      "Scrim's back-to-back escapes led him to go viral. Dozens of people in New Orleans called in to report Scrim sightings, and a map was even tracking his movements in an effort to catch him.",
      "Zeus' Rescues, in collaboration with community volunteers and Trap Dat Cat, set up food stations and trail cameras to monitor his movements after his November escape, according to CBS affiliate WWL-TV. The runaway dog also seems to have managed to make it through a historic 10 inches of snow in New Orleans in January.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 21:08:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Influenza trends have reached record highs in recent weeks.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, more people in the U.S. died of influenza than from COVID-19 in the week ending on Jan. 25, according to weekly figures published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "For the week ending on Jan. 25, nearly 1.7% of all deaths nationwide were attributed to the flu, compared to roughly 1.5% being the result of COVID-19, according to CDC data. Rates of influenza hospitalizations are more than three times higher than COVID-19 hospitalizations amid this season's record wave of flu infections.",
      "Partial CDC data suggest that influenza deaths may have already reached as high as 2% of deaths for the week ending on Feb. 1, also surpassing COVID-19 mortality nationwide which was holding at around 1.5%. More complete data is expected to be published Friday.",
      "In 22 states, the rate of influenza deaths has been outpacing COVID-19 deaths throughout the first five weeks of 2025.",
      "The gap between flu and COVID-19 deaths is biggest in California, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon and Wyoming, where the percentage of weekly deaths from flu are at least double those from COVID-19.",
      "Health officials track the percentage of weekly deaths as an early indicator of trends in flu and COVID-19 deaths, since it can take several weeks for all deaths to be confirmed and counted.",
      "The agency's modelers estimate that between 13,000 and 65,000 flu deaths have occurred so far this season, already above the range of influenza deaths for all of last season.",
      "That is also a higher range than the between 18,000 and 31,000 deaths from COVID-19 that the CDC estimates have happened so far this winter.",
      "This winter's COVID-19 wave has been smaller than previous waves of the virus, measured both in emergency rooms and hospitalizations.",
      "No new highly mutated variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 has emerged to drive a major surge of infections, unlike several previous waves, and rates of vaccinations have outpaced several previous seasons in older adults who are more vulnerable to severe disease.",
      "By contrast, the CDC has tracked influenza activity climbing to some of the highest rates seen since the peak of the swine flu pandemic in 2009. Levels are \"very high\" in 33 states and the District of Columbia, the CDC said on Friday.",
      "Influenza vaccinations have lagged in some age groups, CDC data suggests, especially in children. Less than 45% of children in the U.S. have gotten a flu shot, down from more than 58% at this time of year in 2020.",
      "\"Foremost, anyone who has not been vaccinated for flu this season should get vaccinated immediately. Flu activity remains elevated and continues to increase across the country,\" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a Feb. 10 statement.",
      "Several factors can impact flu activity in the U.S., he said, including which flu viruses are circulating and the immunity people have from prior infections and vaccinations.",
      "\"While flu activity and flu season severity cannot be predicted and can vary from season to season, it is expected to see flu activity elevated and increasing at this time of the year,\" said Prince.",

      "Musk, the world's wealthiest man, took questions for the first time since the president gave him broad authority to overhaul the executive branch.",
      "\"The people voted for major government reform and that's what the people are going to get,\" Musk said, with his young son by his side. \"They're going to get what they voted for.\"",
      "Underscoring his support for Musk's work, Mr. Trump signed an executive order requiring federal agency heads to coordinate with DOGE to shrink the size of the federal government. The order, according to a White House fact sheet, directs heads of agencies to \"coordinate and consult with DOGE to shrink the size of the federal workforce and limit hiring to essential positions.\"",
      "Musk said it's \"essential\" that the federal government reduce spending, with interest on the debt accounting for a growing portion of the budget. The Trump administration and DOGE in particular are going agency by agency, seeking to slash workforces and programs.",
      "The rapid downsizing and freezing of government programs, which Democrats call illegal, has run into widespread legal opposition in the courts, with dozens of lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of Musk and his team dismantling agencies and programs established by Congress. Judges have blocked the administration's actions on a range of fronts, including by barring Musk's team from gaining access to sensitive Treasury Department data and pausing a deadline for \"deferred resignations\" offered to federal workers.",
      "Musk told reporters that federal workers need to be held accountable, calling the bureaucracy an \"unelected\" fourth branch of government. Musk's own financial disclosure report will\u00a0remain confidential.",
      "Asked about any personal conflicts he has and whether he's policing himself, Musk did not answer directly but said the DOGE website is explaining what it's doing, an apparent reference to the group's account on X, which details contracts that federal agencies have canceled. Pressed a second time, Musk said the public can question whether he's benefiting from DOGE's actions.",
      "\"You can see whether I'm doing something that's benefitting one of my companies or not,\" Musk said. \"It's totally obvious.\"",
      "Musk, whose web of companies have billions of dollars worth of contracts with the federal government, said he doesn't think he'll be able to get away with anything untoward.",
      "\"I'll be scrutinized nonstop,\" he said.",
      "The president said if he thought Musk had a conflict of interest with some project, he wouldn't let Musk proceed.",
      "Mr. Trump was asked if he plans to abide by the courts' decisions limiting his administration's actions. Vice President JD Vance and other Trump allies have said the court's had no role in constraining the executive branch's legitimate authority, raising fears among Democrats that Mr. Trump could defy a court order and spark a constitutional crisis.",
      "\"Well, I always abide by the courts, and then I have to appeal it,\" the president said, while questioning why a judge would want to block his agenda.",
      "Musk recognized there could be errors, and acknowledged that \"some of the things that I say will be incorrect,\" referencing a false claim that the U.S. was planning to send tens of millions of dollars worth of condoms to Gaza.",
      "\"We are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we will fix the mistakes very quickly,\" Musk said.",

      "The White House demanded early Tuesday that the AP alter its style guidance to use the name Gulf of America versus using the Gulf of Mexico, AP\u00a0executive editor Julie Pace\u00a0said in a statement. President Trump renamed the body of water to the Gulf of America through an executive order last month. Later on Tuesday, Pace said the White House stopped an AP reporter from attending Mr. Trump's executive order signing in the Oval Office.",
      "\"It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism. Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP's speech not only severely impedes the public's access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment,\" Pace said.",
      "The AP's style guide, which many newsrooms across the country follow, published on Jan. 23, two days after the president signed his executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico, states that Mr. Trump's order only carries authority within the United States and other countries do not have to recognize the change.",
      "\"As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences,\" the guidance reads.",
      "In his executive order, Mr. Trump also reverted the name of North America's tallest peak in Alaska, Denali, back to Mount McKinley. The AP's guidance says that it will be referring to it as Mount McKinley.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump hosted Jordan's King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday and renewed his suggestions that Gaza could be emptied of residents, controlled by the U.S. and redeveloped as a tourist area \u2014 a plan that could likely only work if the Arab nation agrees to accept more refugees.",
      "The pair met in the Oval Office, where Mr. Trump suggested he wouldn't withhold U.S. aid to Jordan, Egypt or other Arab nations, if they don't agree to dramatically increase the number of people from Gaza they take in.",
      "\"I don't have to threaten that. I do believe we're above that,\" Mr. Trump said. That contradicted his previous suggestion that holding back aid was a possibility.",
      "Abdullah was asked repeatedly about Mr. Trump's audacious plan to remake the Middle East, but didn't make substantive comments on it nor the idea that his country could accept large numbers of new refugees from Gaza. He did say that Jordan would accept roughly 2,000 children with cancer and other health problems \"right away.\" Mr. Trump said he did not know about that commitment, which he called \"a beautiful gesture.\"",
      "The president also repeated suggestions that the U.S. could come to control Gaza, but he said that it wouldn't require committing funds and would come to fruition. He also said that would be possible \"under the U.S. authority,\" without elaborating what that actually was.",
      "\"We're not going to buy anything. We're going to have it,\" Mr. Trump said of U.S. control in Gaza. He suggested that the redeveloped area could have new hotels, office buildings and houses and \"and we'll make it exciting.\"",
      "\"I can tell you about real estate. They're going to be in love with it,\" Mr. Trump, who built a New York real estate empire that catapulted him to fame, said of Gaza's residents, while also insisting that he personally would not be involved in development.",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump used the meeting to renew his suggestions that a tenuous ceasefire between Hamas and Israel could be canceled if Hamas doesn't release all of the remaining hostages it is holding by midday on Saturday.",
      "\"I don't think they're going to make the deadline, personally,\" Mr. Trump said of Hamas. \"They want to play tough guy. We'll see how tough they are.\"",
      "The king's visit is happening at a perilous moment for the ongoing ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas is accusing Israel of violating the truce and said it is pausing future releases of hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly proposed the U.S. take control of Gaza and turn it into \"the Riviera of the Middle East,\" with Palestinians in the war-torn territory pushed into neighboring nations with no right of return.",
      "His Tuesday comments contradicted his Monday suggestions that, if necessary, he would withhold U.S. funding from Jordan and Egypt \u2014 longtime U.S. allies and among the top recipients of its foreign aid \u2014 as a means of persuading them to accept additional Palestinians from Gaza.",
      "Jordan is home to more than 2 million Palestinians and, along with other Arab states, has flatly rejected Mr. Trump's plan to relocate civilians from Gaza. Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said last week that his country's opposition to Mr. Trump's idea was \"firm and unwavering.\"",
      "Besides concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily.",
      "The king is also meeting with top Trump administration officials during his visit, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He is the third foreign leader to hold an in-person meeting with Mr. Trump since his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The president announced his ideas for resettling Palestinians from Gaza and taking ownership of the territory for the U.S. during a press conference last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He initially didn't rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure Gaza but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of the territory, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan.",
      "After Mr. Trump's initial comments, Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza \"temporarily\" and sought an \"interim\" period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordnance and reconstruction.",
      "But asked in an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier that aired Monday if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory under his plan, he replied, \"No, they wouldn't.\"",

His most recent appearance before the bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempt, last December, devolved into a shouting match when Republican Rep. Pat Fallon accused him of \"playing politics\" when he attended a 9/11 memorial event with the nation's top leaders.",

The complaint\u00a0also claims the coffee chain's hiring policies have led to slower service and higher prices for consumers because it isn't recruiting the most qualified workers.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, claims Starbucks' diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies are \"mere pretext for its actual commitment to unlawful discrimination.\"",
      "The litigation comes just weeks after President Trump signed an executive order\u00a0banning diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0programs across the U.S. government, while also directing the U.S. attorney general to \"encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "A number of major retailers and other companies, along with other organizations, have recently rolled back their DEI initiatives amid pushback from conservative activists, including Ford, Google, McDonald's, Meta, Target and Walmart.",

We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\"",
      "The company added, \"Our hiring practices are inclusive fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time.\"",

      "While Starbucks' prices and wait times have been a focus of consumer complaints in recent years, experts haven't generally blamed hiring practices for the chain's problems. Instead, analysts have pointed to inflation, which has pushed up the prices of ingredients like coffee and milk, as well as Starbucks' vast number of drink customizations, which can slow orders.",

      "After a five-to-seven-day handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, will undock and head back to Earth.",

That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",

    "story": [
      "Louisiana will resume executions after a 15-year hiatus, forging ahead on plans set in motion last spring to carry out death sentences using nitrogen hypoxia.",
      "The office of Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry released a summary of the state's updated execution protocol on Monday alongside a pledge to move forward with the death penalty for the first time since 2010. There are currently 63 people on death row in Louisiana, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, but legal challenges, political opposition and problems obtaining lethal injection drugs have kept the state from actually executing people for more than a decade.",
      "\"The time for broken promises has ended; we will carry out these sentences and justice will be dispensed,\" Landry said in a statement. \"I expect our DA's to finalize these cases and the courts to move swiftly to bring justice to the crime victims who have waited for too long.\"",
      "There are technically three execution methods approved in Louisiana. Lethal injection is the default method, and electrocution and nitrogen hypoxia are alternatives. State legislators last year authorized nitrogen hypoxia, an experimental procedure tried just four times before in the nation's recorded history, as a means to execute death row prisoners. Their decision came shortly after Alabama introduced the method to the public in January 2024, during the controversial and disputed execution of\u00a0Kenny Smith, whose death was described by several witnesses, including reporters, as potentially torturous.",
      "Little is understood about nitrogen hypoxia, where an inmate is made to suffocate on nitrogen gas delivered through a face mask, and Alabama was the only U.S. state prior to this week that had released a protocol for this type of execution. In addition to Alabama and, now, Louisiana, nitrogen gas executions have also been approved by legislatures in Mississippi and Oklahoma, while Ohio and Nebraska positioned themselves to follow suit after Smith was put to death.",
      "The summary of Louisiana's nitrogen gas protocol is void of details but it appears, superficially, similar to what is known about Alabama's approach.",
      "\"Execution by nitrogen hypoxia is accomplished by placing a mask on the inmate's face and replacing oxygen with nitrogen gas,\" it reads in part. \"At the designated time, pure nitrogen gas will be administered to the inmate through the mask for a sufficient time period necessary to cause the death of the inmate. In accordance with the protocol, the coroner will then be asked to confirm the death.\"",

      "\"It is unacceptable for a nominee with no current role in government, much less at the FBI, to personally direct unjustified and potentially illegal adverse employment actions against senior career FBI leadership and other dedicated, nonpartisan law enforcement officers,\" Durbin wrote.",
      "Durbin told the Justice Department IG that he had heard from his sources that Patel's directives were being carried out by top White House aide Stephen Miller, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove and members of the new FBI Director's Advisory Team. A member of the team, Durbin said his sources told him, has been providing Patel with information about what's going on inside the bureau, and that Patel \"then provides direction to Mr. Miller, who relays it to Acting Deputy Attorney General Bove.\" He claimed that each person on the DAT team communicated to bureau officials that \"at some point before January 30 that they had been in direct contact with Mr. Patel.\"",
      "DAT, Durbin said, had a list that \"identified certain officials and was seen by multiple FBI leaders.\" Those on the list were understood to be \"people in the crosshairs.\" On Jan. 29, Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll and Acting FBI Deputy Director Robert Kissane held a meeting \"where it was relayed that a group of Executive Assistant Directors (EAD) and other supervisors must resign or be fired,\" Durbin wrote.",
      "Durbin quoted \"[c]ontemporaneous notes\" from a meeting between Justice Department and FBI leadership earlier that day that said, \"KP wants movement at FBI, reciprocal actions for DOJ.\" Durbin said that Bove told people at the meeting he had \"received multiple calls\" from Miller, who was \"pressuring him\" because \"Mr. Patel wanted the FBI to remove targeted employees faster, as DOJ had already done with prosecutors.\"",

      "During his confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, Patel said he was \"not aware\" of ongoing plans to punish or fire FBI agents and personnel who had worked on the multiple investigations into Mr.\u00a0 Trump, adding, \"I don't know what's going on right now over there.\"",

      "Democrats also pressed Patel during his confirmation hearing about his promotion of the \"J6 Prison Choir,\" a list of \"deep state\" executive branch officials listed in his book, \"Government Gangsters,\" and his refusal to acknowledge Mr. Trump had lost the 2020 election.",
      "Also on Tuesday, 30 lawmakers wrote a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley and Durbin asking the committee to oppose advancing Patel's nomination because of \"inconsistencies\" in his testimony and his \"history of inflammatory statements.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:24:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson said House GOP expects to move forward on budget plan this week that lays foundation for approving Trump's agenda.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that House Republicans expect to move forward on a budget plan later this week that lays a foundation for approving President Trump's agenda, though a budget resolution has yet to be released.",
      "\"We'll be rolling out the details of that probably by tonight,\" Johnson said at a news conference Tuesday, adding that \"we are right on the schedule that we need to be on.\"",
      "Leaders in Congress have been pursuing a massive legislative package under the budget reconciliation process that would enact Mr. Trump's agenda, including resources to bolster border security, extend some of the 2017 tax cuts, incentivize domestic manufacturing and invest in American energy, while working to trim government programs and address the debt limit. But the process has faced delays amid intraparty disagreement on how to proceed. And the stalled progress in the House has prompted the Senate to move ahead with its own proposal in recent days.",
      "House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington indicated in the House Republican conference meeting earlier Tuesday that a markup of the budget resolution would be scheduled for Thursday, Johnson said.",
      "Meanwhile, the Senate Budget Committee is scheduled to mark up its budget resolution Wednesday and Thursday. The committee's chairman, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, unveiled the resolution last week.",
      "The Senate version includes border security, defense and energy priorities, leaving the tax components for a later date. Senate Republicans have generally advocated a two-bill approach, citing the complicated nature of the tax components, while House Republicans have backed a one-bill strategy to get the priorities through their divided conference.",
      "Though the Senate had for weeks deferred to the House to kickstart the reconciliation process, frustrations came to a head among Senate Republicans last week, culminating in Graham's announcement that they would proceed with their own plan.",
      "Still, Johnson has repeatedly urged the Senate to let the House lead, saying Sunday that \"at the end of the day, the House has to drive this process \u2014 and we will.\"",
      "\"I appreciate the Senate's zeal, we have it in the House as well,\" Johnson said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"But as I reminded my friend Lindsey, I have about 170 additional personalities to deal with and he's only got 53.\"",
      "Johnson, with a razor-thin GOP majority in the lower chamber, said he's made clear to Mr. Trump and his team that a one-bill strategy is essential, giving House Republicans the best chance to deliver on Mr. Trump's campaign promises. That's in part because of the difficulties posed by trying to pass two major bills under the budget reconciliation process.",
      "Using this approach, lawmakers can bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate in favor of a simple majority, which makes it easier to pass a bill in the upper chamber. But the final product can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit. And any new spending must be paid for, while the Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package to confirm that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences.",
      "The approval of a budget resolution marks the first key hurdle in the process. House Republicans had initially planned to hold a markup of the budget resolution last week, outlining a timeline to have the package on Mr. Trump's desk before May, but pushback from budget hawks for deeper spending cuts in recent weeks has slowed the process.",
      "The House Freedom Caucus, which has also advocated for a two-bill approach, released its own budget resolution Monday, which would allocate $200 billion for border security and defense, paired with $486 billion in spending cuts, and a proposed debt ceiling increase by $4 trillion.",
      "Graham told reporters at a news conference Tuesday afternoon that he spoke with Johnson at the Super Bowl and stressed that \"nothing would please me more than one big beautiful bill passed by the House that did all the things we need to do to make us prosperous and safe.\" But he said the Senate is moving forward because \"we're running out of money.\"",
      "The South Carolina Republican outlined that border czar Tom Homan and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought addressed the Senate GOP conference Tuesday and begged congressional Republicans to approve money for border security.",
      "Graham said to his GOP House colleagues, \"I wish you the best, I want one big beautiful bill, but I cannot and will not go back to South Carolina and justify not supporting the president's immigration plan. We're not building a wall, folks, we're hitting a wall. They need the money and they need it now.\"",

    "summary": "The lawsuit from more than two dozen Christian and Jewish groups contends that the new policy is spreading fear of raids, thus lowering attendance at worship services.",
    "story": [
      "More than two-dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans \u2014 ranging from the Episcopal Church and the Union for Reform Judaism to the Mennonites and Unitarian Universalists \u2014 filed a\u00a0federal court lawsuit\u00a0Tuesday challenging a Trump administration move giving immigration agents more leeway to make arrests at houses of worship.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, contends that the new policy is spreading fear of raids, thus lowering attendance at worship services and other valuable church programs. The result, says the suit, infringes on the groups' religious freedom \u2014 namely their ability to minister to migrants, including those in the United States illegally.",
      "\"We have immigrants, refugees, people who are documented and undocumented,\" said the Most Rev. Sean Rowe, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.",
      "\"We cannot worship freely if some of us are living in fear,\" he told The Associated Press. \"By joining this lawsuit, we're seeking the ability to gather and fully practice our faith, to follow Jesus' command to love our neighbors as ourselves.\"",
      "The new lawsuit echoes and expands on some of the arguments made in a similar lawsuit filed Jan. 27 by five Quaker congregations and later joined by the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and a Sikh temple. It is currently pending in U.S. District Court in Maryland.",
      "There was no immediate Trump administration response to the new lawsuit, which names the Department of Homeland Security and its immigration enforcement agencies as defendants. However, a memorandum filed Friday by the Department of Justice, opposing the thrust of the Quaker lawsuit, outlined arguments that may also apply to the new lawsuit.",
      "In essence, the memo contended that the plaintiffs' request to block the new enforcement policy is based on speculation of hypothetical future harm \u2014 and thus is insufficient grounds for issuing an injunction.",
      "The memo said that immigration enforcement affecting houses of worship had been permitted for decades, and the new policy announced in January simply said that field agents \u2014 using \"common sense\" and \"discretion\" \u2014 could now conduct such operations without pre-approval from a supervisor.",
      "One part of that memo might not apply to the new lawsuit, as it argued the Quakers and their fellow plaintiffs have no basis for seeking a nationwide injunction against the revised enforcement policy.",
      "\"Any relief in this case should be tailored solely to the named plaintiffs,\" said the DOJ memo, contending that any injunction should not apply to other religious organizations.",
      "Who are the plaintiffs in the lawsuit?",
      "The plaintiffs in the new lawsuit represent a vastly larger swath of American worshippers \u2014 including more than 1 million followers of Reform Judaism, the estimated 1.5 million Episcopalians in 6,700 congregations nationwide, nearly 1.1 million members of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and the estimated 1.5 million active members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church \u2014 the country's oldest predominantly Black denomination.",
      "Among the other plaintiffs are the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), with more than 3,000 congregations; the Church of the Brethren, with more than 780 congregations; the Convenci\u00f3n Bautista Hispana de Texas, encompassing about 1,100 Hispanic Baptist churches; the Friends General Conference, an association of regional Quaker organizations; the Mennonite Church USA, with about 50,000 members; the Unitarian Universalist Association, with more than 1,000 congregations; the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, with more than 500 U.S. congregations; and regional branches of the United Methodist Church and the United Church of Christ.",
      "\"The massive scale of the suit will be hard for them to ignore,\" said Kelsi Corkran, a lawyer with the Georgetown University Law Center's\u00a0Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection\u00a0who is lead counsel for the lawsuit.",
      "The plaintiffs joined the suit, she said, \"because their scripture, teaching, and traditions offer irrefutable unanimity on their religious obligation to embrace and serve the refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants in their midst without regard to documentation or legal status.\"",
      "Prior to the recent Trump administration change, Corkran said immigration agents generally needed a judicial warrant or other special authorization to conduct operations at houses of worship and other \"sensitive locations\" such as schools and hospitals.",
      "\"Now it's go anywhere, any time,\" she told the AP. \"Now they have broad authority to swoop in \u2014 they've made it very clear they'll get every undocumented person.\"",
      "She cited a recent incident in which a Honduran man was arrested outside his family's Atlanta-area church while a service was being held inside.",
      "The lawsuit includes details from some of the plaintiffs as to how their operations might be affected. The Union for Reform Judaism and the Mennonites, among others, said many of their synagogues and churches host on-site foodbanks, meal programs, homeless shelters and other support services for undocumented people who might now be fearful of participating.",
      "One of the plaintiffs is the Latino Christian National Network, which seeks to bring together Latino leaders with different traditions and values to collaborate on pressing social issues. The network's president is the Rev. Carlos Malav\u00e9, a pastor of two churches in Virginia, who described to the AP what network members are observing.",
      "\"There is deep-seated fear and distrust of our government,\" he said. \"People fear going to the store, they are avoiding going to church. ... The churches are increasingly doing online services because people fear for the well-being of their families.\"",
      "The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which leads the nation's largest denomination, did not join the lawsuit, though it has criticized Mr. Trump's migration crackdown. On Tuesday, Pope Francis issued a major rebuke of the deportation plan, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity and \"will end badly.\"",
      "Many conservative faith leaders and legal experts across the U.S. do not share concerns about the new arrest policy.",
      "\"Places of worship are for worship and are not sanctuaries for illegal activity or for harboring people engaged in illegal activity,\" said Mat Staver, founder of the conservative Christian legal organization Liberty Counsel.",
      "\"Fugitives or criminals are not immune from the law merely because they enter a place of worship,\" he said via email. \"This is not a matter of religious freedom. There is no right to openly violate the law and disobey law enforcement.\"",
      "Professor Cathleen Kaveny, who teaches in the theology department and law school at Boston College, questioned whether the plaintiffs would prevail with the religious freedom argument, but suggested the administration might be unwise to disregard a traditional view of houses of worship as places of sanctuary for vulnerable people.",
      "\"These buildings are different \u2014 almost like embassies,\" she said. \"I think of churches as belonging to an eternal country.\"",

      "Quincey said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that if the tariffs go into effect, making aluminum cans more expensive, the company could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "Quincey also said the impact of the new tariffs could be negligible.",
      "\"I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion dollar U.S. business, and packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure.\"",
      "Coke could also start sourcing aluminum domestically, and raise consumer prices. Quincey noted that Coke already has \"hedging programs\" in place.",
      "\"As the relative prices of different sources of ingredients and imports change, of course we look at mitigation, productivity, efficiency, adjusting where we get our materials from. All of that goes into the equation to constantly manage how this goes through,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's aim in announcing the tariffs is to protect U.S. manufacturing. \"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands. We need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "Aluminum is generally more recyclable, and less expensive than plastic. Coke has come under fire for its single-use plastic production, and late last year cut its sustainability goals. The beverage giant is now aiming to use 35% to 40% recycled material in packaging by 2035, revised down from an earlier goal of 50%.",

      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

      "The Department of Justice has charged two Russian nationals with allegedly operating a cybercrime group that used ransomware to attack hundreds of U.S. entities, making over $16 million in the process.",
      "Roman Berezhnoy, 33, and Egor Nikolaevich Glebov, 39, allegedly used ransomware software called Phobos to hack victim computer networks, copy and steal files and programs, then encrypt the original data, according to a news release from the DOJ. Once the original data was encrypted, the men and others involved in the scheme would allegedly extort the victims for ransom payments in exchange for keys that would allow the victims to access the data again.",
      "The men also allegedly threatened to expose stolen files, and allegedly operated a site on the dark web where stolen data was published. Victims of the scheme included a children's hospital, health care providers, and educational institutions, the Justice Department said. Victims lost data and money.",
      "Berezhnoy and Glebov were arrested Monday. Charges were announced Tuesday.",
      "Each has been charged with one count of wire fraud conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, three counts of causing intentional damage to protected computers, three counts of extortion in relation to damage to a protected computer, one count of transmitting a threat to impair the confidentiality of stolen data, and one count of unauthorized access and obtaining information from a protected computer.",
      "If convicted, each wire fraud-related charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Each computer damage count has a maximum penalty of 10 years. The remaining counts each have a maximum penalty of five years.",
      "The arrests come as international authorities announced a number of actions against cybercriminals. Recently, Russian national Evgenii Ptitsyn was arrested and extradited on charges related to his alleged administration of Phobos ransomware. European and German authorities also announced an operation involving the FBI and other law enforcement partners that had disrupted over 100 servers associated with the criminal network Berezhnoy and Glebov were a part of, the Department of Justice said.",

      "\"I'm a middle-class school teacher who's now in a dream world,\" Fogel said.",
      "The White House has declined to provide details about what the U.S. was giving up in the deal with Russia, and Mr. Trump also refused to say how it was reached, only calling the terms \"very fair, very reasonable.\" The president also teased that \"somebody else is being released tomorrow that you will know of.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wouldn't disclose if he spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of Fogel's release.",
      "Waltz had earlier said that Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, was leaving Russian airspace with Fogel, who was serving a 14-year sentence and was\u00a0designated as \"wrongfully detained\"\u00a0by the U.S. late last year.",
      "\"President Trump, Steve Witkoff and the president's advisors negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,\" he said in a statement. \"Since President Trump's swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States.\"",

      "His family had pushed for Mr. Trump's predecessor, former President Joe Biden, to secure his release, particularly after Fogel was left out of prisoner swaps negotiated by the previous administration. In December 2022, Russia released WNBA star Brittney Griner in a one-for-one prisoner swap for international arms dealer Viktor Bout.",
      "Then, last August, the Biden administration secured the release of three more Americans from Russia \u2014 Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich, Marine veteran\u00a0Paul Whelan\u00a0and Russian-American radio journalist\u00a0Alsu Kurmasheva\u00a0\u2014 as part of a 24-person prisoner exchange.",

This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.\"",
      "Martin De Luca and Andrew Smith, Fogel's legal team, also praised the president and his administration for their work in freeing him.",
      "\"Marc Fogel's release is historic, long overdue, and a testament to the power of strong leadership,\" they said. \"After years of bureaucratic inaction including consistent refusals to designate Marc as wrongfully detained, President Trump secured Marc's release in just a few weeks, wasting no time in taking decisive action to bring Marc home.\"",
      "Pennsylvania's senators, John Fetterman and Dave McCormick, cheered Fogel's release.",
      "\"Marc Fogel's return home is long overdue \u2014 and I know all of Pennsylvania, especially his family, will be welcoming him back with open arms,\" Fetterman, a Democrat,\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "\"I am thrilled that Marc Fogel is finally coming home after years of being wrongfully held in Russia,\" McCormick, a Republican, said in a post. \"I have been working with the administration on this since day one and I'm grateful to President Trump and Secretary Rubio for delivering on their commitment to free Marc. As I told Marc's Mom, Mafa, when we spoke in August, we had to do everything possible to get Marc home and it is a blessing that this day has finally come.\"",

The president and two others were injured, and one man was killed during the assassination attempt.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump hosted Jordan's King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday and renewed his suggestions that Gaza could be emptied of residents, controlled by the U.S. and redeveloped as a tourist area \u2014 a plan that could likely only work if the Arab nation agrees to accept more refugees.",
      "The pair met in the Oval Office, where Mr. Trump suggested he wouldn't withhold U.S. aid to Jordan, Egypt or other Arab nations, if they don't agree to dramatically increase the number of people from Gaza they take in.",
      "\"I don't have to threaten that. I do believe we're above that,\" Mr. Trump said. That contradicted his previous suggestion that holding back aid was a possibility.",
      "Abdullah was asked repeatedly about Mr. Trump's audacious plan to remake the Middle East, but didn't make substantive comments on it nor the idea that his country could accept large numbers of new refugees from Gaza. He did say that Jordan would accept roughly 2,000 children with cancer and other health problems \"right away.\" Mr. Trump said he did not know about that commitment, which he called \"a beautiful gesture.\"",
      "The president also repeated suggestions that the U.S. could come to control Gaza, but he said that it wouldn't require committing funds and would come to fruition. He also said that would be possible \"under the U.S. authority,\" without elaborating what that actually was.",
      "\"We're not going to buy anything. We're going to have it,\" Mr. Trump said of U.S. control in Gaza. He suggested that the redeveloped area could have new hotels, office buildings and houses and \"and we'll make it exciting.\"",
      "\"I can tell you about real estate. They're going to be in love with it,\" Mr. Trump, who built a New York real estate empire that catapulted him to fame, said of Gaza's residents, while also insisting that he personally would not be involved in development.",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump used the meeting to renew his suggestions that a tenuous ceasefire between Hamas and Israel could be canceled if Hamas doesn't release all of the remaining hostages it is holding by midday on Saturday.",
      "\"I don't think they're going to make the deadline, personally,\" Mr. Trump said of Hamas. \"They want to play tough guy. We'll see how tough they are.\"",
      "The king's visit is happening at a perilous moment for the ongoing ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas is accusing Israel of violating the truce and said it is pausing future releases of hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly proposed the U.S. take control of Gaza and turn it into \"the Riviera of the Middle East,\" with Palestinians in the war-torn territory pushed into neighboring nations with no right of return.",
      "His Tuesday comments contradicted his Monday suggestions that, if necessary, he would withhold U.S. funding from Jordan and Egypt \u2014 longtime U.S. allies and among the top recipients of its foreign aid \u2014 as a means of persuading them to accept additional Palestinians from Gaza.",
      "Jordan is home to more than 2 million Palestinians and, along with other Arab states, has flatly rejected Mr. Trump's plan to relocate civilians from Gaza. Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said last week that his country's opposition to Mr. Trump's idea was \"firm and unwavering.\"",
      "Besides concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily.",
      "The king is also meeting with top Trump administration officials during his visit, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He is the third foreign leader to hold an in-person meeting with Mr. Trump since his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The president announced his ideas for resettling Palestinians from Gaza and taking ownership of the territory for the U.S. during a press conference last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He initially didn't rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure Gaza but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of the territory, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan.",
      "After Mr. Trump's initial comments, Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza \"temporarily\" and sought an \"interim\" period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordnance and reconstruction.",

    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week that El Salvador's president offered to incarcerate deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including U.S. citizens, but the deal came the same day as a less-publicized offer from the United States: nuclear power.",
      "El Salvador's Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill Tinoco said a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the U.S. would help power the central American country \"at competitive pricing without depending on geopolitics or on oil prices.\"",
      "\"The experience that [the United States has] on civil nuclear energy will give us all of the tools we need to train our people, to train our Salvadoran experts, who will lead the technical and regulatory aspects of this transition \u2014 this unprecedented transition,\" Hill Tonoco said.",
      "Rubio hailed the nuclear cooperation agreement just before announcing that El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, also agreed to take deportees and incarcerated Americans from the U.S. and \"put them in his jails.\"",
      "Bukele said he would charge the United States a \"relatively low\" fee to house convicted criminals in El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a mega-prison built to hold up to 40,000 people. He said the nominal cost for America would help make \u00a0El Salvador's prison system sustainable.",
      "The nuclear agreement is a potential national security win for the United States, according to Edward Kee, who in 2022 was appointed to the Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee.",
      "\"A nuclear power plant is a hundred-year deal. If a country in Central America signed up for a Russian or Chinese reactor, this would not be good for U.S. national security in the region,\" said Kee, who founded the Washington-based Nuclear Economics Consulting Group. \"This is especially a concern because these Russian and Chinese nuclear power deals usually include broader government-to-government arrangements.\"",
      "The United States is the largest producer of nuclear energy, accounting for about 30% of the worldwide total, according to the World Nuclear Association.",
      "Proponents say nuclear energy is one the most environmentally friendly, reliable existing energy resources, but critics view it as dangerous, wasteful and expensive.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright has promised to prioritize the production of nuclear power and liquefied natural gas under the Trump administration. Investors cheered and stocks jumped when Wright, a fossil fuel company executive, was nominated.",
      "Partner countries must sign what's known as a 123 Agreement with the United States before the U.S. licenses significant exports of U.S.-origin nuclear material and equipment. At their core, the agreements are intended to advance shared nuclear nonproliferation and security objectives between the United States and its partners, the State Department said in its information page outlining these agreements.",
      "The U.S. had 25 such agreements as of Feb. 3, including with the United Kingdom, Singapore, Norway and others. El Salvador would be the first and only country from Central America in that group.",
      "El Salvador is pursuing nuclear power \u2014 signing a similar agreement with Argentina in October \u2014 at a time when the barriers that have prevented smaller countries from developing it may be receding, according to Alfonso Blanco, the former executive director of the intergovernmental Latin American Energy Organization.",
      "\"There is a significant opportunity for the revival of nuclear energy through small-scale reactors, and the technology requires demonstration sites in countries that lack developed nuclear capacities,\" said Blanco, who now works for The Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. \"This could represent a potential development path for El Salvador.\"",
      "Blanco said El Salvador and most other countries have limited options for procuring the necessary fuel for nuclear power because only eight countries have the technical capacity to enrich uranium.",
      "\"For El Salvador, positioning itself as a regional pioneer in the use of a new nuclear technology could present an interesting opportunity, especially considering that such infrastructure projects have significant spillover effects on job creation and local capacity development,\" Blanco said.",
      "But while the country's mega-prison is already built and ready to house tens of thousands of people, its nuclear plans are in their infancy.",
      "That means El Salvador is unlikely to close in on nuclear power while President Trump is in office, according to Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.",

    "summary": "President Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan says Pope Francis should \"stick to the Catholic Church,\" as the pontiff criticizes U.S. plans for mass deportations.",
    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 President Trump's U.S. \"border czar\" Tom Homan lashed out Tuesday at Pope Francis after the leader of the Catholic Church strongly criticized the mass deportation of migrants that Mr. Trump has initiated in his second term.",
      "In an open letter to U.S. Catholic bishops sent Tuesday, the Argentinian pope criticized Mr. Trump's mass deportation program, saying those who entered the United States illegally should not be treated as criminals and that the overall plan could not be supported as it violates human dignity.",
      "When asked Tuesday by a Fox News reporter to comment on the pope's \"harsh words,\" Homan replied: \"I've got harsh words for the pope: I say this as a lifelong Catholic. He ought to focus on his work and leave enforcement to us. He's got a wall around the Vatican, does he not?\"",
      "Homan reiterated that sentiment to other reporters at the White House, saying: \"I wish he'd stick to the Catholic Church and fix that and leave border enforcement to us.\"",
      "In his letter to the bishops, Francis said he was closely following the \"major crisis\" in the U.S., but that the \"rightly formed conscience cannot fail to make a critical judgment and express its disagreement with any measure that tacitly or explicitly identifies the illegal status of some migrants with criminality.\"",
      "Fury in India over U.S. deportees seen leg-chained for long flight",
      "Fury in India over U.S. deportees seen leg-chained for long flight",
      "Francis acknowledged that nations have the right to defend themselves against migrants who have committed crimes, but he said that was not incompatible with policies for orderly and legal migration.",
      "Deporting people who fled extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious environmental deterioration in their home nations, regardless of how they enter the U.S., \"damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness,\" the pope said.",
      "\"What is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly,\" Francis warned.",
      "The pope, 88, has made the defense of migrants and refugees a priority of his papacy since he was elected to lead the Catholic Church in 2013.\u00a0 Still, it is rare for a pontiff to so directly critique a country's internal political debate.",
      "The pope also rejected Vice President JD Vance's use of Catholic theology to justify the immigration crackdown.",
      "In a January 29 appearance on Fox News, Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, described what he said was \"a very Christian concept: You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country. And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.\"",
      "When critics responded that he had misunderstood the gospel, Vance took to social media to argue that a person's moral duties to their own children outweigh those, \"to a stranger who lives thousands of miles away.\"",
      "\"Just google 'ordo amoris,' Vance wrote, referring to a medieval Catholic concept on the \"order of love\" or \"order of charity\" to God, ourselves and our neighbors.",
      "While not mentioning Vance directly, Pope Francis directly contradicted the vice president's interpretation of Christian love in his Tuesday letter.",
      "\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,\" he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"",
      "Francis also urged Catholics and others to, \"not give in to narratives that discriminate and cause needless suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters.\"",
      "He said all nations' laws and policies should be crafted and considered, \"in light of the dignity of the person and his or her fundamental rights, and not vice versa.\"",
      "The pope and Mr. Trump have clashed on immigration in the past.",
      "In February 2016, asked about Mr. Trump's vow to build a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, Francis said, \"building walls instead of bridges is not Christian.\"",
      "In January, Francis called Mr. Trump's plan to conduct mass deportations of undocumented migrants a \"disgrace.\"",
      "\"It will be a disgrace,\" he said in an interview with an Italian talk show, \"because it makes the poor wretches who have nothing pay the bill\u2026 This won't do! You don't resolve things this way.\"",

    "title": "Gaza ceasefire appears in jeopardy as Trump issues Hamas an ultimatum",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 13:24:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Fear over the fate of the Gaza ceasefire spreads across the Mideast as Hamas delays the next release of Israeli hostages, Trump suggests a major change in terms.",
    "story": [
      "Families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza blocked traffic in Tel Aviv on Monday evening, panicked by Hamas saying it would delay the next scheduled release of hostages under the fragile ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to end the truce if the hostages are not returned by Saturday.",
      "\"If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end, and the IDF (Israeli military) will resume intense fighting until Hamas is decisively defeated,\" Netanyahu said in a statement after a meeting with his security cabinet.",
      "Fear over the durability of the ceasefire and hostage release agreement was spreading fast on Tuesday, after President Trump suggested the terms of the deal should be changed in the wake of Hamas' threat, and as Israel's Defense chief said he was readying troops in Gaza for a possible return to combat.",
      "The delicate halt in fighting, negotiated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, has seen five exchanges between Israel and Hamas thus far, with about half of the 33 Israeli hostages expected to be freed during the first six-week phase of the agreement now back home. More than 700 Palestinian prisoners have been released from Israeli jails in exchange.",
      "Under the terms of the agreement, a total of 33 hostages were to be released during the first six-week phase, in exchange for about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. But the families of the remaining 76 hostages \u2014 some of whom are already known to be dead \u2014 were left distraught by the developments on Monday, and by some devastating news confirmed later.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces announced Tuesday that the oldest of the remaining captives, 86-year-old Shlomo Mantzur, had been murdered in captivity. He was a survivor of the 1941 pogrom in Iraq, in which hundreds were killed in an antisemitic riot.",
      "It was with the last hostage release by Hamas, of three Israeli men on February 8, that the tone changed.",
      "Israelis were left in anguish after seeing the emaciated state the men were in, and Netanyahu's office said in a statement that, \"due to the serious condition of the three hostages and the repeated violations by the Hamas terrorist organization,\" the leader had \"instructed to not allow the situation to go unaddressed, and to take appropriate measures.\"",
      "There was no indication from Netanyahu's office over the weekend what those measures might be, but on Sunday, the IDF said in a statement that troops had \"operated to distance suspects who posed a threat to them in different areas of the Gaza Strip,\" including warning shots fired at a \"suspicious vessel\" seen offshore and a suspect seen approaching troops in the south of the enclave.",
      "The men released on Saturday, meanwhile, brought with them both welcome news, and some more distressing information. The family of hostage Alon Ohel learned that he is still alive, but that he's starving, with untreated wounds and bound in chains, according to his mother.",
      "\"Thank you for the effort you and your staff are making to bring back the hostages,\" Idit Ohel said, addressing Mr. Trump on Monday. \"Today is Alon's 24th birthday. I'm asking you with all my heart, do everything in your power to ensure that this deal is continued.\"",
      "The ceasefire agreement has also seen Israel allow hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians return to what's left of their homes in the decimated north of Gaza. But many now fear the respite could be short-lived.",
      "\"People have begun to stock up on supplies for fear that war will return,\" said Mohammad Yusuf, who lives in the badly scarred southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. \"People are afraid of any statement, from both sides.\"",
      "That fear is taking hold not just in Gaza, but in the other, much larger Palestinian territory, the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "Residents there are already reeling from an Israeli operation to uproot Hamas that the military and police launched just several days after the ceasefire in Gaza came into effect. Violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers in the territory has also been on the rise.",
      "Residents told CBS News this week that they fear President Trump's controversial plan to resettle all of Gaza's residents in other countries and \"take over\" the coastal strip of land is only the beginning.",
      "Even before Mr. Trump began his second term, his election win had already fueled discussion in Israel of the prospect of the complete annexation of the West Bank as Israeli territory.",
      "\"We will not leave our country,\" insisted West Bank resident Maha Fathi Taleb. \"We will not. Even if they shoot us. Let Trump do whatever he wants.\"",

      "Italian police arrested almost 150 people Tuesday in a major operation against the Sicilian mafia in Palermo, areas of which remain in the grip of powerful Cosa Nostra clans.",
      "Warrants were issued against a total of 183 people, 36 of whom were already in custody, for crimes including mafia-type criminal association, attempted murder, extortion, drug trafficking and illegal gambling, police said.",
      "More than 1,200 officers were involved in dawn raids, in what media reports said was the biggest operation against the Cosa Nostra since 1984.",
      "The Sicilian mafia, the inspiration for the \"Godfather\" movies, is no longer the force it once was, subject to years of crackdowns by authorities and overtaken in terms of power and wealth by Calabria's 'Ndrangheta.",
      "But Palermo police said their two-year probe had revealed how it \"continues to maintain its grip,\" these days coordinated by messages on encrypted smartphones.",
      "Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni hailed the operation, which she said \"confirms the state's constant commitment to the fight against organized crime.\"",
      "Palermo Mayor Roberto Lagalla also praised the operation, saying in a statement that the arrests \"dealt a historic blow to the mafia.\"",
      "Mafia \"exercises constant control\"",
      "Tuesday's operation was aimed at dismantling Mafia clans in several districts of the Sicilian capital Palermo and its surrounding areas, after an investigation that provides an insight into how they operate.",
      "Police described how the clans cooperated on drug trafficking -- a major source of income -- while also working with mobsters elsewhere in Sicily, and with the 'Ndrangheta on the Italian mainland.",
      "Within its territory, the mafia \"exercises constant control,\" police said.",
      "As in decades past, they demand \"pizzo\", or protection money, from businesses, and force traders to use their products, often at inflated prices.",
      "In one example, investigators revealed how a clan took control of distributing mussels and other seafood to restaurants in two seaside villages.",
      "While Cosa Nostra bosses these days try to resolve disputes peacefully to avoid attracting attention, weapons were found in Tuesday's blitz, police said, while reporting incidents of brutal beatings.",
      "The old rules of top-down organization and membership until death still hold sway but police said clan leaders were \"up to date,\" using encrypted smartphones to communicate to avoid traditional meetings.",
      "And despite numerous arrests over the years, the Sicilian mafia \"still manages to attract a large number of young people who embrace its principles\" and offer to work for them, police said. Last\u00a0 March, Italy\u00a0expanded a controversial program\u00a0to remove children from their mafia families to break the cycle of criminal behavior being passed down to new generations.",
      "The new investigation also revealed a wide network of informants, with a clerk in the Palermo prosecutors office arrested last November accused of passing on files.",
      "The Sicilian Mafia for many years terrorized the Italian public and state, notorious for the killings anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.",
      "But that led to a fierce state clampdown and the 'Ndrangheta is now considered Italy's wealthiest and most powerful mafia, which controls the bulk of cocaine flowing into Europe.",
      "Matteo Messina Denaro, the convicted mastermind of some of the Cosa Nostra  mafia's most heinous slayings, died in Sept. 2023, several months after being\u00a0captured as Italy's No. 1 fugitive\u00a0and following decades on the run.",
      "But Italy's mafia still wields influence that extends from tourism to prisons. In December, a research institute warned that Italy's mafias make more than three billion euros a year from the tourism sector. That same month, a\u00a0Catholic nun was arrested\u00a0by Italian police for allegedly bringing messages for the mafia to prisoners.",

      "Roman Berezhnoy, 33, and Egor Nikolaevich Glebov, 39, allegedly used ransomware software called Phobos to hack victim computer networks, copy and steal files and programs, then encrypt the original data, according to a news release from the DOJ. Once the original data was encrypted, the men and others involved in the scheme would allegedly extort the victims for ransom payments in exchange for keys that would allow the victims to access the data again.",
      "The men also allegedly threatened to expose stolen files, and allegedly operated a site on the dark web where stolen data was published. Victims of the scheme included a children's hospital, health care providers, and educational institutions, the Justice Department said. Victims lost data and money.",

      "Each has been charged with one count of wire fraud conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, three counts of causing intentional damage to protected computers, three counts of extortion in relation to damage to a protected computer, one count of transmitting a threat to impair the confidentiality of stolen data, and one count of unauthorized access and obtaining information from a protected computer.",

      "The arrests come as international authorities announced a number of actions against cybercriminals. Recently, Russian national Evgenii Ptitsyn was arrested and extradited on charges related to his alleged administration of Phobos ransomware.

      "Paris, France\u00a0\u2014 Vice President JD Vance, in his first international address, warned European Union countries against overregulation and said the Trump administration wants artificial intelligence to remain free from ideological bias.",
      "\"The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints,\" Vance said while speaking to world leaders and tech executives at the Artificial Intelligence Action summit in Paris, France. \"Now, America cannot and will not accept that, and we think it's a terrible mistake \u2014 not just for the United States of America \u2014 but for your own countries.\"",
      "Vance said the U.S. wants to ensure that the internet is a safe place, but suggested the European Union's Digital Services Act had gone too far, enacting \"massive regulations\" and \"policing so-called misinformation.\"",
      "\"It is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,\" Vance said.",
      "The Digital Services Act seeks to hold platforms more accountable for protecting European users from harmful or illegal content on their sites and imposes fines on violators. Last July, the EU found that the social media platform X, owned by Department of Government Effficiency head and Trump ally Elon Musk, did not comply with the act's transparency or accountability requirements.",
      "Vance told leaders, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, that excessive regulation of the AI sector could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off\" and the Trump administration will make it a priority to promote pro-growth AI policies.",
      "\"I'd like to see that deregulatory flavor making its way into a lot of the conversations at this conference,\" Vance said.",

      "\"I have a good friend on the other part of the ocean saying 'drill, baby, drill,'\" Macron said, in reference to President Trump and his push for fossil fuel energy. \"Here, there is no need to 'drill, baby, drill.' It is just 'plug, baby, plug.'\"",
      "Though the intent of the summit, which Macron is co-hosting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was to establish standards for more sustainable AI in the public interest, it has been overshadowed by the race between global powers to become the dominant country in the sector.",

      "\"I want to be clear: this administration will block such efforts, full stop,\" Vance said. \"We will safeguard American A.I. and chip technologies from theft and misuse, work with our allies and partners to strengthen and extend these protections and close pathways to advert areas attaining A.I. capabilities that threaten all of our people.\"",
      "He extended the warning to allies as well.",
      "\"I would also remind our international friends here today that partnering with such regimes, it never pays off in the long term.

      "Berlin \u2014 Many countries had their worst showing in more than a decade in an index released Tuesday that serves as a barometer of public sector corruption worldwide, from leading powers such as the United States and France to authoritarian nations such as Russia and Venezuela.",
      "Transparency International, which compiles the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, found that 47 countries out of the 180 it surveyed had their lowest score last year since it started using its current methodology for its global ranking in 2012. It said of its 2024 survey that \"global corruption levels remain alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering.\"",
      "The group also pointed to worldwide risks from corruption to efforts to combat climate change. It said a lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms increases the risk of climate funds being embezzled or misused, while \"undue influence,\" often from the private sector, obstructs the approval of ambitious policies.",
      "The organization measures the perception of public sector corruption according to 13 data sources, including the World Bank, the World Economic Forum and private risk and consulting companies. It ranks 180 countries and territories on a scale from a \"highly corrupt\" 0 to a \"very clean\" 100.",
      "The global average remained unchanged from 2023 at 43, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring under 50, Transparency International said. Denmark held onto first place with an unchanged 90 points, followed by Finland with 88 and Singapore with 84. New Zealand dropped from third to fourth, shedding two points to 83.",
      "South Sudan slid to the bottom of the index with just eight points, displacing Somalia although the latter country's score dropped to nine. They were followed by Venezuela with 10 and Syria with 12.",
      "The U.S. slid from 69 points to 65 and from 24th place to 28th. Transparency International pointed to criticism of its judicial branch. It noted that the U.S. Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023 but \"serious questions remain about the lack of meaningful, objective enforcement mechanisms and the strength of the new rules themselves.\"",
      "Other Western nations on the decline included France, which dropped four points to 67 and five places to 25th; and Germany, down three points to 75 and six places to 15th. It tied with Canada, which was down one point and three places.",

Transparency International noted that Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has \"further entrenched authoritarianism.\" It said Ukraine, while its score dipped one point to 35, \"is making strides in judicial independence and high-level corruption prosecutions.\"",
      "In the Middle East and North Africa, the situation with anti-corruption efforts \"remains bleak\" as political leaders exert near-absolute control while benefiting from wealth and clamping down on dissent, the group said. But it said \"unforeseen opportunities are also emerging\" \u2014 for example, in the wake of the fall of President Bashar Assad's government in Syria.

    "summary": "President Trump said he would give Hamas until noon Saturday to release all Israeli hostages.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump issued an ultimatum on Monday to Hamas, saying that if all remaining Israeli hostages are not released from Gaza by noon on Saturday, then \"all hell is going to break loose.\"",
      "Asked by reporters for details on what that meant, Mr. Trump initially responded: \"You'll find out, and they'll find out, too. Hamas will find out what I mean.\"",
      "He then said ending the ceasefire that took effect on January 19 would be \"Israel's decision,\" but that he felt it would be \"appropriate\" to cancel the agreement if the hostages aren't released by his deadline. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal negotiated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, a total of 33 Israeli hostages were to be released during a six-week first phase, in exchange for the release of about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.",
      "As of Monday, about three weeks into phase-one, about half of the hostages due to be released have thus far been freed, in line with the schedule laid out in the agreement. There are 76 hostages still held by Hamas or its allies in Gaza. On Tuesday, the IDF announced that the oldest one of them, 86-year-old Shlomo Mantzur, had been murdered by Hamas.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comments about the hostages while signing executive orders on Monday at the White House. He spoke hours after Hamas said it was delaying the next release of hostages, which was scheduled for Saturday, as a spokesman\u00a0accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement, including by targeting Palestinians in Gaza with airstrikes.",
      "\"This includes delays in allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, targeting them with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas of the Strip, and failing to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed,\" said Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz said Hamas' plan to delay the next release of hostages was \"a complete violation\" of the ceasefire agreement and that he had instructed the Israeli military to be on the highest level of alert. The prime minister's coordinator for hostages said the Israeli government intended to live up to its end of the agreement.",
      "But as Mr. Trump threatened to upend that agreement, he said Saturday's delayed hostage release \u2014 which was expected to see the release of another three hostages held by Hamas in exchange for dozens more Palestinian prisoners \u2014 should include all of the remaining hostages.",
      "\"I'd say they ought to  be returned by 12 o'clock on  Saturday,\" Mr. Trump said. \"All of them,  not in  drips and drabs,  not two and one and three and four and two.\"",
      "A senior Hamas leader told the French news agency AFP on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's warning over the hostages \"further complicates matters.\" It came just days after negotiations were meant to begin in earnest to lay out the terms of the second phase of the ceasefire.",
      "\"Trump must remember that there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties and this is the only way to return the prisoners (hostages),\" Sami Abu Zuhri said. \"The language of threats has no value and further complicates matters,\" he said.",
      "Separately, in part of an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier that was recorded Saturday but only released on Monday, Mr. Trump said Palestinians would not have the right to return to Gaza and he \"would own this,\" referring to his statements last week that the U.S. would \"take over\" and \"own\" the Gaza Strip and that Palestinians should not return.",
      "Israel and Hamas have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire went into effect last month, freeing 18 hostages, including Keith Siegel, who has dual U.S.-Israeli nationality, and over 730 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "The most recent exchange, which took place on Feb. 8, caused some alarm because of the emaciated condition of the three male hostages who were released by Hamas. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the three male hostages \"endured hell itself,\" after seeing the state of the men.",
      "The plan put forth by the president has drawn increasingly robust backing from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who on Monday called it \"new, creative, and revolutionary,\" but it has been roundly condemned by many nations in the region and around the world, including the neighbors of Israel to which Mr. Trump has said Gaza's population should be relocated.",

    "story": [
      "The International Boxing Association said Monday it will file criminal complaints against the International Olympic Committee in the U.S., France and Switzerland.",
      "The Swiss-based IOC allowing female boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting to compete and win gold medals in Paris last year \"may serve as grounds for criminal prosecution,\" the Russian-led IBA claimed in a statement.",
      "The IBA, a boxing body that was at the center of the 2024 Olympics controversy \u2014 partly elevated by President Trump and others who falsely claimed Khelif is transgender\u00a0\u2014 has been banished from the Games. It cited an\u00a0executive order on transgender athletes, signed by Mr. Trump last week, to justify the criminal complaints.",
      "\"According to the Swiss law, any action or inaction that poses a safety risk to competition participants warrants investigation and may serve as grounds for criminal prosecution,\" the IBA said, adding \"similar complaints are to be filed with the Attorneys General of France and the USA.\"",
      "The IBA, which has been funded by Russia state energy firm Gazprom, also promised free legal advice to female boxers to pursue cases against IOC president Thomas Bach and other senior Olympic officials.",
      "\"President Trump's order to ban transgender athletes from women's sport validates IBA's efforts to protect the integrity of female sports,\" the boxing body's president Umar Kremlev said on Monday.",
      "IBA vs. IOC an old feud",
      "The legal threats intensify a\u00a0years-long feud\u00a0between the now-exiled IBA and the IOC, and between Kremlev and Bach. The IOC took over control of running boxing tournaments at the past two Summer Games in Tokyo and Paris.",
      "The IOC said on Monday the legal tactic was \"just another example of IBA's campaign against the IOC which is ongoing since their recognition was withdrawn ... for issues related to governance, judging and refereeing as well as questions around their finances.\"",
      "The IOC has consistently said the boxers from Algeria and Taiwan, who were assigned female at birth and identify as women, complied with all the rules for the Olympic tournament. Both also competed in Tokyo in 2021 and did not win medals.",
      "Khelif and Lin were disqualified from the 2023 world championships run by the IBA, which said they failed its gender eligibility tests. IBA leadership contradicted itself about the tests and declined to answer basic questions about them, The Associated Press reported. The athletes had previously competed within the governing organization without any issues.",
      "\"The two female athletes mentioned by IBA are not transgender athletes,\" the IOC reiterated on Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump has frequently misgendered the boxers as men and last Wednesday at the White House spoke without evidence of \"two women or two people that transitioned and both of them won gold medals.\"",
      "Sports passing stricter rules",
      "Mr. Trump signed the executive order, titled\u00a0\"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\"\u00a0which aims to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "The next Summer Games are in Los Angeles in July 2028, during Mr. Trump's presidential term, and he urged the IOC last week to change everything \"having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.\"",
      "Top-tier Olympic sports track and field, swimming and cycling have already passed rules in the past three years that exclude athletes who went through male puberty from competing in women's events. World Athletics moved on Monday\u00a0toward adopting stricter rules.",
      "Tournament rules including for gender issues at Olympic boxing are broadly the same as at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, though the IOC on Monday cited career records of the two women targeted by IBA to show they have an unremarkable number of wins by referees stopping the fight.",
      "\"Such data is relevant when evaluating whether Yu-Ting and Khelif had a heightened performance advantage and/or safety risk compared to other successful boxers in the women's category,\" the IOC said.",
      "Impact on female athletes",
      "Misconceptions about Khelif's gender led to a barrage of hate and online bullying.",
      "While the boxer used it as fuel to win gold, she said the hateful rhetoric \"harms human dignity.\" Khelif's lawyer later filed a complaint in France over the\u00a0online harassment, CBS News previously reported.",
      "\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,\"\u00a0Khelif said\u00a0during an interview, in Arabic, last year. \"It can destroy people. It can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\"",

      "The president made the comment during an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier that was recorded Saturday, but the latest portion was released Monday.",
      "The president's remarks come as Israel and Hamas continue to carry out a tenuous ceasefire and hostage deal. Hamas still holds captives from its Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "\"We'll build beautiful communities for the 1.9 million people,\" the president told Baier. \"We'll build beautiful communities. Safe communities. Could be five, six. Could be two, but we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is. In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land\u2014\"",
      "Baier asked Mr. Trump, \"Would the Palestinian have the right to return?\"",
      "\"No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing, much better. In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"Because if they have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever \u2014 it's not habitable. It could be years before it could happen.\"",
      "Mr. Trump repeated his assertions that Jordan and Egypt might spend the money to resettle and house Palestinians, though both countries have so far rejected the idea. And it's not clear where the approximately 2.1 million Palestinians who live in Gaza would be housed while dwellings for them were being built elsewhere.",
      "The president's latest suggestion that he individually would own any of the land or real estate developments in Gaza under his plan is new, although the president has repeatedly suggested that Palestinians should live elsewhere. His response that Palestinians don't have the right to return is his furthest-reaching statement on the matter yet and constitutes an implicit rejection of a two-state solution.",
      "The president's words are likely to spark anger from the Palestinian community. Many have hoped the land would become an independent Palestinian state, and in the past, Mr. Trump has expressed support for a two-state solution. Israel has welcomed Mr. Trump's proposal that the U.S. take over the land, while some families of the hostages captured by Hamas have expressed fear that Mr. Trump's remarks could hinder the release of the remaining hostages.",
      "Last week, during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Trump said of Palestinians in Gaza that they should be resettled \"permanently\" in a \"beautiful area\" and \"nice homes.\" He added, \"Just can't go back. If you go back, it's gonna end up the same way it has for a hundred years.\"",
      "\"The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday. \"We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings \u2014\u00a0 level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. Do a real job. Do something different.\"",

      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 A Hamas spokesman on Monday accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement with the group, including targeting Palestinians in Gaza with airstrikes, and said that the next hostage release, scheduled for Saturday, would be delayed.",
      "Israel and Hamas are in the midst of a six-week ceasefire during which Hamas \u2014 long designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israeli governments \u2014 is releasing dozens of the hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "The sides have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire went into effect last month, freeing 18 hostages, including Keith Siegel, who has dual U.S.-Israeli nationality, and over 730 Palestinian prisoners. The next exchange was scheduled for Saturday, when three more Israeli hostages were to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, accused Israel on Monday of systematically violating the ceasefire agreement over the past three weeks, and said the Saturday release would be delayed.",
      "\"The resistance leadership has closely monitored the enemy's violations and its failure to uphold the terms of the agreement,\" Abu Ubaida said. \"This includes delays in allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, targeting them with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas of the Strip, and failing to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.\"",
      "After the most recent exchange on Feb. 8, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the three male hostages released by Hamas \"have endured hell itself,\" after seeing the state of the men, who were emaciated.",
      "\"There can be no more delays \u2014 a second stage of the hostage deal must be implemented immediately,\" the families group said.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement after the exchange that, \"due to the serious condition of the three hostages and the repeated violations by the Hamas terrorist organization,\" Netanyahu had \"instructed to not allow the situation to go unaddressed, and to take appropriate measures.\"",
      "There was no indication from Netanyahu's office over the weekend what measures would be taken.",
      "On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that troops had \"operated to distance suspects who posed a threat to them in different areas of the Gaza Strip,\" including warning shots fired at a \"suspicious vessel\" seen offshore and a suspect seen approaching troops in the south of the enclave.",
      "\"The IDF is committed to fully implementing the conditions of the agreement for the return of the hostages,\" the military said in its statement, adding that it was also \"prepared for any scenario and will continue to take any necessary actions to thwart immediate threat to IDF soldiers.\"",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire \u2014 which was brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt \u2014 have begun, but President Trump has added complexity to the situation by suggesting the U.S. could \"take over\" Gaza.",
      "The plan put forth by the American leader, which he's not backed down from, has drawn tentative backing from Netanyahu's administration but been roundly condemned by many nations in the region and around the world, including the neighbors of Israel to which Mr. Trump said Gaza's population should be relocated.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 12:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Five years ago, Lillian Achom stood with President Trump as he backed her women's development work - work she says is threatened by his USAID cut.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump and Elon Musk's attempt to gut the decades-old USAID agency is likely to end millions of dollars in U.S. funding earmarked for women's economic empowerment across the globe, including programs championed during Mr. Trump's first term by his daughter Ivanka.",
      "While Mr. Trump's bid to put virtually all of the agency's workers on leave is currently tied up in a U.S. court battle, the pause ordered by Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the end of January on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID remains in place.",
      "The Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative was intended to help 50 million women \"realize their economic potential\" by 2025, an issue the president's daughter called at the time a crucial area in which Republicans and Democrats could find common ground.",
      "Lillian Achom was a projects manager for AFCHIX, a network for women in technology, that was part of USAID's Women Connect Challenge. In 2019, she was invited to the White House to meet Ivanka Trump, who was then an advisor to her father, and to attend the W-GDP announcement.",
      "To coincide with the launch, Ivanka Trump wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed in which she said W-GDP would, \"for the first time coordinate America's commitment to one of the most undervalued resources in the developing world \u2014 the talent, ambition and genius of women.\"",
      "Achom was one of nine grantees who were invited to the White House, where President Trump signed the memorandum in the Oval House on February 7, 2019. Mr. Trump's administration pledged $50 million to W-GDP \u2014 to be allocated by USAID.",
      "Workers say Trump's aid freeze could cost even more lives in war-torn Sudan",
      "Workers say Trump's aid freeze could cost even more lives in war-torn Sudan",
      "Achom told CBS News on Monday that while the president had made supportive comments about the initiative, Ivanka \"was somebody who really cared,\" saying the president's daughter seemed genuinely concerned about women's development and economic empowerment.",
      "\"I could see that she really loves stories of our success, stories of how women are impacting communities around the globe,\" Achom said.",
      "The first Trump administration later said the program had reached 12 million women in its first year. The Biden administration continued W-GDP's work under the Gender Equity and Equality Action Fund, which invested $300 million in direct resources and another $200 million in indirect funding between 2021 and 2023, according to USAID documents provided to CBS News.",
      "Ivanka Trump did not immediately reply to a CBS News request for comment on the program or the USAID funding cuts.",
      "A State Department spokesperson, asked about the W-GDP program, noted to CBS News Rubio's review of foreign assistance programs, \"to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.\"",
      "The spokesperson said the department was \"judiciously reviewing all the waivers submitted\" by various programs and personnel in a bid to keep aid flowing, and they said the results would be communicated \"transparently.\"",
      "One of the focuses of the W-GDP program was women's access to technology, which still lags behind that of men globally. According to White House documents from the time, more than 1.7 billion women in low and middle-income countries did not own a mobile phone, and they were far less likely to use mobile internet.",
      "Rural communities in Africa have been less able to access new and emerging technologies, Achom explained, because of the cost of the internet and devices, but also because for many people, medical bills, education, and food remain the priorities.",
      "In northern Uganda, where the prevalence of HIV among women and children has historically been higher than in other parts of the country, additional USAID funding provided through the aid relief program, PEPFAR, gave communities access to ongoing supplies of antiretroviral drugs. Such support is limited from Uganda's own government because of its restrained finances, Achom said.",
      "\"USAID has really treated those in the community like their friend,\" she said. \"Like their number one friend, I should say, because they've visited them, they've given them grants, not only to support them with medical facilities and access to medicine, but to access economic empowerment.\"",
      "USAID funding was also consistent and reliable, unlike some other programs, and shutting down agency-funded programs, Achom said, will affect more than just women's access to technology.",
      "\"The ability of the entire community to move out of poverty is really going to be slowed down or compromised,\" she told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Harvard medical student and researcher Nick Norwitz recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet.",
      "Meat enthusiasts have long endorsed the \"carnivore diet,\" a meal plan that includes consuming only animal products such as meat, dairy and eggs \u2014 but the program is frowned upon by some who embrace plant-based foods like vegetables, fruits, grains and legumes.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (See the video at the top of this article, and more videos at https://www.youtube.com/@nicknorwitzPhD.)",
      "Norwitz \u2014 a self-described \"academician\" with a PhD in metabolic health, who is currently finishing his medical degree \u2014 told Fox News Digital that he's always had a passion for sharing his \"joy and interest\"\u00a0in science.",
      "RED MEAT COULD RAISE DEMENTIA RISK, RESEARCHERS CLAIM",
      "See Norwitz's eight myths below \u2014 followed by input and perspective from other health experts.",
      "Myth No. 1: There is no evidence for the carnivore diet",
      "Norwitz noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet, including a Harvard study of 2,029 participants that found \"high levels of satisfaction and improvements in overall health, well-being and various medical conditions.\"",
      "Other research that Norwitz himself conducted showed that the diet helped to alleviate inflammatory\u00a0bowel disease and restrictive eating disorders, he said.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz)",
      "While he called the results \"impressive\" and claimed that thousands of people have benefited from the carnivore diet, Norwitz noted that randomized controlled trials have not been conducted.",
      "\"These trials will need to be completed before conventional medicine can recommend a carnivore diet as a metabolic health prevention for any specific disorder,\" he says in his video.",
      "Myth No. 2: The diet increases the risk of scurvy",
      "Some claim that a carnivore diet could increase the risk of scurvy due to a vitamin C deficiency, Norwitz said.",
      "\"While it\u2019s true it's difficult to meet the RDA daily dose of 75 to 90 milligrams of vitamin C by eating only meat, there are about 25 micrograms per gram of vitamin C in fresh, grass-fed beef, so eating about 2 pounds of meat daily should give you about 18 milligrams of vitamin C.\"",
      "MEAT 'CHEAT MEALS' AMONG VEGETARIANS, VEGANS 'MORE COMMON THAN YOU MIGHT THINK'",
      "While this is still well below the recommended daily amount, Norwitz went on, \"that doesn't necessarily mean one will develop a vitamin C deficiency or the associated medical condition, which is scurvy.\"",
      "When Norwitz himself did a six-month carnivore diet experiment and then tested his vitamin C levels, he found they were normal, even bordering on being high. He explains the science behind that result in the video.",
      "Myth No. 3: Lack of fiber will cause constipation",
      "While it is true that a majority of the nutrition a person consumes on a carnivore diet will be absorbed in the small intestine, leading to an overall decline in fecal mass, \"you will still poop,\" Norwitz said in the video.",
      "\"Some studies suggest that fiber elimination can actually help manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation,\" he added.",
      "Norwitz (left) noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz/iStock)",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean fiber is bad or that long-term zero-fiber diets wouldn't have negative consequences on the microbiome, he noted.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse,\" he said. \"There are many, like me, who feel better on low- or no-fiber diets, so it's a legitimate individual choice.\"",
      "Myth No. 4: The carnivore diet will harm athletic performance",
      "Norwitz disputes this claim, noting that as the body adapts to carbohydrate restriction, the capacity to burn fat increases.",
      "\"A new study of Iron Man athletes has debunked the idea that the body needs a high intake of carbohydrates during intense exercise to maintain peak performance,\" he said.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse.\"",
      "Norwitz goes into greater detail about the association between diet and athletic performance in his video, as does another doctor.",
      "Myth No. 5: The diet will lead to heart attacks",
      "While Norwitz acknowledges that a diet rich in red meat and saturated fat can increase LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and its associated marker (ApoB), which is a risk factor for heart disease, the extent to which a carnivore diet affects those levels is \"highly individual.\"",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"Some people even see LDL cholesterol and ApoB decrease, and many don't see any change,\" he says in the video.",
      "There are many risk factors for heart disease beyond cholesterol, Norwitz noted. These include visceral fat, insulin resistance, inflammation triglycerides and HDL, all of which could actually be improved on very low-carbohydrate diets.",
      "'I WENT ON A VEGAN DIET AND MY CHOLESTEROL WENT UP \u2014 HERE'S WHY'",
      "\"So a carnivore diet does not implicitly increase heart disease risk \u2014 but the bottom line here is that different people respond differently,\" he said.",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"",
      "Myth No. 6: The carnivore diet is an eating disorder",
      "Eating disorders are defined as \"restrictive eating patterns that impair physical or mental health,\" Norwitz noted.",
      "\"So if a person cures or goes into remission from a debilitating chronic disease \u2014 be that obesity, diabetes, depression, schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 using a carnivore diet, then the diet clearly had a positive impact on physical or mental health and is not an eating disorder by definition.\"",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\" (Nick Norwitz)",
      "Instead, Norwitz said it should be considered an \"adaptive eating pattern.\"",
      "\"Not eating normally is not an eating disorder \u2014 in fact, I'd say standard American diet eating patterns could themselves reflect a form of eating disorder,\" he said.",
      "Myth No. 7: A meat-heavy diet is bad for the brain",
      "Following recent research that suggests red meat intake is linked to dementia, Norwitz said this data is \"misleading.\"",
      "The study in question lumped together different types of food, he noted, adding that there was \"tremendous healthy user bias.\"",
      "\"I do feel the carnivore diet is misunderstood, and that red meat and animal-based foods often get unfairly scapegoated.\"",
      "\"Participants who consumed more red meat had a higher prevalence of current smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes, and lower levels of dietary quality education, socioeconomic status and physical activity,\" Norwitz says in the video.",
      "Actually, he adds, \"unprocessed red meat intake was not linked to dementia or cognitive decline \u2014 just processed red meat intake, but this was somewhat overlooked in the study itself.\"",
      "Myth No. 8: The carnivore diet is for everyone",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\"",
      "The diet warrants \"further scientific exploration,\" Norwitz said.",
      "There is no \"one size fits all\" dietary solution, Norwitz said, although he noted the carnivore diet is \"misunderstood\" and \"unfairly scapegoated.\" (iStock)",
      "There is no \"one size fits all\" dietary solution, Norwitz said, adding that \"context and nuance are essential.\"",
      "\"However, I do feel the carnivore diet is misunderstood, and that red meat and animal-based foods often get unfairly scapegoated and thrown under the \u2018big food bus.\u2019\"",
      "Doctors give insight into the carnivore diet",
      "Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News' senior medical analyst, shared thoughts on the carnivore diet with Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The advantage is that meat is a high-packed source of calories from fat and a lot of protein, so it can help you lose weight,\" he said. \"But I think it is unhealthy. Too many saturated animal fats are bad for the heart and the diet is high in cholesterol.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Siegel instead recommends opting for the Mediterranean diet, which is heavy in vegetables, nuts and olive oil. \"With its unsaturated fats and antioxidants, it is much healthier,\" he said.",
      "Dr. Georgia Ede, a Harvard-trained, board-certified psychiatrist specializing in nutritional and metabolic psychiatry, said she has found carnivore diets to be \"indispensable tools\" in her clinical practice.",
      "The diet could potentially help identify food sensitivities, resolve chronic constipation and IBS symptoms, quiet food addiction and binge-eating, and break weight loss plateaus, according to Ede.",
      "\"Meat, seafood, poultry and eggs are the safest, healthiest, most nutritious foods we can eat,\" one doctor told Fox News Digital. (iStock)",
      "\"The hypothesis that meat is dangerous to human health has driven a long and passionate hunt for evidence against meat that has thus far come up empty-handed,\" the doctor, who is also the author of \"Change Your Diet, Change Your Mind,\" told Fox News Digital.",
      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0www.foxnews.com/health",
      "\"In my research, I have yet to find a credible, plausible health argument against including meat of any kind, red or otherwise, in the human diet,\" she went on.",
      "\"Meat, seafood, poultry and eggs are the safest, healthiest, most nutritious foods we can eat.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern \u2026 is ideal for everyone.\"",
      "Ede added, \"It\u2019s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern (or any dietary pattern, for that matter) is ideal for everyone, but my clinical and personal experience tell me that a well-formulated carnivore diet can be uniquely healing for some of us.\"",

      "The doctor did acknowledge that adhering to carnivore diets poses potential challenges.",
      "\"These include the potential for boredom that can come from the relative lack of variety, the social challenges of eating in a way that may make others feel uncomfortable, and the logistical challenges of finding meat, seafood, poultry, and/or egg dishes prepared simply enough to be suitable for the diet, especially when traveling or eating at others\u2019 homes,\" she told Fox News Digital.",

      "Luttrell's legislation is a companion to a bill introduced in the Senate by senators Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and aims to prevent further trafficking of migrant children by implementing proper vetting for adults who sponsor a child in the United States, including vetting for parents, immediate relatives and unrelated adults.",

      "\"It is terrifying to think that over 300,000 young, innocent children have been brought into this nation, potentially forced into unsafe conditions and at risk for human trafficking,\" Scott said in the release. \"As a parent or grandparent, it\u2019s unimaginable to think what might happen to these children and that former President Joe Biden allowed this to happen by completely dismantling our immigration system and opening our southern border, completely ignoring the consequences or the tolls on human life.\"",

      "While astronomers have known about the galaxy where the phenomenon was captured for over a century, they were surprised when Euclid revealed the bright glowing ring,",
      "Euclid blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida on July 1, 2023, to begin a six-year mission to explore the dark universe.",
      "GIANT STELLAR NURSERY REVEALED IN NEW IMAGES FROM ESA'S SPACE TELESCOPE",
      "A sea of colorful stars and galaxies appear to swim in the vast blackness of space around a hazy halo at center stage. In the middle of the image, the fuzzy-looking bulb of light in a warm shade of yellow extends around a small bright spot, nestled within a thin light circle that appears to be drawn closely around it. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "But before the space telescope could begin its survey of the universe, scientists had to ensure everything onboard was working properly. During the early phase of testing, which took place in September 2023, Euclid sent images back to Earth.",
      "The ESA said the images were deliberately out of focus, but in one of the images, Euclid Archive Scientist Bruno Altieri saw what he believed was a very special phenomenon and decided to look at it a bit closer.",
      "\"I look at the data from Euclid as it comes in,\" Bruno said in a press release from the ESA. \"Even from that first observation, I could see it, but after Euclid made more observations of the area, we could see a perfect Einstein ring. For me, with a lifelong interest in gravitational lensing, that was amazing.\"",
      "For most of the population out there, an Einstein Ring is an \"extremely rare phenomenon,\" the ESA said.",

      "A thin ring of a perfect circular shape and a piercingly bright white disc in its middle are the protagonists of this image. They stand out against a uniformly colored background of a hazy dark gray. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "When a distant galaxy is observed through a telescope, the light from that galaxy may encounter another galaxy on its way to the telescope. When that happens, the foreground galaxy acts like a magnifying glass, and gravity causes the traveling light rays to bend. When light rays bend, scientists call that gravitational lensing, according to the ESA.",
      "When the background galaxy, lensing galaxy and telescope are in perfect alignment, the image appears as a ring, also known as an Einstein Ring.",
      "The galaxy, called NGC 6506, is about 590 million light-years away, and this is the first time the ring of light around its center has ever been detected.",
      "\"All strong lenses are special, because they're so rare, and they're incredibly useful scientifically,\" Conor O\u2019Riordan of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics said. \"This one is particularly special, because it\u2019s so close to Earth and the alignment makes it very beautiful.\"",
      "POWERFUL WEBB TELESCOPE CAPTURES PHOTOS OF ONE OF THE EARLIEST SUPERNOVA EVER SEEN",
      "The text paragraph explains the principle behind the Einstein rings. (ESA)",
      "Einstein rings are based on physicist Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, which predicts that light will bend around objects in space, so they focus the light like giant lenses, ESA said. The phenomenon allows scientists to sometimes see the light from distant galaxies that would otherwise be hidden.",
      "\"I find it very intriguing that this ring was observed within a well-known galaxy, which was first discovered in 1884,\" Valeria Pettorino, ESA Euclid project scientist, said. \"The galaxy has been known to astronomers for a very long time. And yet this ring was never observed before. This demonstrates how powerful Euclid is, finding new things even in places we thought we knew well. This discovery is very encouraging for the future of the Euclid mission and demonstrates its fantastic capabilities.\"",
      "Over the course of the mission, scientists expect Euclid will reveal more about the role of gravity in the Universe, as well as the nature of dark energy and dark matter.",

      "Euclid will map over a third of the sky and observe billions of galaxies as far as 10 billion light-years away, ESA said. In doing so, scientists expect Euclid to find around 100,000 more strong lenses, though finding one so cosmically close to home and so spectacular, ESA added, \"is astonishing.\"",

      "If there is one corporation that is targeted by scammers more than anyone else, it is Microsoft. From customer support scams to impersonation and phishing attacks, the company\u2019s services are constantly under threat. Recently, even Russia-sponsored hackers managed to breach Microsoft and steal sensitive information.",
      "While Microsoft services as a whole are prime targets, one that stands out is Teams. The collaboration tool is used by more than 300 million people worldwide, making it a goldmine for attackers. Hackers are using it to spread\u00a0phishing,\u00a0vishing and\u00a0quishing campaigns, relying on social engineering tactics to trick victims into sharing private and sensitive data.",

      "The rising attacks on Microsoft Teams users",
      "Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting Microsoft Teams users with\u00a0sophisticated attack methods. One such technique involves malicious GIF images that exploit worm-like vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to take over accounts and infiltrate chat sessions when the image is opened.",
      "Hackers also insert malware-laden files into chat threads, tricking users into downloading DLL files that enable system takeover. Phishing campaigns leverage compromised accounts or domains to send deceptive invitations, luring victims into downloading harmful files.",
      "Some attackers use email bombing and vishing, posing as tech support to overwhelm users with spam emails before tricking them into granting remote access. Compromised email addresses and stolen Microsoft 365 credentials provide another entry point for unauthorized access.",
      "Plus, external access settings in Microsoft Teams, which often allow outside users to initiate chats or meetings, can be exploited if not properly restricted. Another common tactic is sending phishing links through Teams chats, often disguised as invoices or payment notifications, leading to ransomware infections.",

      "Scammers have been running fake job schemes for a while, but their tactics keep evolving. Lately, I reported how\u00a0fake job emails are being used to install crypto mining software that slows down computers. Now, they are using Microsoft Teams chat to trick people.",
      "It usually starts with an email about a job followed by a suggestion to do the interview over Teams. The first red flag is that the entire interview happens over chat with no video and no call. After that, you are \"hired\" and asked to submit your details, often through a Google Doc requesting personal info like your social security or tax number. Some victims are even asked to buy equipment for the job, pay a hiring fee or purchase gift cards, which are classic signs that the whole thing is a scam.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from scammers targeting Microsoft Teams",
      "1) Avoid opening suspicious links and attachments: Be cautious of unsolicited links or attachments, especially in chat messages or emails. Cybercriminals often use these to deliver malware or phishing links. Never click on links that seem unusual or come from unknown sources.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Check for red flags in job offers: If you receive a job offer that seems too good to be true or involves an interview conducted entirely via chat with no phone call or video meeting, it's likely a scam. Legitimate companies typically conduct interviews using multiple forms of communication.",
      "A job offer that insists on only text-based conversations is a major red flag. Other warning signs include being asked to provide personal information through Google Docs, being asked to pay for equipment, paying fees to secure the job or purchasing gift cards as part of the hiring process.",
      "3) Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure your Microsoft 365 and other accounts are protected with strong passwords. Consider using\u00a0two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. Also, you might want to use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive personal details, like social security numbers or tax information, through unsecured or unsolicited channels, such as Google Docs or messages on Teams. Always verify the legitimacy of such requests.",
      "5) Report suspicious activity: If you notice any suspicious activity on your Microsoft Teams account or receive unusual job offers, report it immediately. Prompt action can prevent a potential breach or further compromise. Notify your IT department or relevant authorities so they can investigate and take appropriate measures.",
      "6) Verify IT support requests: Be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls claiming to be from IT support, especially those asking you to install software or grant remote access. Cybercriminals often impersonate IT staff to deploy ransomware or steal sensitive data. Always verify such requests with your actual IT department before taking any action. If in doubt, contact your IT team directly using official channels, not through the message or call you received.",
      "ENERGY-SAVING SCAM USES ELON MUSK\u2019S NAME \u2013 HERE\u2019S THE TRUTH",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers and hackers are not slowing down, so staying sharp is the only way to stay ahead. If something feels off, like a job that sounds too good to be true, a random Teams message with a sketchy link or an interview that is just a chat, trust your instincts. You should always be careful with external messages and invites that you to receive on Microsoft Teams. Even if it seems like it is from someone you know, it is best to double-check, especially if it involves a file, a link or an invitation to a chat you were not expecting to receive.",

      "4. Avoid signing in with Google or Facebook:\u00a0Many websites offer login options using Google or Facebook. While convenient, this shares even more data with these platforms. Instead, create separate accounts using email whenever possible.",
      "5. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and private browsing mode:\u00a0A\u00a0VPN hides your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity, making it harder for websites to track you. Combined with private browsing or incognito mode, this reduces the amount of data companies can collect about your online activity. Using a VPN service can also enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi.",

      "The best way to reduce companies from collecting your data is to remove invasive apps from your phone. Many apps request unnecessary permissions that can track your activity, so deleting them limits exposure. Instead of downloading standalone apps, try using the browser versions of popular social media platforms, as they typically have fewer permissions.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "However, web tracking still exists through cookies and fingerprinting, so using a\u00a0privacy-focused browser like Brave, Firefox with enhanced tracking protection, or Safari with Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) can further reduce data collection. However, some apps are so deeply integrated that replacing them is difficult. For example, if you use an Android phone, avoiding Google\u2019s ecosystem is nearly impossible. Apple, on the other hand, offers more privacy controls, giving users better options to limit data collection.",

      "The healthcare industry has recently been a major target for hackers. You might remember the 2024 Ascension attack, which led to significant disruptions.",
      "The Change Healthcare breach was also on a massive scale. UnitedHealth initially\u00a0claimed that 100 million Americans were affected, but later\u00a0raised that number to 190 million.",
      "There have been countless other incidents, and now you can add another to the list. Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC), a Connecticut-based federally qualified health center, has disclosed a data breach following a criminal cyberattack on its systems.",

      "What You Need to Know",
      "Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC)\u00a0detected a data breach on Jan. 2 after identifying unusual activity within its computer systems. An investigation confirmed that a skilled hacker had accessed and extracted data but did not delete or lock any information. If CHC's claims are accurate, this is a positive outcome, as hackers often deploy ransomware, a type of attack in which they lock systems and demand payment before restoring access.",
      "In a\u00a0regulatory filing with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s Office, CHC said that 1,060,936 people were affected by the data breach. The type of information compromised varies depending on an individual\u2019s relationship with CHC. Patient data that may have been accessed includes names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, diagnoses, treatment details, test results, Social Security numbers and health insurance information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "For individuals who are not regular CHC patients but received COVID-19 services at a CHC clinic, the breached data may include names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, addresses, gender, race, ethnicity and insurance details if provided. Additional information, such as test dates, results and vaccine details, including type, dose and administration date, may also have been affected. In rare cases, Social Security numbers were also included in the breach.",
      "The organization did not disclose how the hackers gained access to the data or whether proper cybersecurity measures were in place at the time of the breach. While CHC has assured that its systems are no longer at risk, the same cannot be said for its patients, who may now be targets of various cyberattacks.",

The organization said there is no evidence at this time that the compromised data has been misused.",

      "6 ways to protect yourself from Change Healthcare data breach",
      "1. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0The breach has exposed sensitive personal data, making it essential to reduce your online footprint. While no service can guarantee complete data removal, a reputable data removal service can significantly limit your exposure. These services systematically monitor and erase your personal information from numerous websites and data brokers.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With addresses among the compromised data, scammers may exploit this breach to send fraudulent letters. Be aware of mail claiming\u00a0missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Always verify the authenticity of such communications before responding or taking action.",
      "3. Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Scammers may use your compromised email or phone number to target you with\u00a0phishing attacks. Be wary of messages asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. To protect yourself, ensure strong antivirus software is installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, regular monitoring of your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts is critical. Look for unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity, and report any issues immediately to your bank or credit card provider.",
      "5. Recognize and report a Social Security scam:\u00a0If your Social Security number is exposed, you could become a target for related scams. Official communication regarding Social Security issues usually comes via mail, not phone calls or emails. Learn more about spotting and reporting scams by visiting the Social Security Administration\u2019s\u00a0scam information page.",
      "6. Invest in identity theft protection: Data breaches happen every day, and most never make the headlines, but with an identity theft protection service, you\u2019ll be notified if and when you are affected. An identity theft protection service can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The CHC breach may not be as large as the UnitedHealth attack, but with over a million individuals affected, it\u2019s still a serious incident. Cybercriminals can exploit stolen data in various ways, from identity theft to targeted phishing scams. While CHC has taken steps to secure its systems, those impacted should remain vigilant. Be wary of unexpected emails, calls or messages requesting personal information, and consider monitoring financial and medical accounts for any suspicious activity.",

      "Scientists from Germany's universities of Stuttgart and Freiburg have developed what is known as the\u00a0Solar Gate window facade system. It's like having tiny pinecones built right into your windows. These smart windows have special elements that curl up when it's cool and moist, letting in sunlight to warm your home. But when it's hot and dry, they flatten out to block the sun and keep things cool inside.",

      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How it works",
      "The Solar Gate system consists of a gridded array of pine-cone-scale-inspired self-bending elements housed between two panes of glass in an aluminum-frame window unit. Each element is ingeniously crafted with three distinct layers, each serving a unique purpose. The bottom layer is composed of a cellulose powder and a thermoplastic blend that swells when exposed to moisture. Above this lies a middle layer made of thermoplastic, which remains unaffected by moisture.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The top layer consists of flexible biocomposite filaments that serve to hold the entire structure together. When exposed to moist air, the bottom layer expands, causing the element to curl upwards. Conversely, in dry conditions, it returns to its flattened state. This simple yet effective mechanism allows the window to respond automatically to changing weather conditions, providing optimal shading and light penetration as needed.",

In a comprehensive year-long study, researchers installed 424 Solar Gate elements in the south-facing skylight of a research building at the University of Freiburg. The results of this extensive trial were nothing short of impressive.",
      "During the cool, wet winter months, the elements responded by curling upwards, allowing ample sunlight to penetrate the building. This natural response effectively warmed and illuminated the interior spaces, reducing the need for artificial heating and lighting. Conversely, as the seasons changed and brought warmer, drier summer conditions, the elements automatically flattened out.",
      "This flattening action served to block excess sunlight, effectively keeping the building's interior cool and comfortable without the need for energy-intensive air conditioning. The test demonstrated the system's ability to autonomously adapt to changing weather conditions, providing optimal comfort and energy efficiency throughout the year.",

For instance, studies have investigated the development of shading systems using wooden slats that can open and close in response to environmental conditions.",
      "In the realm of textiles, scientists are working on \"smart\" clothing fabrics that can adapt to ambient temperature, providing optimal comfort for wearers. Perhaps most intriguingly, these principles are even being applied to the field of robotics, with researchers developing tiny mobile robots that can respond to environmental stimuli in ways inspired by natural mechanisms.

      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "In its ruling Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that the \"defendants do not cite any authority in support of their administrative stay request or identify any harm related to a specific funding action or actions that they will face without their requested administrative stay.\"",
      "The Justice Department had sought two different kinds of pauses of U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell's restraining order barring the government from continuing to implement its sweeping freeze of funding and another ruling that found that government had violated the order. Lawyers for the Justice Department contended in part that McConnell's order was vague, but the appeals court suggested they should be patient.",
      "\"We are confident the District Court will act with dispatch to provide any clarification needed with respect to, among other things, the defendants' contention that the February 10 Order 'bars both the President and much of the Federal Government from exercising their own lawful authorities to withhold funding without the prior approval of the district court,'\" the appeals court wrote Tuesday.",
      "It said both sides should submit further arguments on the government's request for a stay pending a full appeal by Thursday. The administration has asked the appeals court to rule on the full stay request by Friday.",
      "\u201cThese unlawful injunctions are a continuation of the weaponization of justice against President Trump. The White House will continue to fight these battles in court, and we expect to be vindicated,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.",

It was later rescinded, but Leavitt said the same day that the underlying funding freeze was still in effect.",
      "Judge McConnell granted the states' request for a temporary restraining order on Jan. 31 in a ruling finding the states \u201care likely to succeed on the merits of some, if not all, their claims\u201d that the funding freeze exceeded the president's powers.",

      "The states later contended that some of the funding was still frozen, leading McConnell to issue an order Monday directing the government to comply with his order. He also pushed back against the government's assertion that his order was vague.",
      "McConnell wrote that the order lifting the freeze had been \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d and that the states had \u201cpresented evidence in this motion that the Defendants in some cases have continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to resume disbursement of appropriated federal funds.\u201d",
      "The \"pauses in funding violate the plain text\" of the order, he wrote, directing that the funding be immediately restored.",
      "It was the first time since Trump\u2019s second inauguration that a federal judge has accused his administration of defying a court order, and it comes as his administration has hit numerous roadblocks enacting parts of his agenda because of legal challenges.",

      "Trump, who has a history of publicly blasting judges who have ruled against him, said Tuesday he would listen to the courts. \u201cI always abide by the courts, and then I\u2019ll have to appeal it,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.",

    "summary": "Sen. Dick Durbin accused Kash Patel, President Trump's pick for FBI director, of secretly orchestrating the firings of FBI officials.",
    "story": [
      "The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee has sent a letter to the Justice Department Inspector General accusing Kash Patel, President Trump's pick for FBI director, of secretly orchestrating the firings of FBI officials, a day after telling the committee under oath that he was not aware of any plan to do so.",
      "\u201cIf these allegations are true, Mr. Patel may have perjured himself before the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., wrote.",
      "Durbin said\u00a0he has spoken\u00a0to whistleblowers who\u00a0told him that\u00a0Patel has been\u00a0relaying\u00a0instructions to White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, who then relayed Patel's instructions to acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove.",
      "\u201cI have received highly credible information from multiple sources that Kash Patel has been personally directing the ongoing purge of career civil servants at the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\u201d Durbin wrote in the letter. \u201cAlthough Mr. Patel is President Trump\u2019s nominee to be FBI Director, he is still a private citizen with no role in government.\u201d",
      "Durbin, whose letter was first reported by The New York Times, described a meeting the day before Patel's confirmation hearing where Bove said Patel and Miller were pushing for firings at the FBI, as had already occurred at the Department of Justice.",
      "\"Contemporaneous notes from that morning meeting read: 'KP wants movement at FBI, reciprocal actions for DOJ,'\u201d Durbin wrote, an apparent reference to Patel's initials.",
      "In a social media post, Erika Knight, a spokesperson for Patel, did not directly address Durbin's letter but decried what she described as a \"false narrative.\"",
      "\u201cKash Patel is a highly qualified national security expert who has been fully transparent with the American people throughout this process and has demonstrated the integrity and leadership needed for this role,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe Senate should confirm him without delay.\u201d",
      "Durbin noted\u00a0that, during Patel's confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J.,  asked Patel if he was \"aware of any plans or discussions to punish in any way, including termination, FBI agents or personnel associated with Trump investigations? Yes or no.\u201d",
      "Patel answered that he was \u201cnot aware of that.\u201d\u00a0Patel then added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on right now over there, but I\u2019m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues that I will honor the internal review process of the FBI.\u201d",
      "Patel also stated in the hearing, \u201cAll FBI employees will be protected against political retribution.\u201d",
      "The following day,\u00a0acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll sent a memo to the entire FBI workforce saying that he had been ordered to remove eight senior FBI executives by Bove, who previously worked as Trump's defense lawyer. Driscoll also said he was told to turn over the names of every FBI employee involved in investigating Jan. 6 rioters, a number believed to be in the thousands.",
      "Driscoll refused a Justice Department order that he assist in the firing of agents involved in Jan. 6 riot cases, pushing back so forcefully that some FBI officials feared he would be dismissed, multiple current and former FBI officials previously told NBC News.",
      "Continued fears of mass firings",
      "The Trump administration has also asked the FBI's field offices and headquarters to justify the continued employment of 3,600 bureau employees \u2014 roughly 10% of the FBI\u2019s workforce \u2014 who joined the bureau recently and as a result are on probationary status.",
      "The FBI Agents Association, a group that represents agents but is not a union, said that special agents on probation have already undergone extensive training at the FBI Academy in Quantico. They say the agents are already working on active investigations and mass dismissals could disrupt them.",
      "In an interview with NBC News Tuesday, Natalie Bara, the president of the FBI Agents Association, said that it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to train an agent, from their initial application to their graduation from Quantico.",
      "Bara said the bureau needs to add 800 to 1,000 special agents each year to replace retiring special agents, so mass firings would impact the bureau for years.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to turn around and fire or dismiss agents who have already been through this process,\" Bara said.",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Patel's nomination on Thursday. It's unclear whether Durbin's perjury claim will have an impact on Republican senators, who have so far uniformly defended Patel.",
      "If his nomination is approved by the committee, the full Senate will vote on whether to confirm Patel to a 10-year-term as FBI director."

      "The NCAA\u2019s policy change came the day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week barring trans girls and women from competing in female sports. The order threatens to revoke federal funding from schools that don\u2019t comply. The order does not bar trans boys and men from playing on male sports teams, and the department\u2019s letter to the NCAA and NFHS does not mention reversing awards won by trans men.",
      "The Education Department\u2019s release Tuesday quoted Riley Gaines, a former swimmer for the University of Kentucky who now advocates against including trans women in women\u2019s sports. In 2022, Gaines, a 12-time NCAA All American, tied for fifth with Lia Thomas, a trans woman who swam for the University of Pennsylvania, in the women\u2019s 200-meter NCAA championships. That same year, Thomas became the first trans woman to win an NCAA championship when she won the 500-yard freestyle.",

Restoring stolen athletic accolades to their rightful owners is a crucial step towards reinstating accountability, integrity, and common sense \u2014 one that I wholeheartedly support.\u201d",
      "More than 500,000 student-athletes compete in NCAA championship sports, according to the association. While it\u2019s unclear how many are transgender, NCAA President Charlie Baker told a Senate committee in December that he is aware of fewer than 10.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 23:37:58 GMT",
    "summary": "New variants of bird flu are turning up in dairy cattle. But some states still aren't a part of a federal milk supply testing program",
    "story": [
      "Three of America\u2019s top milk-producing states aren\u2019t a part of federal surveillance testing for bird flu even as a new variant is turning up in dairy cattle, in what some public health experts say is a troubling gap in the national effort to identify and detect the spread of the virus.",
      "The U.S. Agriculture Department started a voluntary milk-testing program in December after the virus was found to have jumped to cattle in March. The recent outbreak of avian influenza in the United States was first detected in 2022, but has picked up steam over the last year, decimating poultry farms nationwide, killing tens of millions of birds and driving up the price of eggs.",
      "While the risk to humans remains low, many public and animal health experts argue that broad, nationwide testing of milk is critical to containing virus cases that might otherwise go undetected, giving the variants more opportunities to spread to animals \u2014 and to humans.",
      "\u201cIt is incredibly difficult to control a disease of national importance unless we have a robust surveillance system in place,\u201d said Dr. K. Fred Gingrich II, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, which represents cow veterinarians.",
      "\u201cIf we were testing every dairy, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d have any cases slipping through the cracks.\u201d",
      "Yet Texas, Wisconsin and Idaho, three of the country\u2019s top five milk-producing states, aren\u2019t participating in the voluntary federal testing program. And though efforts are underway to get them on board, it\u2019s not clear when they will join or how long it will take.",
      "Texas had the first known case of bird flu in cattle, the first person believed to be infected by a mammal, and a case in dairy cattle as recently as December. But the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, Sid Miller, said surveillance milk testing was unnecessary, since there are currently no active cases of bird flu in the state\u2019s commercial cattle or poultry.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, if you measure by how many herds are affected,\u201d Miller said in an interview.",
      "Requiring milk testing for bird flu would be \u201cjust more regulation, more cost, more oversight. It\u2019s not necessary,\u201d he said, adding that the state still considered bird flu to be a significant threat but that bovine vaccine development should be a major focus.",
      "A separate agency, the state\u2019s Animal Health Commission, is working with federal officials to develop a surveillance testing program for bird flu, according to the USDA.",
      "Just last week, the USDA announced it had discovered a new strain in cattle, caught in Nevada through the federal milk-testing program.",
      "The detection \u201cis a testament to the strength of our \u202fNational Milk Testing Strategy,\u201d the USDA said in a statement to NBC News. The agency said last month that testing samples are being taken from nearly three-quarters of the country\u2019s milk production. More states have come on board since then, with nearly 40 now participating. The USDA is aiming to enroll all 48 continental states.",
      "One person has died and at least 68 people have been infected in the United States since the beginning of 2024, most often after close or prolonged contact with infected animals, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Richard Webby, an animal influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said the milk testing is a critical tool for helping disease specialists monitor how the virus is evolving, especially in ways that could make it easier to transmit from person to person.",
      "\u201cWe can figure out if there are changes that are occurring in the virus that increase human risk,\" he said.",
      "Pasteurization effectively kills bird flu that is found in milk, rendering it safe to drink, though farmworkers are still coming into contact with raw milk and cattle that could be infected. More than 960 dairy herds nationwide have been affected so far, and the federal government requires all lactating dairy cattle to be tested for bird flu before being moved across state lines.",
      "The testing is carried out by state and USDA officials, using raw milk samples from bulk silos, where milk from farms is collected before it\u2019s sent to processors that pasteurize, homogenize and package it. The USDA has a national network of labs for bird flu testing, and the federal program requires a minimum of four testing rounds over six months, with follow-up testing that aims to trace any positive results back to individual farms. The agency also provides free testing to individual farmers.",
      "Wisconsin said it \u201ccontinues to work toward\u201d enrolling in the USDA\u2019s testing program and is working closely with state and federal partners to monitor bird flu developments, according to a spokesperson for the state agriculture department.",
      "Idaho did not respond to requests for comment but is not currently participating in the program, according to the USDA.",
      "Bird flu, like many viruses, can often be detected through testing days before dairy cows exhibit any symptoms, health experts said, which can help farmers quickly take steps to contain the virus, quarantine affected animals and test humans who were potentially exposed.",
      "\u201cThe more lead time we have in identifying where the virus is \u2014 that allows us to bolster the protection for the workers as well,\u201d said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who helped identify the first confirmed case of bird flu in cattle last year.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re flying blind in a particular state, where we don\u2019t know what the status is, we really can\u2019t say for certain what the risk is,\u201d Russo added.",
      "The frequency of milk testing varies widely across the United States, even within the states enrolled in the USDA program.",
      "While testing occurs monthly in some states, after outbreaks in dairy cattle last year, Colorado required all farms to conduct weekly milk testing to help contain the disease, which has continued.",
      "\u201cIt helps our poultry and dairy industries sleep at night,\u201d said Dr. Maggie Baldwin, Colorado\u2019s state veterinarian, who said that the state\u2019s testing regime helped detect cases before animals displayed symptoms. \u201cWe know where it is and where it isn\u2019t.\u201d"

      "More than three years before a Louisiana woman was arrested last week in the death of a TV reporter in New Orleans to cover the Super Bowl, a man visiting the city from out of state accused the woman, Danette Colbert, of drugging him, robbing his savings and leaving him for dead.",
      "Colbert, 48, was convicted in October of computer fraud, theft and illegal transmission of monetary funds, and David Butler said in a victim impact statement he shared with NBC News that her \u201ccontinued disregard for others\u201d should have resulted in a maximum prison sentence.",
      "The judge suspended a combined sentence under which she would have spent years behind bars and instead ordered Colbert to pay restitution and remain on probation for five years, court records show.",
      "\u201cHad the court acted decisively by incarcerating Ms. Colbert or enforcing stricter conditions for her release, it is possible Mr. Manzano would still be alive today,\u201d Butler said about Telemundo reporter Adan Manzano, 27, who was found dead in his hotel room last week.",
      "A spokesperson for Orleans Criminal District Judge Nandi Campbell, who presided over Butler\u2019s case, said Campbell could not comment and referred NBC News to Butler\u2019s victim impact statement, which was read into the record in November.",
      "Lawyers for Colbert in both cases did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did a spokesperson for the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Court records show the prosecutor in Butler's case filed a motion Monday to revoke Colbert's probation.",
      "Similar accounts reported after death",
      "Colbert has been charged with fraud and other theft-related crimes in connection with Manzano\u2019s death. Police in Kenner, west of New Orleans, said in a statement Monday that investigators uncovered additional evidence and are working with forensic experts and the coroner\u2019s office to determine whether Colbert should be charged with additional crimes.",
      "Results from a toxicology test could take weeks, authorities said.",
      "Since the announcement of Colbert\u2019s arrest last week, people claiming to be victims of Colbert or reporting deaths similar to Manzano\u2019s have reached out to the police department, according to the statement.",
      "In Nevada, court records in two cases show Colbert was charged in 2022 with grand larceny and administering a drug to aid in the commission of a felony. Both cases were dismissed after the victims said they did not want to testify in court, The Associated Press reported.",
      "In Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, Colbert pleaded guilty to fraud in 2019 after authorities accused her of accessing a man\u2019s device and stealing more than $1,000, court records show. In the same parish two years before, Colbert pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud in a similar case.",
      "\u2018I knew she wouldn\u2019t stop\u2019",
      "Butler, 52, who did not want to share his location for privacy reasons, said he was among those who reached out to the Kenner Police Department after he learned of Manzano\u2019s death. He had been regularly monitoring Colbert online since 2021, he said, \u201cbecause I knew she wouldn\u2019t stop.\u201d",
      "In November of that year, Butler encountered Colbert while he was in New Orleans renovating a property he owns. After a long day of work, Butler said, he was going out to a French Quarter bar when Colbert and another woman approached him and asked whether he wanted a drink. He agreed, he said, and after he briefly stepped away from their table, he returned, finished his cocktail and quickly started to feel disoriented.",
      "Butler said he took Colbert up on an offer to help him get home.",
      "\u201cShe ushered me into some kind of black Suburban that was literally right there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the last thing I remember that night.\u201d",
      "Butler said he came to hours later on a mattress on the floor of the home he was renovating. He said that had no idea how he got there and that his property manager had to repeatedly yell and shake him to wake him.",
      "Butler soon discovered that his phone and wallet were gone, he said. The device\u2019s \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d feature had been shut off, he said, and his credit cards had been used to charge thousands of dollars at stores like Best Buy and Walmart. More than $80,000 that he had stashed away for retirement in a cryptocurrency account was also gone, he said.",
      "Months later, when New Orleans police put out a poster identifying Colbert as a suspect in the case, the police department said she was wanted for the theft of more than $134,000.",
      "\u201cThe ordeal,\u201d Butler later said in his victim impact statement, \u201cdevastated my life.\u201d",
      "Butler said he did not go to the hospital and does not know what his drink was allegedly spiked with. He regrets that decision, but he said that at the time, he was focused on trying to figure out who had stolen his things.",
      "Butler said he was able to help identify Colbert through the theft of his crypto savings. He searched the unique identifier associated with the account his money had been transferred to \u2014 \u201cQueenTX100\u201d \u2014 and came across Colbert\u2019s Facebook page, which uses the same name and included a photo of the woman he had met in the French Quarter.",
      "Butler provided those details to police, he said in an interview. His account and allegations track with his victim impact statement that was read in court.",
      "A police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and the police department did not immediately respond to a public records request for the case.",
      "After Colbert took the case to trial and was convicted, the judge ordered her to pay Butler $50,000 in restitution, with monthly payments of $834 for five years, according to the court records. So far, Butler said, he has not received any money.",
      "In a message to Campbell\u2019s office in December, Butler wrote that he had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about Colbert\u2019s sentence.",
      "\u201cThe minimal fines and lack of meaningful incarceration for crimes that could have led to serious injury or loss of life are, quite frankly, an insult to public safety and the justice system,\u201d Butler wrote in a message that he shared with NBC News. \u201cIf someone dies due to her actions in the future, their blood will undeniably be on the hands of those who allowed her to escape real accountability today.\u201d",

      "Ravaged by two years of brutal civil war and with over 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance, President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan.",
      "As battles rage in the North African country, a network of communal kitchens has had to immediately stop most of its operations due to a lack of funding, about 75% of which came from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to their organizers.",
      "Part of Sudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs) \u2014\u00a0a civilian-led, grassroots effort to provide humanitarian support \u2014 the kitchens have been able to provide food, medicine and other basic supplies to people in parts of the country unreachable by aid agencies.",
      "Without the American funding \u201ca lot of people will die because of hunger,\u201d Abuzar Osman Suliman, the coordinator of the ERRs in Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region, told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Suliman, who said it cost $10,000 for a single kitchen in Darfur to feed 250 families for two weeks, gave a 10 to 20 day window for people to start dying.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 freezing foreign assistance, forcing American-funded aid and development programs worldwide to shut down and lay off staff.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had sought to mitigate the damage by issuing a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs, but USAID officials and aid groups say neither funding nor staffing have been reinstated in order to allow even the most essential programs to start working again.",
      "In Sudan, Suliman said all 40 of ERRs\u2019 community kitchens had to close in Darfur\u2019s Zamzam camp, where more than 1 million displaced people have sought refuge from the conflict between the country\u2019s two main warring powers \u2014 the Sudanese Armed Forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.",
      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021. But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance spectacularly broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "Because of intense fighting and an ongoing RSF siege in the surrounding area, U.N. agencies have been unable to get substantial amounts of food relief to the Zamzam camp and a famine was declared in the camps in August, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an international system that sets a scale used by the United Nations and governments.\u00a0So people are now facing the choice between staying in the camp to die from hunger, or risk their lives by moving through Darfur areas besieged by the RSF, Suliman said.",
      "Famine has since spread to four other areas of Sudan, according to the IPC, and is expected to deepen and spread in coming months due to the war and impeded access to humanitarian assistance.",
      "In Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, intense block-by-block fighting has made aid delivery almost impossible.",
      "The World Food Program said it was only able to deliver its first shipment in December, 17 months after the conflict erupted, and even then, it said it had to rely on the ERRs for distribution.",
      "Across Khartoum, the ERRs were operating 742 kitchens and serving around 816,000 people before Trump's executive order, but now 80% of those kitchens have closed, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the Emergency Response Rooms.",
      "In a country riven by ethnic and political divisions, the ERRs have espoused neutrality and solidarity, allowing them to operate in areas controlled by SAF as well as the RSF, leveraging local know-how to navigate hostile terrain.",
      "The kitchens are organized locally and entirely volunteer-led, Kuka said, adding the whole ERR system was run by housewives, doctors, engineers, electricians \u2014 \u201cjust everybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis minute, I\u2019m trying to save the lives of the people in the district and the volunteers,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just, like, going crazy trying to get any money.\u201d",
      "Without immediate funding, famine could take hold in the city, he added.",
      "Because USAID was often distributing money through other nongovernmental organizations working in Sudan, Kuka said the ERR organizers weren\u2019t always aware of how crucial USAID was to their funding, until the money was taken away.",
      "On Friday, Kuka said he found out that a $50,000 grant he expected from the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services (CRS) had been suddenly canceled because of the U.S. freeze.",
      "The humanitarian agency told NBC News they could not comment on the grant cancellation.",
      "CRS, which has about 5,000 employees, told staffers last week to expect layoffs because of the administration\u2019s cuts to their foreign aid grants, according to Reuters. The organization has a $1.5 billion budget, about half of it funded by USAID.",
      "Across Sudan, the cost of operating the kitchens was around $20 million a year, the ERR communications officer said. But the localized ad-hoc nature of the work is also what made them so vulnerable to U.S. funding cuts, Kuka added.",
      "While U.N. agencies may have several months of supplies in the pipeline, the ERRs often relied on purchasing goods directly from local markets. So when the cash flow was cut off, the kitchens could no longer buy and cook food.",
      "Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official and country representative in Sudan, said the exemption issued by Rubio was \u201cvery complicated, nobody really knows how it works.\u201d",
      "Tracy, who is currently vice president of Proximity 2 Humanity, a nonprofit working to shore up funding for Sudan\u2019s ERRs, added that some agencies might be big enough to continue operations, relying on a future reimbursement if an exemption is granted, but a lot of smaller organizations can\u2019t do that.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge paused an order putting USAID staff on administrative leave, but Tracy said it is still not clear to what capacity the agency will be able to operate.",
      "\u201cIn theory they have a week where they\u2019re able to work again \u2014access to emails, etc. \u2014 but what they could do before this was heavily curtailed, so unclear as to how much they can do, like make payments.\u201d",
      "Kuka said he is also appealing to any other institutional donors to fill in the funding gaps, using what little they have left to support emergency assistance programs.",
      "\u201cAfter a month, it will be completely done,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 For years, the Palestinian-owned Educational Bookshop in east Jerusalem has been a rare island of dialogue in an increasingly divided city, but an Israeli police raid on the store this week has sparked fears about the suppression of free speech.",
      "While the well-known store and its smaller branch across the street were open Tuesday, the bust saw detectives confiscate books in trash bags and arrest two members of the owner\u2019s family. The incident has raised broader concerns about the status of shared places where Israelis and Palestinians can peacefully come together and debate.",
      "\u201cI, like many diplomats, enjoy browsing for books at Educational Bookshop. I know its owners, the Muna family, to be peace-loving proud Palestinian Jerusalemites, open for discussion and intellectual exchange,\u201d Steffen Seibert, Germany\u2019s ambassador to Israel, said in a post on X.",
      "\u201cI am concerned to hear of the raid and their detention in prison,\u201d he added.",
      "The store, founded on Salah al-Din Street in 1984 by the Muna family, sells books in many languages that largely focus on the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has long been known in the area as an intellectual oasis where readers from across the political divide can share ideas.",
      "Security footage from Sunday afternoon that the Muna family shared with NBC News showed plainclothes officers rifling through books and taking away some of them in garbage bags.",
      "During the raid on the predominantly English-language store, officers also arrested the manager, Mahmoud Muna, and his nephew Ahmad. Both have since been released.",
      "Mahmoud\u2019s brother, Morad, said that the police had taken books with a Palestinian flag or icon printed on them and that they used Google Translate to help understand what the material was saying.",
      "\u201cIn our book, anyone from any religion, from any side, can say his opinion without being afraid. He can discuss any kind of thing,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIn the west side of Jerusalem, there are English bookstores that have the same books that we have, and you will never hear that they arrested the owners,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson from the Israeli police said that the two were arrested on suspicion of \u201cselling books containing incitement and support for terrorism at bookstores in Jerusalem.\u201d",
      "Police added that the detectives had confiscated from the store \u201cnumerous books containing inciteful material,\u201d pointing to the children\u2019s coloring book titled \u201cFrom the River to the Sea,\u201d written by South African author Nathi Ngubane, as one example. The police added that they had also raided a bookshop in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City last week, which had material supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic State group.",
      "The title of the coloring book is also a pro-Palestinian slogan often used at protests against Israel and refers to the geographical area between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea that encompasses Israel and the Palestinian territories.",
      "The American Jewish Committee says on its website that the slogan \u201ccan be used to call for the elimination of the State of Israel and/or ethnic cleansing of Jews living there,\u201d while the South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies protested the publication of the book when it was initially released.",
      "Wasim Khalis, who owns a clothing store next door to Educational Bookshop, said he had been drinking coffee in the bookstore around 3 p.m. local time when four plainclothes officers entered. After a few minutes, he said, the officers flashed a warrant and asked customers to leave, while a second group of officers went across the street to another store owned by the family.",
      "\u201cIt was very strange,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a new store; it has been here for decades. They took items that were very normal and could be found anywhere, including on the internet.\u201d",
      "Some 10 diplomats including those from the European Union and the United Kingdom sat in on a debate Monday on the Munas\u2019 release date at Jerusalem\u2019s District Court. Meanwhile, supporters of the Educational Bookstore wrote about their alarm at the raid online, with a smaller number gathering outside the courthouse.",
      "\u201cWe fear that the raid on the store, the confiscation of books from it, and the imprisonment of its owner under the pretext of \u2018violating public order\u2019 is a regime provocation designed to erase the Palestinian cultural narrative and harass those involved in it,\u201d Israeli author Ilan Sheinfeld said in a post on X.",
      "One of the in-person protesters was Galit Samuel, an Israeli patron who had traveled from Tel Aviv to be there. She said of the Munas that \u201cthey are both men of peace, and they are promoting Palestinian culture in peaceful ways.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable that such people were arrested and books were confiscated,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a grave attack on free speech and free thinking.\u201d"

      "BERLIN \u2014 A doctor in Berlin who was first arrested in August on suspicion of killing four elderly patients is now suspected of killing a total of 10 patients and, in five cases, trying to cover up the evidence by starting fires, investigators said Tuesday.",
      "The unidentified doctor, who was part of a nursing service\u2019s palliative care team, was\u00a0initially suspected\u00a0of killing four patients in June and July and then attempting, with mixed success, to set fire to their apartments. In November, investigators said they had found evidence that indicated he\u00a0killed four more patients, and on Tuesday they said they suspect him of killing a further two patients.",
      "Police and prosecutors said Tuesday that the two additional cases surfaced when they examined patients\u2019 files and carried out forensic examinations, including exhumations.",
      "The two latest cases include the alleged killing of a 25-year-old woman in her apartment in Berlin in Sept. 2021, in which the 40-year-old doctor is suspected of giving the woman a lethal mixture of various drugs with the intention of killing her.",
      "In addition, he is suspected of murdering a 57-year-old woman last June, also in her apartment in Berlin, by administered a lethal mixture of medications, investigators said.",
      "Prosecutors and police said in a joint statement that the accused is said to have had no motive beyond killing, and that the suspect\u2019s acts meet the legal definition of \u201clust for murder.\u201d",
      "According to the latest findings, the killings took place between Sept. 2021 and last summer.",

    "story": [
      "Bills introduced by Republicans in the Texas Senate would require the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public schools and allow for schools to carve out time for students to read the Bible, in the latest effort by lawmakers in states to infuse religious doctrine in public education.",
      "\"The Ten Commandments are part of our Texas and American story,\" Sen. Phil King, the lead author of the bill, said in a statement Monday, adding that \"if our students don't know the Ten Commandments, they will never understand the foundation for much of American history and law.\"",
      "Meanwhile, another bill was filed that would permit school districts to adopt policies allowing for a period of prayer and reading of scripture or \"other religious text\" with parental consent.",
      "\"Our schools are not God-free zones,\" the bill's author, Sen. Mayes Middleton, said in a statement, while also thanking President Donald Trump and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick for \"making prayer in public schools a top priority.\"",
      "A previous push to get a Ten Commandments bill passed in the Texas Legislature failed in 2023 because of time constraints, but Patrick has said that among his primary concerns for the current session, which began last month, will be ensuring the legislation's success. He also applauded Louisiana, which last year became the first state to require the Ten Commandments to be displayed in all public school and college classrooms.",
      "While Louisiana's law went into effect Jan. 1, its implementation remains in limbo after a coalition of parents sued in federal court, arguing that the requirement interferes with\u00a0their First Amendment right to raise their children with whatever religious doctrine they choose. A federal appeals court is expected to rule on the matter after a lower court judge concluded in November that Louisiana had not offered \"any constitutional way to display the Ten Commandments.\"",
      "King said he believes his bill stands up to scrutiny following a 2022 Supreme Court ruling that found a former Washington state high school football coach had a right to pray on the field immediately after games. The ruling by the conservative-majority court took a different approach by examining \"historical practices and understandings\" to interpret whether the First Amendment was being violated.",
      "\"The legislation is in accord with the history and traditions of our state and nation,\" King said, adding that students will \"appreciate the role of the Ten Commandments in our heritage.\"",
      "The Supreme Court previously took up the issue of the Ten Commandments in public schools in 1980, when it struck down a Kentucky law as unconstitutional.",
      "Louisiana's law and the introduction of similar bills throughout the country could propel the issue before the high court yet again.",
      "A Kentucky bill introduced last month would allow public schools to post the Ten Commandments but would not make it a requirement. An Ohio bill would require schools to select from a list of nine historical documents to display in classrooms, the Ten Commandments among the options. And in Georgia, a bill filed last week would force public elementary and secondary schools to place copies of the Ten Commandments in certain locations, such as the main entrance of a building.",
      "Similar Ten Commandments bills in Montana and North Dakota have been debated in recent weeks, while a bill in South Dakota failed Monday in the House in a 37-31 vote.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers were among those who voted against South Dakota's bill that would have compelled public schools to display the Ten Commandments, with those GOP legislators arguing that the bill could have been stronger and others uneasy with the government creating such a mandate.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, which is supporting the parents' lawsuit against Louisiana's Ten Commandments law, said the bill's rejection in South Dakota should serve as a \"reality check\" for bringing religious text into public education.",
      "\"Public schools are not Sunday schools, and today's vote ensures that our public school classrooms will remain spaces where all students, regardless of their faith, feel welcomed,\" Samantha Chapman, ACLU of South Dakota advocacy manager, said in a statement.",
      "Texas' Ten Commandments bill could face an easier road ahead in the Republican-controlled Legislature because it was introduced earlier in the session and is a higher priority among Republican leaders, after a deadline was missed for it to advance in 2023. Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, posted on X last month in reference to a reintroduced bill: \"Let's do it.\"",
      "Still, Republicans can expect opposition from Democrats who have said the state should focus on the full funding of public schools rather than wedge issues.",
      "\"This is a divisive bill that distracts from real solutions for Texans,\" Sen. Sarah Eckhardt said. \"Segregation along religious lines is still segregation, and that is the reason for separating church and state.\""

      "Federal prosecutors said Filion was making the fake threats both for recreation and to make money. In online posts in January 2023, he admitted making the calls for about two to three years before he eventually decided to make it a business, officials said.",
      "Most of the calls were made when Filion was 16, prosecutors have said.",
      "Filion wrote in a post on Jan. 20, 2023, that when he swats someone he usually gets \"the cops to drag the victim and their families out of the house cuff them and search the house for dead bodies.\u201d",
      "About a year later, Filion was arrested on Florida state charges over a 2023 call in which he claimed to have an illegally modified AR-15, a Glock 17 pistol, pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails.\u00a0He targeted a mosque in that case, threatening to commit a mass shooting on the premises.",
      "According to court records, while he on the phone with the police, Filion played audio of gunfire in the background, which prompted more than 30 law enforcement officers to respond to the mosque.",
      "Once they were inside, officers realized that there was no gunman and that everyone was safe.",
      "He pleaded guilty in federal court in that incident, the Justice Department said.",
      "Filion also pleaded guilty to three other incidents: a October 2022 call threatening a high school in Washington, a fake May 2023 bomb threat at a historically black college or university in Florida and a July 2023 call in which he falsely identified himself as a federal law enforcement officer who had killed his mother.",
      "He also gave a dispatcher the address of an officer\u2019s residence and threatened to shoot anyone who responded, the Justice Department said."

      "Paul Martin, who had been USAID\u2019s inspector general since 2023, was notified of his dismissal by email.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "\u201cOn behalf of President Donald J.\u00a0Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as Inspector General of the United States Agency for International Development is terminated, effective immediately,\u201d Trent Morse,\u00a0deputy director\u00a0of the Office of Presidential Personnel, informed Martin in an email obtained by NBC News. \u201cThank you for your service.\u201d",
      "CNN first reported Martin\u2019s firing.",
      "The report by USAID's Office of the Inspector General, led by Martin, warned of the dangers associated with the gap in staffing, including a lack of oversight that may leave the agency \u201csusceptible to inadvertently funding entities or salaries of individuals associated with U.S.-designated terrorist organizations.\u201d",
      "It also described the uncertainty surrounding the waivers for lifesaving assistance issued by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, which it said put \u201cmore than $489 million of food assistance at ports, in transit, and in warehouses at risk of spoilage, unanticipated storage needs, and diversion.\u201d",
      "Martin informed his staff of his removal shortly after he received the termination notice.",
      "\u201cIt has been a true honor and pleasure to walk alongside my OIG colleagues around the world as we sought to provide independent and aggressive oversight of USAID programs and personnel,\u201d Martin wrote in the email. \u201cTake care of yourselves and take care of each other.

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:41:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Sen. Dick Durbin accused Kash Patel, President Trump's pick for FBI director, of secretly orchestrating the firings of FBI officials.",
    "story": [
      "The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee has sent a letter to the Justice Department Inspector General accusing Kash Patel, President Trump's pick for FBI director, of secretly orchestrating the firings of FBI officials, a day after telling the committee under oath that he was not aware of any plan to do so.",
      "\u201cIf these allegations are true, Mr. Patel may have perjured himself before the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., wrote.",
      "Durbin said\u00a0he has spoken\u00a0to whistleblowers who\u00a0told him that\u00a0Patel has been\u00a0relaying\u00a0instructions to White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, who then relayed Patel's instructions to acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove.",
      "\u201cI have received highly credible information from multiple sources that Kash Patel has been personally directing the ongoing purge of career civil servants at the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\u201d Durbin wrote in the letter. \u201cAlthough Mr. Patel is President Trump\u2019s nominee to be FBI Director, he is still a private citizen with no role in government.\u201d",
      "Durbin, whose letter was first reported by The New York Times, described a meeting the day before Patel's confirmation hearing where Bove said Patel and Miller were pushing for firings at the FBI, as had already occurred at the Department of Justice.",
      "\"Contemporaneous notes from that morning meeting read: 'KP wants movement at FBI, reciprocal actions for DOJ,'\u201d Durbin wrote, an apparent reference to Patel's initials.",
      "In a social media post, Erika Knight, a spokesperson for Patel, did not directly address Durbin's letter but decried what she described as a \"false narrative.\"",
      "\u201cKash Patel is a highly qualified national security expert who has been fully transparent with the American people throughout this process and has demonstrated the integrity and leadership needed for this role,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe Senate should confirm him without delay.\u201d",
      "Durbin noted\u00a0that, during Patel's confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J.,  asked Patel if he was \"aware of any plans or discussions to punish in any way, including termination, FBI agents or personnel associated with Trump investigations? Yes or no.\u201d",
      "Patel answered that he was \u201cnot aware of that.\u201d\u00a0Patel then added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on right now over there, but I\u2019m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues that I will honor the internal review process of the FBI.\u201d",
      "Patel also stated in the hearing, \u201cAll FBI employees will be protected against political retribution.\u201d",
      "The following day,\u00a0acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll sent a memo to the entire FBI workforce saying that he had been ordered to remove eight senior FBI executives by Bove, who previously worked as Trump's defense lawyer. Driscoll also said he was told to turn over the names of every FBI employee involved in investigating Jan. 6 rioters, a number believed to be in the thousands.",
      "Driscoll refused a Justice Department order that he assist in the firing of agents involved in Jan. 6 riot cases, pushing back so forcefully that some FBI officials feared he would be dismissed, multiple current and former FBI officials previously told NBC News.",
      "Continued fears of mass firings",
      "The Trump administration has also asked the FBI's field offices and headquarters to justify the continued employment of 3,600 bureau employees \u2014 roughly 10% of the FBI\u2019s workforce \u2014 who joined the bureau recently and as a result are on probationary status.",
      "The FBI Agents Association, a group that represents agents but is not a union, said that special agents on probation have already undergone extensive training at the FBI Academy in Quantico. They say the agents are already working on active investigations and mass dismissals could disrupt them.",
      "In an interview with NBC News Tuesday, Natalie Bara, the president of the FBI Agents Association, said that it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to train an agent, from their initial application to their graduation from Quantico.",
      "Bara said the bureau needs to add 800 to 1,000 special agents each year to replace retiring special agents, so mass firings would impact the bureau for years.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to turn around and fire or dismiss agents who have already been through this process,\" Bara said.",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Patel's nomination on Thursday. It's unclear whether Durbin's perjury claim will have an impact on Republican senators, who have so far uniformly defended Patel.",
      "If his nomination is approved by the committee, the full Senate will vote on whether to confirm Patel to a 10-year-term as FBI director."

      "It\u2019s not unusual for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d to have viewers in stitches, but it\u2019s also not out of the ordinary for the show\u2019s own stars to follow suit.",
      "Yes, the long-running comedy series, which is celebrating its 50th season this year, has been known to feature memorable sketches that cause performers to break character and laugh, which, in turn, causes the studio audience and viewers at home to lose control, too. You can be sure these moments resonate and get people talking \u2014 well, at least after they\u2019re done laughing.",

      "A serious NewsNation town hall conversation about the dangers of AI goes off the rails when a man (guest host Ryan Gosling) who looks eerily similar to Beavis from MTV\u2019s \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head\u201d sits in the audience. When he\u2019s replaced by another man who resembles Butt-Head (Mikey Day), town hall host Heidi Gardner asks him to move, but not before she laughs and turns away from the camera in an attempt to collect herself.",
      "Her laughter goes on for quite a few seconds, while the audience howls in delight. When the faux Butt-Head starts talking to her and pleads ignorance, she continues laughing. Even after he walks away, Gardner still has trouble keeping a straight face as she tries to plow ahead with the sketch, which went viral.",
      "A few seconds later, we see Beavis and Butt-Head are seated together and that Gosling is busting a gut laughing, while Day also struggles to play it straight. Even Chloe Fineman, who has a bit part at the end, has to work hard to get through her lines, while all the extras in the scene actually do a masterful job of remaining serious.",
      "\u2018Lisa from Temecula\u2019 \u2014 Season 48 (2023)",
      "Ego Nwodim is hilarious as the hostile self-titled character in this bonkers sketch, who causes host Pedro Pascal to laugh while she violently cuts her steak that she requested \u201cextra, extra well done.\u201d Punkie Johnson also has to cover her mouth and Bowen Yang completely loses it when Nwodim asks if people are complaining because \u201cwe Black.\u201d",

      "What can be said that hasn\u2019t been said about this famous sketch? Chris Farley is deranged motivational speaker Matt Foley, who, as he likes to say, \"lives in a van down by the river.\" He is tasked with trying to get through to teenagers David Spade and host Christina Applegate.",
      "What follows is one of the most popular sketches in the show\u2019s history, with his outrageous behavior sparking fits of laughter from Spade and Applegate, who struggle not to laugh. As he comes down on them, they do all they can to not break. Extra credit here goes to Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks, who play the teens' parents and manage to keep it together the whole sketch.",

      "Bill Hader\u2019s Stefan is a beloved \u201cSNL\u201d character who often broke, with Hader covering his mouth to keep from giggling and showing his smile. As a correspondent on \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d the eccentric Stefan\u2019s bits would often unravel, such as in this instance when he tries to make it through a segment giving Halloween tips for tourists in New York City. At one point, he buries his head in his hands while laughing and completely loses it.",
      "Hader often laughed while playing Stefon, but there's good reason for it. He created the character with John Mulaney, who co-created the character while working at \"SNL\" and would change lines for him to say without Hader knowing before he went onstage.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll put stuff up without telling me, or, he\u2019ll tell me as I walk out. Anything to kind of shake me up,\u201d Hader\u00a0told Howard Stern\u00a0in 2013.",

      "Fallon has to turn away from the camera while he and Hayes, who also starts losing it, go at it with a customer, played by Horatio Sanz. But when Will Ferrell, who had a knack for getting cast members to crack up, putters into the store in a motorized scooter and a tiny cell phone, all bets are off: Fallon and Hayes are cackling like there\u2019s no tomorrow.",
      "\u2018The Love-ahs\u2019 \u2014 Season 27 (2007)",

      "The first few minutes are uneventful, but Fallon starts to break after host Drew Barrymore gives a speech about her ex. Barrymore also starts to smile a bit and Dratch loses it when she and Ferrell share a plate of food. Soon, Ferrell joins Dratch with a case of the giggles that bubbles over more than the hot tub itself, as even Barrymore has trouble keeping her performance in line.",
      "\u2018Debbie Downer: Disney World\u2019 \u2014 Season 29 (2004)",
      "A family trip to Disney World is ruined when Dratch dampens the excitement by only talking about depressing topics. Fallon and Dratch can\u2019t contain their chuckles and Amy Poehler keeps her focus on a plate of food to try and collect herself. Soon, Sanz and host Lindsay Lohan join the party.",

      "Let\u2019s go old school here in this Season 2 sketch, which features a message from the Right to Extreme Stupidity League. Bergen laughs when she points out Gilda Radner\u2019s Fern is kind of dumb after she pours milk into her purse. Radner quickly follows suit. When Radner turns to speak to the camera, Bergen is knee deep in laughter. It\u2019s a fun watch from two of the titans of comedy.",
      "\u2018The Californians: Stuart Has Cancer\u2019 \u2014 Season 37 (2012)",
      "Hader has trouble from the jump in this soap opera parody, in which he, Kristen Wiig and Fred Armisen show off exaggerated California accents while everyone gets overly specific about the routes they take to get places. Armisen also laughs early on, which sets off Hader even more. Wiig joins the party while giving directions to Armisen after host Josh Brolin, playing a doctor, informs him he has cancer.",
      "\u2018Super Showcase Spokesmodels\u2019 \u2014 Season 37 (2012)",
      "Maya Rudolph and Wiig are game show supermodels with heavy accents who struggle to keep their cool while telling losing contestant Vanessa Bayer what she didn\u2019t win. Wiig especially falls apart while plugging some frozen chicken. Things don\u2019t get much better for her when she starts wheeling around in a golf cart and exits the sketch by plowing through a sign."

      "On Instagram, she wrote of her performance, \"I died a little!\"",
      "Williams\u2019 appearance in the halftime show is also raising eyebrows because Lamar brought her out on stage during a song that\u2019s commonly known as a diss to Drake.

      "Add to the mix that Williams and Drake also dated, and you\u2019ll see why the tennis champion\u2019s appearance was so potent.",
      "What is a crip walk? Serena Williams\u2019 history with the dance",
      "Crip-walking is a dance move that derives its name from the Crips, a Los Angeles street gang.",
      "According to the book \u201cHip Hop Around the World,\u201d the crip walk originated in California in the early 1970s.",
      "The footwork, when the move started, was meant to spell out words, especially C-R-I-P.\u00a0 \u201cAs the dance developed over time, leg movements such as bending the knees and then straightening to create a pumping action or pointing the feet outward from the knees then sliding the feet in unison also became common,\u201d the encyclopedia entry, written by humanities professor Anthony J. Fonseca, explains.",
      "Anything that\u2019s associated with gang life is often mired in controversy, and crip-walking is no exception. In 2002, some Los Angeles schools banned the move from parties and proms, per the Los Angeles Times.",
      "Williams herself made headlines for crip-walking in 2012 after beating Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon. The Guardian at the time captured Williams fielding questions about it at a press conference three weeks after the winning match. \u201cAll people know that the crip walk is not just a dance,\u201d a journalist said.",
      "Williams responded, per the Guardian, \u201cIt was just a dance. I didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what it was called. Second, why are you asking me that? If anything, you should be trying to ask me questions to lift me up not bring such things \u2026 I\u2019m done with that question.\u201d",
      "Both Lamar and Williams grew up in Compton, California. It\u2019s also the city where Williams\u2019 half-sister, Yetunde Price, was killed in a drive-by shooting in 2003. A local gang member was later convicted of Price\u2019s murder.",
      "After Williams was essentially cancelled for crip-walking in 2012, her Super Bowl performance brought mixed reactions from social media users. Some were impressed with her dance moves, including one X user who commented, \u201cI saw you and screamed, \u2018That\u2019s Serena, I know that crip walk!\u2019\u201d",
      "Another wrote, \u201cI think half of my neighborhood heard me screaming your name! Looking good.\u201d",
      "Still, some X users wondered why Williams would do a dance that\u2019s associated with gangs given the way her sister died.",
      "\u201cWas kinda of shocked\u2026. Always figured you as more class than crip walking on live TV given your sister\u2019s situation. Still love ya but shocked!\u201d one commented.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time Williams has publicly crip-walked since Wimbledon, however. She also did the move at the ESPY Awards during her opening monologue in July 2024 \u2014 and happened to mention Lamar and Drake\u2019s beef.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019ve learned anything this year, it\u2019s that none of us \u2014 not a single one of us, not even me \u2014 should ever pick a fight with Kendrick Lamar,\u201d she said.",
      "When the song \u201cNot Like Us\u201d began to play, Williams briefly crip-walked then said, \u201cHe will make your hometown not like you. The next time Drake sits courtside at a Raptors game, they\u2019re going to 'Forrest Gump' him. Seat's taken!\u201d",
      "What Serena Williams\u2019 history with Drake has to do with this",
      "Williams has been married to Alexis Ohanian since 2017 and the couple shares two children. But once upon a time, Williams dated Drake, a rapper known for hits like \u201cHotline Bling\u201d and \u201cHold On, We\u2019re Going Home.\u201d",
      "Drake references Serena in a few of his songs, including the 2013 song \u201cWorst Behavior,\u201d where he raps, \u201cI swear I could beat Serena when she playin\u2019 with her left.\u201d",
      "The rapper also name-dropped the tennis player in his 2022 song \u201cMiddle of the Ocean,\u201d where he rapped, \u201cSidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie.\u201d",
      "Ohanian appeared to address the diss in a post on X, writing, \u201cThe reason I stay winning is because I\u2019m relentless about being the absolute best at whatever I do \u2014 including being the best groupie for my wife & daughter.\u201d",
      "Williams responded with a string of hearts.",
      "Lamar, meanwhile, also has sung about Williams. In the Drake diss track \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Lamar suggests that Drake \u201cbetter not speak on Serena.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot Like Us\u201d also levels more serious accusations against Drake. In \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Lamar raps, \u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2018em young/ You better not ever go to cell block one.\u201d He later says, \u201cCertified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles,\u201d a play on Drake's 2021 album, \u201cCertified Lover Boy.\u201d",
      "Drake has since filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Group, which represents both Drake and Lamar, for defamation and harassment, saying that the company helped to spread a \u201cfalse and malicious\u201d narrative about him.",
      "During the Super Bowl on Feb. 9, Lamar didn\u2019t use the word \u201cpedophile\u201d when he performed \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d but he seemed to pretend to pat a child\u2019s head while saying, \u201cDrake, I hear you like \u2018em young.\u201d",
      "X users had a range of mixed reactions to the performance. For starters, some didn\u2019t know Williams dated Drake.",

      "Others were confused about the rationale behind Williams\u2019 appearance, including one who wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t understand the logic in Kendrick bringing Serena Williams, Drakes older ex-girlfriend, onstage to dance to a song about Drake being a pedophile.\u201d",

As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain,\u201d she said in her statement, according to NBC News. \u201cAll my life I have fought for a better world.

      "\u201cI\u2019m sad. Time and time again, that\u2019s the word because that is the sentiment that has been living in my chest since everything happened,\u201d Salda\u00f1a said. \u201cI\u2019m also disappointed. I can\u2019t speak for other people\u2019s actions. All I can attest to is my experience, and never in a million years did I ever believe that we would be here.\u201d",

      "He mourned recent developments in light of the previous \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201cexceptional atmosphere\u201d he said he and Gasc\u00f3n shared while making the film.",
      "\u201cWhen you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\u201d",
      "He was also direct when asked if he had been in touch with Gasc\u00f3n since her past comments emerged.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to her, and I don\u2019t want to. She is in a self-destructive approach that I can\u2019t interfere in, and I really don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s continuing. Why is she harming herself? Why?\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m thinking of myself, I\u2019m thinking of Zoe and Selena,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s continuing to harm us.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not getting in touch with her because right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions,\u201d he added.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n responded to the director\u2019s comments in an Instagram post.",
      "\u201cFollowing Jacques (sic) interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself, hoping my silence will allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference,\u201d she wrote, sharing a cast photo from the Cannes Film Festival.",

      "Tennis great Williams, who was briefly linked to Drake in 2011, appeared onstage during the song's performance, showing off her dance moves in a playful crip walk.",
      "Williams' surprise cameo seemed noteworthy given that Lamar, her fellow Compton native, name drops her on \"Not Like Us.\" Lamar appears to warn Drake \u2014\u00a0 who previously called Williams' husband, Alexis Ohanian, a \"groupie\" on his 2022 track  \u201cMiddle Of The Ocean\u201d \u2014\u00a0that he  \"better not speak on Serena\" again.",

The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected.

      "\u201cGomez is critiqued for experiencing the typical challenges of heritage speakers while being held to native speaker standards \u2014 a no-win situation that a rapidly growing number of Americans can relate to,\u201d Abbott wrote in a recent opinion piece for The Fulcrum.",

      "\u201cThe author misses the point completely. This has nothing to do with racism. Selena Gomez should be proud of her Spanish,\u201d the X user wrote. \u201cBut her accent doesn\u2019t match the character that she plays in the movie. And that\u2019s very distracting for viewers who know exactly how Mexicans speak.\u201d",
      "Director Audiard has addressed issues with the actors' varying Spanish accents in the movie.",
      "\u201cThroughout the shoot we had problems, for instance, with Selena\u2019s accent in Spanish. She is Texan. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n speaks Castilian Spanish. She\u2019s from Madrid,\u201d he told The New York Times in November. \u201cGiven that I don\u2019t speak Spanish, the nuances of the Mexican accent versus the Castilian were lost on me.

      "Some critics say the film perpetuates the harmful narrative that transitioning is a form of lying. Emilia keeps her past a secret from her wife, posing as Manitas' aunt.",
      "\u201cIts protagonist\u2019s transition is seen as duplicitous and dishonest, an act of manipulation through which she continues her selfish attempts to control those that she abandoned,\u201d Mattie Lucas wrote in a November review for Trans | Cendental Cinema.",
      "\u201cNot only is her transition portrayed as more of a disguise to evade the authorities, it\u2019s an act of continued selfishness that ends up destroying not only her own life, but the lives of those she loves,\u201d Lucas added.",
      "Film critic Juan Barquin called the movie \u201ca regressive picture masquerading as progressive\u201d and criticized the way masculinity and femininity were portrayed in the film.",

      "Several critics and viewers, including Barquin, also took issue with one line from the movie in which Emilia describes herself as \u201chalf male, half female.\u201d",
      "Some transgender commentators shared counterpoints to these arguments and defended the film\u2019s representation of its trans protagonist.",
      "Journalist and critic Mey Rude, who is trans, rejected the argument that Emilia uses a \u201cmale voice\u201d in moments of anger.",
      "\u201cShe simply is a woman with a lower register, and when she gets angry, it shows,\u201d Rude wrote in a piece for Out Magazine. \u201cIf you listen to the scenes where Gasc\u00f3n is playing the character as Manitas, you can clearly hear a difference in the voice she uses in the fight scene with Gomez.\u201d",
      "Rude also argues that the film does not lean into \u201charmful trans tropes about trans women being deceptive or liars.\u201d",
      "\u201cEmilia isn\u2019t a liar because she\u2019s trans, she\u2019s a liar because she\u2019s a bad person and she\u2019s in many ways, afraid,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe movie shows that if you live a lie, whether you\u2019re trans or not, your lies will catch up with you.\u201d",
      "Writer Julie River, who is trans, argues in a piece for Out Front magazine that Emilia is portrayed sensitively as a \u201cmorally complex\u201d character who makes \u201ca desperate attempt to atone for her sins in her former life.\u201d",
      "River also argues that Emilia hides her transition not because the movie is painting trans people as duplicitous, but because as a cartel leader, Emilia \"was hardly surrounded by people who were easy to come out to or who were likely to accept her transition.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may be amongst the minority in the LGBTQ+ community doing this, but I\u2019ll be applauding it for every award it wins,\u201d River wrote.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II said he reiterated Tuesday during a meeting with President Donald Trump his country's and the region's \"steadfast opposition\" to the president's plan to resettle millions of Palestinians out of Gaza.",
      "\u201cI stressed that my foremost commitment is to Jordan, to its stability and to the well-being of Jordanians,\u201d he said on X.\u00a0\u201cI reiterated Jordan\u2019s steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is the unified Arab position.\u201d",
      "Earlier in the day, Abdullah told Trump he could take in 2,000 Palestinian children from Gaza who are very sick or have cancer. But the king later confirmed his longstanding position against displacing millions of Palestinians from their homes as Trump has suggested.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Trump said during their meeting Tuesday that he expected progress toward his plan and believed \u201c99%\u201d that something could be worked out with Egypt, another regional partner that had bristled at the president's surprise. \"We'll have some others helping,\" Trump added.",
      "Seated with Trump in the Oval Office, Abdullah said they must ensure a plan that satisfies all parties, a not insignificant obstacle as questions remain about how each country might move to relocate a swell of people who have suffered months of devastation, and which some fear will further undermine efforts to create a Palestinian state. More than 1 million Palestinians remain without homes, and the king declined to say whether he would be willing to take in refugees in larger numbers. \"We have to look at the best interests of the United States, of the people in the region, especially to my people of Jordan,\" he said.",
      "Questioned further by reporters about Trump\u2019s ideas, the king said he would refrain from saying much until Egypt had a chance to weigh in. His statement following the meeting with Trump made clear that the sides remain far apart.",
      "\u201cRebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,\u201d he said on X. \u201cAchieving just peace on the basis of the two-state solution is the way to ensure regional stability.\u201d",
      "There are already over 2 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan,\u00a0according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees,\u00a0which says that most of them have citizenship. Jordan's Queen Rania and her family were Palestinian refugees who fled Kuwait.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal to \u201cown\u201d the Gaza Strip and relocate its residents has stirred opposition from the U.S.\u2019s Arab partners and from world leaders across the globe who largely favor a two-state solution. However, Trump has not ceded the proposal and continued in the days since to press his ideas to take over and develop the territory after first announcing it last week during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s visit to the White House.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Monday night, Trump said that those leaving Gaza would not have a right to return and named Egypt and Jordan as two countries that he expects to take in Palestinians. Trump said it\u2019s a project he wants to start \u201calmost immediately.\u201d He has referred to the territory as a demolition site.",
      "On Tuesday, he billed it as a step toward bringing \u201cpeace to the Middle East\u201d and said it would become a driver of new jobs in the region. \u201cWe\u2019re going to run it very properly,\u201d Trump told reporters and reiterated his ideas for a development plan for the territory that includes hotels and other investments. Seated to the president's left were top advisers and officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, chief of staff Susie Wiles and national security adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a death trap,\u201d Trump said of Gaza as he mused about the possibilities. He said that it's a place where no one would want to stay, and \u201cthey are living in hell.\u201d",
      "Asked if he would consider withholding U.S. aid, Trump suggested he had moved on from the idea, telling reporters, \u201cI do think we\u2019re above that.\u201d",
      "\"We contribute a lot of money to Jordan and to Egypt, by the way, a lot to both, but I don\u2019t have to threaten that,\" Trump said, seeming to walk back the suggestion that he was open to it.",
      "A reliable U.S. partner, Abdullah now finds himself weighing a tentative path forward after America\u2019s Arab partners, including Jordan and Egypt, rejected Trump\u2019s proposal last week. On the eve of his meeting with Trump, the U.S. president threatened to cut off aid to Jordan, an annual sum of more than $1 billion.

    "story": [
      "Ravaged by two years of brutal civil war and with over 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance, President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan.",
      "As battles rage in the North African country, a network of communal kitchens has had to immediately stop most of its operations due to a lack of funding, about 75% of which came from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to their organizers.",
      "Part of Sudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs) \u2014\u00a0a civilian-led, grassroots effort to provide humanitarian support \u2014 the kitchens have been able to provide food, medicine and other basic supplies to people in parts of the country unreachable by aid agencies.",
      "Without the American funding \u201ca lot of people will die because of hunger,\u201d Abuzar Osman Suliman, the coordinator of the ERRs in Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region, told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Suliman, who said it cost $10,000 for a single kitchen in Darfur to feed 250 families for two weeks, gave a 10 to 20 day window for people to start dying.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 freezing foreign assistance, forcing American-funded aid and development programs worldwide to shut down and lay off staff.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had sought to mitigate the damage by issuing a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs, but USAID officials and aid groups say neither funding nor staffing have been reinstated in order to allow even the most essential programs to start working again.",
      "In Sudan, Suliman said all 40 of ERRs\u2019 community kitchens had to close in Darfur\u2019s Zamzam camp, where more than 1 million displaced people have sought refuge from the conflict between the country\u2019s two main warring powers \u2014 the Sudanese Armed Forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.",
      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021. But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance spectacularly broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "Because of intense fighting and an ongoing RSF siege in the surrounding area, U.N. agencies have been unable to get substantial amounts of food relief to the Zamzam camp and a famine was declared in the camps in August, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an international system that sets a scale used by the United Nations and governments.\u00a0So people are now facing the choice between staying in the camp to die from hunger, or risk their lives by moving through Darfur areas besieged by the RSF, Suliman said.",
      "Famine has since spread to four other areas of Sudan, according to the IPC, and is expected to deepen and spread in coming months due to the war and impeded access to humanitarian assistance.",
      "In Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, intense block-by-block fighting has made aid delivery almost impossible.",
      "The World Food Program said it was only able to deliver its first shipment in December, 17 months after the conflict erupted, and even then, it said it had to rely on the ERRs for distribution.",
      "Across Khartoum, the ERRs were operating 742 kitchens and serving around 816,000 people before Trump's executive order, but now 80% of those kitchens have closed, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the Emergency Response Rooms.",
      "In a country riven by ethnic and political divisions, the ERRs have espoused neutrality and solidarity, allowing them to operate in areas controlled by SAF as well as the RSF, leveraging local know-how to navigate hostile terrain.",
      "The kitchens are organized locally and entirely volunteer-led, Kuka said, adding the whole ERR system was run by housewives, doctors, engineers, electricians \u2014 \u201cjust everybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis minute, I\u2019m trying to save the lives of the people in the district and the volunteers,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just, like, going crazy trying to get any money.\u201d",
      "Without immediate funding, famine could take hold in the city, he added.",
      "Because USAID was often distributing money through other nongovernmental organizations working in Sudan, Kuka said the ERR organizers weren\u2019t always aware of how crucial USAID was to their funding, until the money was taken away.",
      "On Friday, Kuka said he found out that a $50,000 grant he expected from the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services (CRS) had been suddenly canceled because of the U.S. freeze.",
      "The humanitarian agency told NBC News they could not comment on the grant cancellation.",
      "CRS, which has about 5,000 employees, told staffers last week to expect layoffs because of the administration\u2019s cuts to their foreign aid grants, according to Reuters. The organization has a $1.5 billion budget, about half of it funded by USAID.",
      "Across Sudan, the cost of operating the kitchens was around $20 million a year, the ERR communications officer said. But the localized ad-hoc nature of the work is also what made them so vulnerable to U.S. funding cuts, Kuka added.",
      "While U.N. agencies may have several months of supplies in the pipeline, the ERRs often relied on purchasing goods directly from local markets. So when the cash flow was cut off, the kitchens could no longer buy and cook food.",
      "Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official and country representative in Sudan, said the exemption issued by Rubio was \u201cvery complicated, nobody really knows how it works.\u201d",
      "Tracy, who is currently vice president of Proximity 2 Humanity, a nonprofit working to shore up funding for Sudan\u2019s ERRs, added that some agencies might be big enough to continue operations, relying on a future reimbursement if an exemption is granted, but a lot of smaller organizations can\u2019t do that.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge paused an order putting USAID staff on administrative leave, but Tracy said it is still not clear to what capacity the agency will be able to operate.",
      "\u201cIn theory they have a week where they\u2019re able to work again \u2014access to emails, etc. \u2014 but what they could do before this was heavily curtailed, so unclear as to how much they can do, like make payments.\u201d",
      "Kuka said he is also appealing to any other institutional donors to fill in the funding gaps, using what little they have left to support emergency assistance programs.",
      "\u201cAfter a month, it will be completely done,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 For years, the Palestinian-owned Educational Bookshop in east Jerusalem has been a rare island of dialogue in an increasingly divided city, but an Israeli police raid on the store this week has sparked fears about the suppression of free speech.",
      "While the well-known store and its smaller branch across the street were open Tuesday, the bust saw detectives confiscate books in trash bags and arrest two members of the owner\u2019s family. The incident has raised broader concerns about the status of shared places where Israelis and Palestinians can peacefully come together and debate.",
      "\u201cI, like many diplomats, enjoy browsing for books at Educational Bookshop. I know its owners, the Muna family, to be peace-loving proud Palestinian Jerusalemites, open for discussion and intellectual exchange,\u201d Steffen Seibert, Germany\u2019s ambassador to Israel, said in a post on X.",
      "\u201cI am concerned to hear of the raid and their detention in prison,\u201d he added.",
      "The store, founded on Salah al-Din Street in 1984 by the Muna family, sells books in many languages that largely focus on the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has long been known in the area as an intellectual oasis where readers from across the political divide can share ideas.",
      "Security footage from Sunday afternoon that the Muna family shared with NBC News showed plainclothes officers rifling through books and taking away some of them in garbage bags.",
      "During the raid on the predominantly English-language store, officers also arrested the manager, Mahmoud Muna, and his nephew Ahmad. Both have since been released.",
      "Mahmoud\u2019s brother, Morad, said that the police had taken books with a Palestinian flag or icon printed on them and that they used Google Translate to help understand what the material was saying.",
      "\u201cIn our book, anyone from any religion, from any side, can say his opinion without being afraid. He can discuss any kind of thing,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIn the west side of Jerusalem, there are English bookstores that have the same books that we have, and you will never hear that they arrested the owners,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson from the Israeli police said that the two were arrested on suspicion of \u201cselling books containing incitement and support for terrorism at bookstores in Jerusalem.\u201d",
      "Police added that the detectives had confiscated from the store \u201cnumerous books containing inciteful material,\u201d pointing to the children\u2019s coloring book titled \u201cFrom the River to the Sea,\u201d written by South African author Nathi Ngubane, as one example. The police added that they had also raided a bookshop in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City last week, which had material supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic State group.",
      "The title of the coloring book is also a pro-Palestinian slogan often used at protests against Israel and refers to the geographical area between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea that encompasses Israel and the Palestinian territories.",
      "The American Jewish Committee says on its website that the slogan \u201ccan be used to call for the elimination of the State of Israel and/or ethnic cleansing of Jews living there,\u201d while the South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies protested the publication of the book when it was initially released.",
      "Wasim Khalis, who owns a clothing store next door to Educational Bookshop, said he had been drinking coffee in the bookstore around 3 p.m. local time when four plainclothes officers entered. After a few minutes, he said, the officers flashed a warrant and asked customers to leave, while a second group of officers went across the street to another store owned by the family.",
      "\u201cIt was very strange,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a new store; it has been here for decades. They took items that were very normal and could be found anywhere, including on the internet.\u201d",
      "Some 10 diplomats including those from the European Union and the United Kingdom sat in on a debate Monday on the Munas\u2019 release date at Jerusalem\u2019s District Court. Meanwhile, supporters of the Educational Bookstore wrote about their alarm at the raid online, with a smaller number gathering outside the courthouse.",
      "\u201cWe fear that the raid on the store, the confiscation of books from it, and the imprisonment of its owner under the pretext of \u2018violating public order\u2019 is a regime provocation designed to erase the Palestinian cultural narrative and harass those involved in it,\u201d Israeli author Ilan Sheinfeld said in a post on X.",
      "One of the in-person protesters was Galit Samuel, an Israeli patron who had traveled from Tel Aviv to be there. She said of the Munas that \u201cthey are both men of peace, and they are promoting Palestinian culture in peaceful ways.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable that such people were arrested and books were confiscated,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a grave attack on free speech and free thinking.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe must avoid at all costs resumption of hostilities in Gaza that would lead to immense tragedy,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in a statement. \u201cI appeal to Hamas to proceed with the planned liberation of hostages. Both sides must fully abide by their commitments in the ceasefire agreement and resume serious negotiations.\u201d",
      "Even before Hamas announced its delay in freeing hostages, confidence in the ceasefire has been shaken by Trump\u2019s repeated statements that he wants to permanently remove Palestinians from Gaza so the United States can develop the war zone as a real estate opportunity.",

      "That has alarmed many governments and experts, who point out that forcibly removing people from their homes is classed as ethnic cleansing under international law.

    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 Vice President JD Vance warned European allies Tuesday that the White House would not accept international regulations on artificial intelligence if they held back U.S. ambitions to be the world\u2019s dominant power in the revolutionary new\u00a0technology.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America is the leader in AI, and our administration plans to keep it that way,\u201d Vance told an international AI summit in Paris. \u201cWe need international regulatory regimes that fosters the creation of AI technology rather than strangles it.\u201d",
      "In his first international speech since taking office, Vance said the U.S. was open to cooperating with other countries to harness AI. But he rejected the kind of tighter technology regulations seen in the European Union.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints. Now America cannot and will not accept that.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has made dominance in the field a priority, with the president on Jan. 21 announcing a joint venture to invest billions of dollars in AI infrastructure in the U.S. dubbed Stargate.",
      "Vance also said that AI must remain free from what he called \u201cideological bias\u201d and criticized E.U. efforts to create rules blocking harmful or misleading online content.",
      "\u201cWe want to ensure the internet is a safe place, but it is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,\u201d he said.",
      "Signs of the tensions between the U.S. and Europe on how to approach AI regulation emerged hours after Vance\u2019s speech. The U.S. refused to join around 60 other countries in signing on to a French-led joint statement calling for an \u201cinclusive and sustainable\u201d approach to AI. The White House did not offer an immediate explanation for why it\u00a0declined to sign on.",
      "The global summit in Paris was attended by Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing and came weeks after the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets by announcing it had created a sophisticated model at a fraction of the cost of those made in Silicon Valley.",
      "Vance did not explicitly refer to China in his speech but said \u201cauthoritarian regimes have stolen and used AI to strengthen their military intelligence and surveillance capabilities.\u201d He also warned European states not to partner with authoritarian states on AI development.",
      "\u201cPartnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure,\u201d he said. In addition to the former Biden administration, the Trump administration has also pressured European countries to limit their exposure to Huawei, a Chinese telecom firm.",
      "Speaking at the summit Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said his country would simplify its technology rules but added that Europe would need to cooperate with both the U.S. and China.",
      "Macron also said France\u2019s nuclear power infrastructure made it a desirable location for AI development, because it could power energy-intensive data centers without relying on fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cI have a good friend on the other side of the ocean saying \u2018Drill, baby, drill,\u2019\u201d Macron said, referring to President Donald Trump. \u201cHere, there is no need to drill. It\u2019s \u2018Plug, baby, plug.' Electricity is available.\u201d",
      "Anne Bouverot, Macron\u2019s special envoy to the AI summit, told NBC News that the goal of the global gathering was not to begin work on an international framework for regulating AI.",
      "\u201cThe summit is not to talk about rules and regulations. The summit is to find where are the areas, where there are coalitions of the willing to develop things, for example, common principles or goals for AI,\u201d she said.",

      "An American woman who claims Andrew and Tristan Tate attempted to recruit her into a webcam sex trafficking ring filed a countersuit against the social media personalities on Monday, claiming they defamed her after she gave a testimony to Romanian authorities.",
      "The civil complaint was filed in a circuit court in Palm Beach County, Florida, by a woman identified in court documents as Jane Doe.",
      "The brothers, who have been fighting criminal cases in Romania and the U.K., have been accused of human trafficking, money laundering and sex crimes. They have denied all allegations against them.",
      "Jane Doe\u2019s countersuit comes after the Tate brothers sued her for defamation in 2023, accusing her and another woman of giving fabricated evidence to Romanian authorities and conspiring to defraud and falsely imprison them.",
      "But Jane Doe has been \u201crelentlessly harassed, threatened, and sued for merely cooperating with Romanian authorities,\u201d her attorney Dani Pinter, senior vice president at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAndrew and Tristan Tate have worked to ruin her life by suing her and her parents \u2014 an abuse of the legal system and blatant witness intimidation,\u201d Pinter said. \u201cToday, she is fighting back against this use of lawfare and her counterclaim against the Tate brothers shows that she will not be intimidated by their attempts to silence her.\u201d",
      "Alleging that the brothers\u2019 actions have caused her severe emotional distress, Jane Doe now seeks financial compensation at an amount to be determined at trial, as well as a court order prohibiting the Tate brothers from \u201ccontacting, harassing, or defaming\u201d her.",
      "Jane Doe\u2019s suit is the first U.S.-based lawsuit against the Tate brothers, who are both former kickboxers and dual U.S.-British citizens.",
      "They were indicted in Romania in June 2023 on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women \u2014 allegations they have denied. In December, a Romanian appeals court sent the case back to prosecutors for further review instead of putting it to trial, citing flaws in the indictment.",
      "Andrew Tate, 38, a divisive social media personality known for his extreme rhetoric on women and masculinity, was temporarily placed under house arrest in August as Romanian prosecutors investigated a separate set of allegations, which include human trafficking of minors, sex with a minor and money laundering.",
      "He and Tristan Tate, 36, had been previously detained in Romania on allegations of sexual aggression in another old U.K. case. A Romanian court has approved their extradition to the U.K. once the brothers finish trial in Romania. The brothers are being monitored in Romania under judicial control, as their house arrest was lifted last month.",
      "Andrew and Tristan Tate\u2019s lawyer, Joseph McBride, said he is \u201cpleased\u201d with the progress of the Tates\u2019 defamation suit against Jane Doe, which has yet to go to trial.",
      "\u201cDiscovery is progressing in our case. The facts and law strongly support our claims. We look forward to the trial,\u201d McBride wrote in an email, adding that her countersuit is a \u201cpoorly constructed and desperate attempt to relitigate the failed Romanian criminal case in a U.S. court,\u201d referring to the case that was sent back to prosecutors.",
      "\u201cShockingly, NCOSE has blatantly disregarded Judge Curley\u2019s order to seal the Romanian indictment by copying and pasting large sections of the Romanian indictment into their flawed lawsuit,\u201d McBride wrote. \u201cWe will be seeking sanctions immediately.\u201d",
      "Jane Doe alleges that she was lured by Tristan Tate from Florida to Romania under the pretense of a romantic relationship.",
      "The two met online in late 2021 when Jane Doe was 20 years old, according to her lawsuit. Tristan Tate flew Jane Doe out to live with him in Romania and he imposed a set of rules on her, the lawsuit alleges, including one forbidding her from talking to anyone Tate didn\u2019t introduce her to.",
      "The lawsuit also cited alleged instances of Tristan Tate seemingly pressuring Jane Doe to create sexual content on OnlyFans, a subscription-based exclusive content platform popular with sex workers. It noted that he appeared to accept when she finally told him she didn\u2019t want to do so.",
      "She was living in a house with other women, all of whom were supposedly in a relationship with either Andrew or Tristan Tate, according to the lawsuit, which added that many of them appeared to be working \u201cvery long hours\u201d on their OnlyFans. After realizing that she hardly saw Tristan Tate despite having talked about spending time together, Jane Doe began getting worried she was \u201clured to Romania on false pretenses.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also alleged one woman told Jane Doe that she feared she \u201cwould end up dead\u201d if she told anyone the things she knew about the Tate brothers, and another woman told Jane Doe that she had not been paid for some work she had done for the Tates on TikTok. This and other observations, the lawsuit stated, made Jane Doe suspect that trafficking was occurring."

      "\u201cThey broke down my door at 4 in the morning,\u201d said Odelyn St. Fleur, who had worked as a mason in the Dominican Republic for two decades. He had been sleeping next to his wife and 7-year-old son.",

      "Despite the crackdown, many re-enter the Dominican Republic, exposing a broken system.",

      "Dominican officials argue that Haitian immigrants have overburdened the country\u2019s public services, with more than 80,000 new Haitian students enrolled in public schools in the past four years.

      "BUENOS AIRES \u2014 Carlos Kambourian, an Argentine pediatrician who is gay, counted himself as a supporter of President Javier Milei\u2019s libertarian economic reforms. That was until the outspoken right-wing leader appeared to associate homosexuality with sexual abuse in a speech last month.",
      "Milei, an economist and former media pundit who won a shock election in 2023, has received widespread plaudits from economists and\u00a0investors\u00a0for his\u00a0tough economic measures\u00a0that have helped overturn a\u00a0deep fiscal deficit, revved up markets and eased triple-digit inflation.",
      "But his strongly conservative social views are proving more divisive in a country that has blazed a trail for regional liberal reforms. He is anti-feminist, opposes abortion and has railed against the \u201cwoke agenda\u201d \u2014 a term for a focus on racial and social justice but which is often used by conservatives to disparage progressive policies.",
      "In a speech at Davos, he cited a story about a U.S. gay couple jailed for abusing their adopted children, saying that \u201cin its most extreme versions, gender ideology constitutes child abuse, plain and simple. They are pedophiles.\u201d",
      "Gender ideology is a loose term often used by conservative groups to reference ideas that promote non-traditional views on sex and gender. Rights activists view the term as dehumanizing and an anti-LGBTQ and anti-feminist trope.",

      "While Milei has faced fierce anti-austerity protests, data from local pollster Opina Argentina and consultancy Analogias show just over half of Argentines back Milei overall and his\u00a0handling of the economy.",
      "But only 40% support his views on homosexuality versus 50% against, according to Opina, and the plan to remove femicide from the penal code had 51% disapproval versus 43% in favor. At the same time,\u00a0only 44% of people supported the recent march.",

    "story": [
      "It could have been an explosive discovery. But luckily, more than 170 World War II bombs lying underneath a children's playground in northeastern England did not go off, and workers were able to recover them.",
      "Construction workers found the first bomb when they began work on the Scotts Park playground in the small town of Wooler last month, Kerren Rodgers, a spokesperson for the local Parish Council, told NBC News on Tuesday. Since then, she said, 176 bombs had been recovered.",
      "Describing the find as \u201cunexpected,\u201d the council said in a news release Friday that bomb disposal experts Brimstone Site Investigations had been called in to search the site for more explosives.",
      "On their first day, they uncovered 65 practice bombs, each weighing 10 pounds, in an area just over 10 square feet, the release said.",
      "\u201cWhilst this ordnance is described as practice bombs, they do still carry a charge,\u201d the release said. By the end of the second day, a further 90 practice bombs had been recovered, it added.",
      "Given the numbers involved, the bombs needed \u201cto be recovered by professionals to satisfy all concerned that the playpark area is once again safe for contractors and ultimately users of the equipment,\u201d the release said.",
      "Rodgers, the council spokesperson, said, \u201cOur main concern is to make the site completely safe and to restart the installation of the fully inclusive playground as soon as practical.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Brimstone Site Investigations said that its team of engineers was working on-site to safely remove and dispose of all the bombs but that it was unable to provide further comment for safety and operational reasons until the job was completed. The spokesperson did not say when that might be.",
      "In a separate interview with the BBC, Councillor Mark Mather\u00a0said the area may have been used as a Home Guard training ground where army officers went from across the country.",
      "\u201cAfter the war, it looked like they just buried all the ordnance in one of the pits,\u201d he said.",
      "It is far from the first time that unexploded World War II ordnance has been discovered in Britain.",
      "In what the Defense Ministry called \u201cone of the largest U.K. peacetime evacuation operations,\u201d thousands of people were told to leave their homes in the southwestern city of Plymouth after an unexploded bomb was discovered in a garden last February.",
      "Authorities transported the device, which weighed just over 1,000 pounds, through the city before they detonated it at sea.",
      "Farther north, in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh, three unexploded bombs dropped during a German raid in 1940 remain buried under the city's\u00a0streets, according to the police archives.",
      "So far, only a third of the children's park in Wooler has been cleared as officials continue excavations to ensure no more ordnance is hidden underneath.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite something to think the children have been playing on bombs, and it\u2019s been a really challenging situation,\" Mather said."

      "BERLIN \u2014 Many countries had their worst showing in more than a decade in an index released Tuesday that serves as a barometer of public sector corruption worldwide, from leading powers such as the United States and France to authoritarian nations such as Russia and Venezuela.",
      "Transparency International, which compiles the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, found that 47 countries out of the 180 it surveyed had their lowest score last year since it started using its current methodology for its global ranking in 2012. It said of its 2024 survey that \u201cglobal corruption levels remain alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering.\u201d",
      "The group also pointed to worldwide risks from corruption to efforts to combat climate change. It said that a lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms increases the risk of climate funds being embezzled or misused, while \u201cundue influence,\u201d often from the private sector, obstructs the approval of ambitious policies.",

It ranks 180 countries and territories on a scale from a \u201chighly corrupt\u201d 0 to a \u201cvery clean\u201d 100.",
      "The global average remained unchanged from 2023 at 43, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring under 50, Transparency International said. Denmark held on to first place with an unchanged 90 points, followed by Finland with 88 and Singapore with 84. New Zealand dropped from third to fourth, shedding two points to 83.",
      "South Sudan slid to the bottom of the index with just eight points, displacing Somalia although the latter country\u2019s score dropped to nine. They were followed by Venezuela with 10 and Syria with 12.",
      "The U.S. slid from 69 points to 65 and from 24th place to 28th. Transparency International pointed to criticism of its judicial branch. It noted that the U.S. Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023, \u201cbut serious questions remain about the lack of meaningful, objective enforcement mechanisms and the strength of the new rules themselves.\u201d",
      "Other Western nations on the decline included France, which dropped four points to 67 and five places to 25th; and Germany, down three points to 75 and six places to 15th. It tied with Canada, which was down one point and three places.",

      "In the Middle East and North Africa, the situation of anti-corruption efforts \u201cremains bleak\u201d as political leaders exert near-absolute control while benefiting from wealth and clamping down on dissent, the group said. But it said that \u201cunforeseen opportunities are also emerging,\u201d for example in the wake of the fall of President Bashar Assad\u2019s government in Syria.
