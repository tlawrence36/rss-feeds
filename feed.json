      "The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department says it\u2019s investigating a new sexual battery allegation against hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is serving a four-year prison sentence on prostitution-related convictions",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said Monday it's investigating a new sexual battery allegation against hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is serving a four-year prison sentence on prostitution-related convictions.",
      "A male music producer and publicist said he was asked to come to a photo shoot in 2020 at a Los Angeles warehouse, where Combs exposed himself while masturbating and told the accuser to assist, according to NBC News, citing a police report. Combs then tossed a dirty shirt at the man, the producer said.",
      "The accuser, whose name is redacted in the police report, said he did not tell anyone for several years because he felt embarrassed. He came forward to police in Largo, Florida, this September, shortly after Combs was convicted on other charges.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyer did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment on the latest allegations.",
      "The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said it received an official copy of the report from the Florida department on Friday, and will be investigating the allegations.",

      "He is set to be released in May 2028, though he can earn reductions in his time behind bars through his participation in substance abuse treatment and other prison programs.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cThat \u201970s Show\u201d actor Danny Masterson filed a petition Monday for his two rape convictions and long prison sentence to be thrown out, saying that his trial lawyer failed to call key witnesses and introduce essential evidence that might have exonerated him.",
      "The petition for habeas corpus filed with California's 2nd District Court of Appeal argues that lawyer Philip Cohen did not represent Masterson properly at the 2023 retrial that ended with the actor being convicted of raping two women at his Los Angeles home in 2003. He was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.",
      "The petition also argues that the trial judge demonstrated a bias against the Church of Scientology, allowing an \u201cunconstitutional intrusion\u201d into the church's doctrine and a misinterpretation of its scripture.",
      "Masterson is a member of the church, whose practices were a major issue at his trial, and the women are former members.",
      "The petition says that Cohen spoke to only two of the 20 potential witnesses brought to his attention by his co-counsel and an investigator. It says the witnesses included some who would have testified that the women spoke favorably of the sexual relationships they had with Masterson. And they included psychological and pharmacological experts who would have testified about the effects of alcohol and drugs on memory.",
      "The court filing says there was \u201cunexpected and unreasonable failure of trial counsel to present any of the mountain of exculpatory evidence\u201d that had been amassed by Masterson's pretrial attorney Shawn Holley, and the result was a violation of his constitutional rights.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine F. Olmedo declined to delay Masterson\u2019s first trial to accommodate Holley\u2019s representation of former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer against his own allegations of sexual misconduct. Cohen then took over as lead attorney.",
      "Masterson's first trial ended in a mistrial with a jury unable to reach consensus on any of three rape counts against him. He was promptly retried, and a jury found him guilty of two counts while failing to reach a verdict on the third.",

      "The Metropolitan Museum of Art has announced its next spring fashion exhibit",
      "NEW YORK -- If there's been one uniting theme of all the blockbuster fashion exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it\u2019s the simple idea that fashion is art.",
      "\u201cCostume Art,\u201d announced Monday as the next big show at the museum\u2019s Costume Institute \u2014 launched by the starry Met Gala in 2026 \u2014 aims to make that connection more literal than ever, pairing garments with objects from across the museum to show how fashion has long been intertwined with different art forms.",
      "Max Hollein, CEO and director of the Met, said in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement that he hopes the exhibit will take visitors to the New York museum on a (very fashionable) journey through art history, where they will see connections throughout.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a show that can really live in fascinating ways at the museum and can pull from all different areas of our collection \u2014 paintings, sculpture, drawings,\u201d Hollein said.",
      "\u201cI hope we all agree that fashion is art,\u201d Hollein added. \u201cBut actually I think the exhibition \u2026 will make it obvious how fashion is actually happening, so to say, all across the museum and in all different mediums already.\u201d",
      "The new show will examine the dressed body, and will be organized thematically by different body types, according to the Costume Institute's curator in charge, Andrew Bolton. It will include the \u201cNaked Body\u201d and the \u201cClassical Body,\u201d for example, but also less expected themes like the \u201cPregnant Body\u201d and the \u201cAging Body.\u201d",
      "The connections that will be drawn between artworks and garments will range, curators said in a statement, \u201cfrom the formal to the conceptual, the aesthetic to the political, the individual to the universal, the illustrative to the symbolic, and the playful to the profound.\u201d",
      "One example: in the \u201cNaked Body\u201d section, a 1504 print from German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer will be paired with spandex bodysuits by Belgian designer Walter Van Beirendonck from a 2009 collection that revisits the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.",

      "\u201cMaking movies is not what I do, it's who I am,\u201d said Cruise. He was composed as always, but at moments seemed near tears as he spoke, grasping the gold honorary statuette that celebrated his more than 40 years at the apex of the industry at the film academy's annual Governors Awards.",
      "\u201cIn that theater we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together,\u201d he said after a two-minute ovation.",
      "Production designer Wynn Thomas and choreographer and actor Debbie Allen were also selected by the academy's board of governors to be honored for their storied careers, and an absent Dolly Parton was honored for a lifetime of philanthropy at the ceremony at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Los Angeles.",
      "A competitive Oscar has eluded Cruise, who's been nominated four times: as an actor for 1989\u2019s \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d 1996\u2019s \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia,\u201d and as a producer for 2022\u2019s \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis may be his first Oscar,\u201d I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said, \u201cbut from what I have seen and experienced, this will not be the last.\u201d",

      "His record label said Saturday in a statement posted to his social media accounts that Snider died Friday.",
      "\u201cWhere do we find the words for the one who always had the right words, who knew how to distill everything down to its essence with words and song while delivering the most devastating, hilarious, and impactful turn of phrases?\u201d the statement read. \u201cAlways creating rhyme and meter that immediately felt like an old friend or a favorite blanket. Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.\u201d",
      "Snider's family and friends had said in a Friday statement that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a hospital in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and that his situation had since grown more complicated and he was transferred elsewhere. The diagnosis came on the heels of the cancellation of a tour after Snider had been the victim of a violent assault in the Salt Lake City area, according to a Nov. 3 statement from his management team.",
      "But Salt Lake City police later arrested Snider himself when he at first refused to leave a hospital and later returned and threatened staffers, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.",
      "The scrapped tour was in support of his most recent album, \u201cHigh, Lonesome and Then Some,\u201d which released in October. Snider combined elements of folk, rock and country in a three-decade career. In reviews of his recent albums, The Associated Press called him a \u201csinger-songwriter with the persona of a fried folkie\u201d and a \u201cstoner troubadour and cosmic comic.\u201d",
      "He modeled himself on \u2014 and at times met and was mentored by \u2014 artists like Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark and John Prine. His songs were recorded by artists including Jerry Jeff Walker, Billy Joe Shaver and Tom Jones. And he co-wrote a song with Loretta Lynn that appeared on her 2016 album, \u201cFull Circle.\u201d",

      "Before Friday, the most the association had paid for an artifact was $1.5 million for \u201cThe Builders,\u201d by African American artist Jacob Lawrence, in 2007, McBride said. That work depicts hard-working men in orange, red and brown tones, and hangs in the White House Green Room.",
      "The sketches sold Friday are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, according to Heritage Auctions, the Dallas-based auction house that sold them. The series was created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post.",

It\u2019s the first clue that the costumes on the female-driven comedy are taking center stage.",
      "The Apple TV show made a splash in its first season with the starry cast, high production values and ubiquitous grasshopper cocktail. Wiig\u2019s character, Maxine, tries to break into Palm Beach high society in 1969 and bumps heads with co-stars Carol Burnett, Allison Janney, Leslie Bibb and Laura Dern.

      "For Season 2, which premiered this week, Emmy-winning costume designer Alix Friedberg says she and her team coordinated \u201cthousands\u201d of looks that reflect the characters\u2019 jet-setting style. She says 50-60% of the brightly colored and graphic print costumes are original vintage designer pieces, sourced by shoppers and costume designers.",

      "If not original vintage, Friedberg\u2019s team builds the costumes, and if a character has to wear an outfit in multiple scenes or in big dance numbers, the team may create duplicates to preserve continuity. Friedberg says she was lucky to find so many vendors with vintage designer pieces in great condition.",
      "\u201c(Bibb\u2019s character) Dinah wears a few original Oscar de la Renta pieces that are really so perfect. Bill Blass was a big one, Oleg Cassini,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThere\u2019s a dress that (Janney\u2019s character) Evelyn wears that's this all emerald green jersey, it\u2019s an original Halston and it\u2019s so stunning on her and it really does sort of evoke what\u2019s to come in the '70s.\u201d",
      "Janney calls Friedberg \u201cbrilliant\u201d and marveled at her talent at finding pieces that are like works of art. Some of her favorites were the characters\u2019 apr\u00e8s-ski looks in the Swiss Alps \u2014 but she finds it hard to pick an ultimate favorite.",
      "\u201cAll of them just make me feel divine. And the hair is just a masterpiece, and the makeup \u2014 it all goes together to just create Evelyn and I barely have to do anything,\u201d Janney says.",
      "The costumes also help heighten the comedy. Friedberg says Evelyn\u2019s stoic and deadpan character elicits laughs with some of her over-the-top getups.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s delivering this dialogue, these lines with, like, seven wigs on top of her,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThe absurdity comes out really in how these women present themselves time and time again. \u2026 It was just so much fun to get to laugh and wink at the audience.\u201d",
      "Burnett called costume fittings on the show \u201cgreat fun\u201d and said they helped her find her character, the scheming Norma. \u201cI work from the outside in. I have to know what I\u2019m going to look like,\u201d she says.",

      "The BBC has apologized to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, but said it strongly disagreed that there was a basis for a defamation lawsuit",
      "LONDON -- The BBC has issued a public apology to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, but said it \u201cstrongly disagreed there is a basis for a defamation claim.\u201d",
      "Since it was established more than a century ago, Britain's public broadcaster has been no stranger to controversy. Over the past week, it has been embroiled in one of its deepest-ever crisis as its director general stepped down, its head of news quit, questions were raised over the veracity of its journalism and Trump said he is mulling a billion-dollar lawsuit.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Pressure on the broadcaster has been growing since the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier compiled by the BBC's adviser on standards and guidelines on Nov. 3.",
      "As well as criticizing the BBC\u2019s coverage of transgender issues and raising concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service, the dossier said that an edition of the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs series \u201cPanorama\" \u2014 titled \u201cTrump: A Second Chance?\u201d \u2014 broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election was misleading.",
      "Specifically, it showed how the third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the Jan. 6, 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "By doing so, it made it look like Trump was giving the green light to his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.",
      "The outcry from opponents of the BBC \u2014 and there are many both in the U.K. and abroad \u2014 was immediate and vociferous.",

      "The White House Historical Association is hoping to reclaim a series of sketches by American painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell that once hung in the West Wing",
      "WASHINGTON -- The White House Historical Association is bidding to reclaim a series of sketches by American painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell that once hung in the West Wing but ended up at auction after a family dispute over their ownership.",
      "The association could face some stiff competition as the opening bid is $2.5 million and auction house clients have been lining up with offers.",
      "The four 1940s-era sketches are titled \u201cSo You Want to See the President!\u201d and depict people from all walks of life hanging out in the White House lobby as they anticipate meeting President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were put up for sale by a grandson of the White House official who received them as a gift from Rockwell after a court battle over their ownership was settled.",
      "The sketches are set to be sold by a Dallas-based auction house Friday. In keeping with its mission to help the White House collect and display artifacts that represent American history and culture, including the history of the White House, the association hopes to prevail. It wants to add the drawing to the vast White House collection of art, furniture and other items.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re so different from any of the other art that was exhibited in the West Wing,\u201d said Anita McBride, who sits on the association's board of directors.",
      "McBride remembers seeing the drawings in 1981 when she went to work in Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. They were a \u201cfocal point\u201d when staffers took visitors on tours, she said. \u201cPeople just loved seeing\u201d the \u201cwide array and depiction of Americans that have access to their president.\u201d",
      "The series, created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post during World War II, \u201coffers an intimate and deeply human portrayal of American democracy in action,\u201d according to a description on the Heritage Auctions website.",
      "The sketches show a variety of people \u2014 journalists, military officers and even a Miss America Pageant winner and her publicist \u2014 waiting on plush-looking red chairs in the West Wing lobby as they waited to meet Roosevelt. A Secret Service agent stands watch in one of the scenes.",
      "\u201cIn a way, it sort of illustrates how FDR always talked about the \u2018arsenal of democracy\u2019 and what made the United States unique,\u201d said Matthew Costello, the association\u2019s chief education officer. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible series of renderings.\u201d",
      "The sketches are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, the auction house said.",
      "Rockwell gave the original drawings to Stephen Early, who was Roosevelt's longtime press secretary, seen in a drawing smoking a pipe as reporters huddle around him. A family member turned them over to the White House in 1978, and they were on display throughout the West Wing for more than four decades, sometimes in a hallway between the press offices that are mere steps from the Oval Office.",

      "William Elam III, a grandson of Stephen Early's, said his mother received the drawings as a gift from her father, the former press secretary, before he died, and that ownership had later passed to him.",
      "The illustrations had gone to the White House in 1978 under an agreement which obligated the White House to return them to Elam upon request. The White House gave back the drawings in 2022.",
      "A federal appeals court settled the dispute in May, upholding a lower-court ruling in favor of Elam, according to court records.",
      "Bidding will start at $2.5 million and clients are \u201cready and waiting to compete for this American icon,\u201d Christina Rees, director of communications for Heritage Auctions, said in an email. The auction house has estimated the drawings will sell for between $4 million and $6 million.",
      "That price tag could present a hurdle for the White House Historical Association, which was created in 1961 by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy to help preserve the museum quality of the interior of the White House and educate the public. It is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that receives no government funding. It raises money mostly through private donations and merchandise sales, including an annual Christmas ornament.",
      "The association did not reveal how much it is willing to spend, but the most it has ever paid for a painting in the past was $1.5 million for \u201cThe Builders,\u201d by African American artist Jacob Lawrence, in 2007, McBride said. That work depicts hard-working men in orange, red and brown tones, and hangs in the White House Green Room.",
      "McBride said she expected stiff competition for Rockwell's work because of the broad interest in Americana, as well as the artist's work. But the association's mission is to go after art, furniture and other items it believes belong in the White House.",

Don\u2019t waste your time on the people who don\u2019t,\u201d Coppola recalled Wednesday night in New York at the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit, where she was being honored for her films.",

      "But it's a distinction that was hard earned. Just over 27 years after her father Francis Ford Coppola encouraged her to make her first short film, Coppola reflected on starting a filmmaking career at a time when she was thought of as \u201ca nepo baby before they were charming\u201d and \u201cthe amateur actress who had single-handedly ruined \u2018The Godfather\u2019 films.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost people didn\u2019t think I had something to say that mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I found a few who did.\u201d",
      "Since making her feature debut with \u201cThe Virgin Suicides,\u201d Coppola has written and directed seven narrative features and one documentary, about Marc Jacobs, that A24 plans to release next year. She's been both celebrated, winning an Oscar for writing \u201cLost in Translation,\u201d which also earned her a best director nomination, and dismissed. \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d was infamously booed at Cannes, but over the next 20 years would become beloved and celebrated.",
      "Fanning remembered meticulously planning her outfit to meet Coppola for the first time at age 11, where she would go on to be cast as the daughter of a famous movie star in \u201cSomewhere.\u201d A few years prior she had convinced her grandmother to take her to see \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d and she immediately became a fan.",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Lotfy Nathan has turned the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Thomas into a supernatural thriller called \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d starring Nicolas Cage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- In the second century, as the canonical Gospels were being copied and circulated throughout the Roman Empire, another text about the life of Jesus was simultaneously spreading. Although the Infancy Gospel of Thomas didn\u2019t make it into the New Testament, it remained popular among Christians for centuries.",
      "When filmmaker Lotfy Nathan was introduced to the apocryphal text about Jesus\u2019 childhood by his history-loving father, he immediately began poring over it as a springboard for what would eventually become \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d the supernatural thriller starring Nicolas Cage and opening in theaters Friday.",
      "\u201cThe thought gave me chills,\u201d recalled the writer and director, who was raised Coptic Orthodox. \u201cThe novelty of this, in a way, being an origin story that hadn\u2019t been told before.\u201d",
      "The film, which stars FKA twigs and Noah Jupe alongside Cage, follows Jesus as a young boy being tempted by Satan to rebel against his father, Joseph (Cage). The film\u2019s source material is established with an opening title card. \u201cBased on the Infancy Gospel of Thomas,\u201d it reads. But Nathan concedes he couldn\u2019t rely solely on the text and had to fill in narrative gaps, as with a storyline involving Satan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s written like a laundry list of events. It doesn\u2019t really have an arc, so to speak,\u201d he said of the apocryphal account of Jesus\u2019 life from ages 5 to 12. \u201cI had a historian pull a lot of research for me before I wrote the first draft.\u201d",
      "As fate would have it, Cage had already read the Infancy Gospel of Thomas years ago, during a period in his life of deep philosophical curiosity and reflection. When Nathan came to the Oscar winner with the script, Cage said he saw a through line to a type of story he\u2019s long been attracted to.",
      "\u201cFamily dramas, it\u2019s no secret, is one of my favorite subject matters or genres. I couldn\u2019t think of a more compelling family dynamic than the Nativity,\u201d Cage told The Associated Press. \u201cAs I read it and thought about it, I never thought of it as a horror film per se. I saw it as a family drama about an existential crisis.\u201d",
      "The Infancy Gospel of Thomas might seem novel and obscure for some contemporary audiences, but history attests to both its popularity and longevity, according to Tony Burke, a professor at York University in Toronto whose specialties include early Christian apocrypha.",
      "Stories within it permeated ancient Christian lore, art and even some medieval plays. One account from the text about Jesus giving life to clay birds even made its way into the Quran.",
      "Also referred to as the Paidika \u2014 a nod to its original Greek title, \u201cPaidika Iesou,\u201d which translates to \u201cThe Childhood Acts of Jesus\u201d \u2014 the Infancy Gospel of Thomas often surprises modern readers.",
      "\u201cThis is not the Jesus that they expect \u2014 a Jesus that kills a boy in the marketplace or strikes down his teacher,\u201d Burke said, though he argues that Christian audiences during that time wouldn\u2019t have been bothered by this characterization. \u201cIn the ancient world, it was not that uncommon to tell stories of revered holy men cursing as well as blessing.\u201d",

      "The Paidika is one of two primary infancy gospels from that time \u2014 the other being the Infancy Gospel of James \u2014 that were popular among early Christians. \u201cThey never became canonical in the strict sense, but they were always kind of something on the periphery,\u201d Burke said.",
      "Although Jesus movies aren't often described as horror films or supernatural thrillers, the second century text upon which \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d is based is \u201cquite disturbing,\u201d argues Joan E. Taylor, a professor of early Christianity at King\u2019s College London. She recently wrote \u201cBoy Jesus: Growing Up Judaean in Turbulent Times.\u201d",
      "\u201cJesus is portrayed as having these powers but not really having the moral compass in terms of how he uses his powers, or at least not the moral compass we would expect from, say, the Gospel of Luke,\u201d she said of the Paidika. \u201cYou have this child who has these supernatural powers and punishes those who come in his way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d isn\u2019t the only recent film to reimagine the apocryphal gospel. \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d the 2016 drama based upon Anne Rice's novel \u201cChrist the Lord: Out of Egypt,\u201d also pulls from the Paidika.",
      "Both films reinterpret some of the aspects of the text that are ostensibly at odds with the Jesus of the canonical Gospels. In \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d for example, it\u2019s Satan who kills the boy in the marketplace, then frames Jesus. That encounter is left out of \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d entirely.",

      "Fans of Danmei same-sex romance stories in China say the government is cracking down harder than ever on the popular genre",
      "For Cindy Zhong, like many young Chinese women, a relaxing night used to mean curling up with a steamy story about two men in love. Then her favorite authors, and their tales, started disappearing.",
      "Fans of the popular Danmei same-sex romance genre, written and read mainly by straight women, say the Chinese government is carrying out the largest crackdown yet on it, effectively neutering the enjoyment.",
      "In the vast world of fantasy, Danmei is relatively straightforward: Two men stand in for idealized relationships, from chaste to erotic. Some scholars believe the stories appeal to Chinese women as a way to sidestep the country\u2019s conservative gender values and imagine relationships on a more equal footing.",
      "\"Women turn to Danmei for pure love, especially as they face pressure from families, peers and society to get married and have kids,\u201d said Aiqing Wang, a senior lecturer at the University of Liverpool who studies Chinese popular culture and internet literature.",
      "The once-niche Chinese literary subculture has seen a boom in recent years, with novels adapted into blockbuster television series and translated into Western languages.",
      "Danmei \u2014 also known as \u201cBoys Love\u201d in English \u2014 has also caught the eye of Chinese authorities. At least dozens of writers have been interrogated, arrested and charged with producing and selling obscene materials in China in the past year, according to media reports and witness accounts online.",
      "Some writers have stopped publishing or taken work offline. Websites have shut down or removed many stories, leaving the tamest behind.",
      "\u201cChinese female readers can no longer find a safe, uncensored space to place our desires,\u201d said Zhong, an educator in her 30s.",
      "Writers have said they enjoy directing lives that aren\u2019t their own.",
      "\u201cWhen I was writing, I felt so powerful that I could create a world,\u201d said Zou Xuan, a teacher who used to write Danmei for fun and has been reading them for a decade.",
      "China\u2019s government has been tightening its grip on the LGBTQ+ community, shutting down rights groups and social media accounts, despite removing homosexuality from its list of mental illness in 2001. Same-sex relationships are not criminalized.",
      "Even though China\u2019s censorship apparatus has long disapproved of same-sex love stories, the most popular Danmei stories have become bestselling books and been adapted into cartoons, video games and TV series. Adaptations often get around censorship by changing the characters to a heterosexual couple or presenting the relationship between male leads as an intense \u201cfriendship.\u201d",
      "The stories, usually published online by amateurs, are some of the most widely read fiction in China. Ranging from the flowery to the heavily erotic, they can include scenes of men fighting with a sword and a flute in ethereal ancient costumes or sex scenes in nature after rainfall.",
      "Danmei is \u201ca utopian existence,\u201d said Chen Xingyu, a 32-year-old freelance teacher living in the southwestern city of Kunming. \u201cI would be less happy without it.\u201d",
      "Some of the most popular stories, such as Heaven Official\u2019s Blessing and Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation, have been translated into English, building a global fan base and cracking The New York Times paperback bestseller list.",
      "The stories' language \"is very flowery and poetic, which I really enjoy,\u201d said Kayla McHenry, who works in a law firm in Pennsylvania and reads stories in translation.",

      "The disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers submitted sworn affidavits last month from two jurors who said they regretted voting to convict Weinstein and only did so because others on the panel bullied them during five contentious days of deliberations.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said the jurors\u2019 claims were \u201cinconsistent and implausible\u201d and that they provided no legal basis for Weinstein\u2019s lawyers to challenge his conviction.",
      "One juror who claimed in an affidavit that he observed \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d had told the judge during deliberations that he only saw \u201cplayground stuff,\" prosecutors said.

      "Weinstein\u2019s bid to overturn his first-degree criminal sex act conviction \u201cutterly fails, on both the law and the facts, to meet the standard necessary to set aside the guilty verdict,\u201d prosecutors Matthew Colangelo, Nicole Blumberg, Shannon Lucey and Becky Mangold wrote.",
      "They cited a centuries-old rule that the U.S. Supreme Court has said gives \u201csubstantial protection to verdict finality\u201d and assures that once a trial is over, jurors won\u2019t be \"harassed or annoyed by litigants seeking to challenge the verdict.\u201d",

      "One of the jurors said she was screamed at in the jury room and told, \u201cwe have to get rid of you.\u201d The other juror said anyone who doubted Weinstein\u2019s guilt was grilled by other jurors and that if he could have voted by secret ballot, \u201cI would have returned a not guilty verdict on all three charges.\u201d",
      "\u201cI regret the verdict,\u201d that juror said. \u201cWithout the intimidation from other jurors, I believe that the jury would have hung on the Miriam Haley charge.\u201d",

      "Meghan Trainor will release her seventh studio album in April",
      "NEW YORK -- In the decade following her debut album, Meghan Trainor has lived myriad lives \u2014 but the message of her bright, cheery pop music has remained the same: Stay true to who you are and ignore the haters. That spirit endures on her lead single, the jovial \u201cStill Don't Care,\u201d the first tease of her forthcoming seventh full-length album, \u201cToy with Me,\u201d out April 24.",
      "And in true Trainor fashion, \u201cStill Don't Care\u201d was inspired by real life situations. \u201cI was seeing a lot of hate all over the world, but I was getting a lot of hate when I started posting more pictures of ... my fitness journey and my health journey. And I didn\u2019t really expect that,\u201d Trainor told The Associated Press. \u201cI would get really upset at comments and I was like, \u2018I wish I didn\u2019t feel like this. I wish I didn\u2019t give them so much power.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd so, when I write songs, I always write in the perspective of how I wish I thought, like \u2018All About That Bass.\u2019 I didn\u2019t feel like that when I wrote it,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd all my self-love anthems. But when I perform them and I see how it affects other people, I start believing them.\u201d",
      "\u201cStill Don't Care\u201d is yet another example, with its maximalist, \u201880s pop production and choir courtesy of Pentatonix\u2019s Scott Hoying. Her mom, brother and sister-in-law contribute background vocals on it as well \u2014 perhaps softening the song's gloves-up approach to combating online hate. \u201cYou could tear me apart,\u201d Trainor sings. \u201cBut I sleep well at night.\u201d",
      "It's the first taste of \u201cToy with Me,\u201d which Trainor teases will have a few self-love bops, songs to excise her anger through and lots of familial love. \u201cThe only features I have right now in this moment are my kids, Riley and Barry, because I wrote them a beautiful song, the only, like, slower song. It\u2019s called \u2018Little One' and it's about how I wish they could stay little forever,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWhen I play it, Riley goes, \u2018Oh, this is my song. Play my song!' It\u2019s literally my lullaby for them. And at the end of the song they say, \u2018I love you, Mama,\u2019 and it\u2019s just the cutest thing ever. And that\u2019s when everyone\u2019s crying.\u201d",
      "Trainor said she worked on the album for eight months. \u201cI exhausted myself, and I went a little too hard. I got excited to be home with the kids and work on my songs, but then I definitely, I overdid it, and my body started doing weird things, giving me signals. Like, my tongue started burning one day. And I was like, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 And it wouldn\u2019t go away forever. And the dentist was like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re stressed,\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Songwriting, too, was a challenge. \u201cI usually write a song in one day and I\u2019m done with it, but each song on this album took, like, months to finish,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that was the only difference from this album than any other album I\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "That 2003 film, directed by Edward Zwick, starred Tom Cruise as the samurai hero. It was a big hit, including in Japan, and it helped Japan\u2019s own stars like Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada in their Hollywood careers.",

      "\u201cWe took the want-to approach, keeping in mind that, while thoroughly studying jidaigeki, we were going to do what we want to make, and make something that looked absolutely cool,\u201d Okada told The Associated Press.",
      "Okada is a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu. He has starred in various films including \u201cThe Eternal Zero,\u201d about World War II Zero pilots, directed by Takashi Yamazaki, of \u201cGodzilla Minus One.\u201d",

      "Billed as \u201cThe Great Melbourne Bagpipe Bash,\u201d the eclectic performance took place in Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square, on Swanston Street, which was the scene of the Australian hard rock band\u2019s 1976 film clip in which they played the hit on the back of a flatbed truck traveling slowly through downtown traffic with music blaring from speakers.",

He had been waiting outside the concert stadium since 4:50 a.m. to ensure he\u2019d be first in when the gates opened at 5 p.m. The bagpipes record was set nearby at 5:15 p.m.",

      "A judge is set to explain why he's approving a plan for OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge is set to give his reasoning Tuesday for approving OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma's plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids.",
      "The deal calls for members of the Sackler family who own the company to pay up to $7 billion over time.",
      "Judge Sean Lane said last week that he would accept the plan, which ranks among the largest opioid settlements ever and would do something other major ones don't: Pay some victims of the crisis.",
      "Sackler family members agreed to pay up to $7 billion over 15 years, providing most of the cash involved in the settlement.",
      "The funds distributed to state, local and Native Americans is to be used mostly to address the opioid crisis, as has been the case with other opioid settlements.",
      "About $850 million of that is to go to individual victims, including children born with opioid withdrawal.",
      "People with addiction and survivors of those who died must prove they were prescribed OxyContin to participate. Those who do could receive payments of around $8,000 or around $16,000, depending on how long they received the drug and how many other people qualify. The money for individual victims is to be distributed next year.",
      "Members of the Sackler family are agreeing to give up ownership of Purdue.",
      "For them, that won't be a major change since no family member has served on Purdue' board or received money from the company since 2018. The plan calls for Purdue to be replaced with a new company, Knoa Pharma, to be controlled by a board appointed by states and with a mission of benefiting the public.",

      "The latest plan allows lawsuits against Sackler family members by those who don't opt into the deal.",
      "This time through, few parties objected to the settlement, though some people who represented themselves and who were addicted to opioids \u2014 or had loved ones who were \u2014 raised concerns during the three-day confirmation hearing last week.",

      "NEW YORK -- Over 74,000 people enrolled in experiments have been affected by the National Institutes of Health's funding cuts, according to a new report.",
      "Between the end of February and mid-August, funding ceased for 383 studies that were testing treatments for conditions including cancer, heart disease and brain disease. The cuts disproportionately impacted efforts to tackle infectious diseases like the flu, pneumonia and COVID-19, researchers found.",
      "The funding cuts likely disrupted patients' lives in different ways.",
      "Some may have signed up for trials that never began or got delayed as institutions scrambled for alternate funding. Others could have lost access to medication or been left with an unmonitored device implant.",

      "Those clinical trial cuts may also erode trust between people and the medical institutions that support them, said Jeremy Berg, a former director of an NIH institute. Patients could think twice before participating in future research projects, worried that the funding could get pulled abruptly.",

      "At the halfway point of annual United Nations climate negotiations in Brazil, it appears the talks may do more than just focus on implementing past promises, as some observers had expected",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren\u2019t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on \u201cimplementation\u201d of past promises not yet kept.",
      "Throw that out the window.",
      "The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action \u2014 on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more \u2014 including from Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2014 the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he'll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqu\u00e9, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.",
      "\u201cI think things have changed, which is a very good thing,\u201d said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there\u2019s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say that what\u2019s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you\u2019re looking at an ambition gap,\u2033 said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of expectation, there\u2019s a lot of excitement here, but there\u2019s also a lot of political signals that\u2019s been sent by President Lula.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It\u2019s almost like a staring contest,\u201d Inventor said. \u201cBut next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.\u201d",
      "Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.",
      "Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.",
      "In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn\u2019t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth's warming.",
      "Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.",
      "So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what\u2019s planned in national pledges and what\u2019s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.",
      "That's not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year\u2019s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.",
      "So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.",
      "On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.",
      "\u201cThe parties will decide how they want to proceed,\u201d do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.",

      "But they gradually drifted apart after Austin's family moved to Germany before the girls started high school. Decades passed before they recently reconnected as grown women.",
      "\u201cStrong friendships really do stay for the long haul,\" Austin, 51, said. \"Even if there are pauses in between and they fade, that doesn\u2019t mean they completely dissolve or they go forgotten. They\u2019re always there kind of lingering like a little light in the back.\u201d",

      "Years passed with occasional holiday cards and texts but few meaningful interactions. DiPasquantonio saw photos on social media of Robb skiing and traveling with other friends. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure there was so much room for me, from a distance,\u201d she said.",

      "The company that makes OxyContin, members of the Sackler family who own it and many groups that sued over its role in the opioid crisis are asking a judge to approve a settlement plan",
      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.",
      "If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter \u2014 and maybe the entire book \u2014 on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.",
      "Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.",
      "The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.",
      "This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.",
      "A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable \u2014 something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.",

About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.",
      "About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue\u2019s opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000.

      "\u201cUnlike synthetic pharmaceuticals, peptides are naturally recognized by your body,\u201d Brecka told his more than 2 million Instagram followers in February.",
      "Critics point out that the peptides for sale are often imperfect synthetics and are taken at doses much higher than any peptides in the body, raising the risk of allergic reactions and other harms.",
      "Brecka sells more than a half-dozen peptides, including ipamorelin and CJC-1295 \u2014 both of which the FDA has flagged for serious safety risks.",
      "Like other peptides sold on Brecka\u2019s website, the ipamorelin vials carry the labeling: \u201cresearch use only.\u201d",
      "The \u201cresearch use\u201d language is pervasive across the peptide space, even in forums where users trade tips for buying, dosing and \u201cstacking\u201d different drug combinations.",
      "One Facebook group instructs members what words to avoid: \u201cinstead of \u2018taking\u2019 you are \u2019researching' peptides.\u201d",
      "Lawyers who work in the field say the language is an attempt to skirt FDA regulations. The agency does not oversee chemicals that aren\u2019t intended for human use.",
      "It\u2019s often unclear whether such peptides are being produced in the U.S. by pharmacies and mislabeled for research, or whether they are being purchased from chemical manufacturers, many located in China and not subject to FDA drug quality standards.",
      "\u201cResearch-grade peptides are going to have junk in them,\u201d said Paul Knoepfler, a cellular biologist at the University of California Davis. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have chemicals used in the purification process and fragments of peptides that you don\u2019t want.\u201d",
      "On platforms like TikTok, companies in China and other countries offer to ship dozens of peptide varieties to the U.S. for as little as $5 a vial.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s actually in there?\u201d Knoepfler said. \u201cIf someone injects it under their skin, what are they getting?\"",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued over a half-dozen warning letters to businesses promoting peptides with \u201cimmune-boosting powers.\"",
      "Then in 2023, the agency added nearly 20 peptides to a list of substances that should not be compounded due to safety risks. Pharmacies violating the measure risk fines, legal action or potential loss of their state licenses.",
      "That triggered pushback from wellness entrepreneurs and compounding pharmacies, including lawsuits.",
      "One coalition, Save Peptides, warned its followers: \u201cOur basic human rights to access alternative medical care using regenerative peptides is being stripped away by the FDA.\u201d",
      "A lawsuit brought by a large compounding pharmacy alleged that regulators had skipped legally required steps when adding peptides to FDA's list of high-risk substances. The litigation forced the agency to backtrack, and the FDA late last year agreed to convene two public meetings of outside advisers to review several peptides flagged for safety risks.",
      "In each case, the experts agreed with the FDA, voting that the substances were too risky to be compounded.",
      "Some in the industry disagree.",
      "\u201cPhysicians should have every available arrow in the quiver to treat illness and, because of the FDA\u2019s inaction, they don\u2019t,\u201d said Lee Rosebush, who helped bring the lawsuit against FDA and represents a group of large compounding pharmacies.",
      "The FDA, under Kennedy's authority, recently removed a number of experts from the compounding advisory panel.",
      "That could pave the way for appointing more peptide-friendly experts who might vote to allow some of the drugs that the FDA previously barred. Alternately, the FDA could simply release a list of peptides and tell pharmacies and clinics that the agency won't enforce bans against them.",
      "For now, doctors say they are fielding more questions from patients excited about peptides and seeking prescriptions.",
      "\u201cPatients should be really asking their health care professionals: Are these medications safe long term?\u201d says Dr. Anita Gupta of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who served on FDA\u2019s compounding committee until earlier this year. \u201cThat\u2019s the question I would ask if I was a patient.\u201d",

      "Vance\u2019s words show how Kennedy, whose wrecking-ball approach to public health agencies and longstanding vaccine skepticism have made him a polarizing figure among the public and in Congress, has been embraced by the White House as a needed force for change.",
      "\u201cOf all the specific initiatives that you guys have worked on effectively, the most important thing is that your team is willing to ask questions that people in government haven't been asking in a long time,\u201d Vance told Kennedy onstage.",

      "Vance nodded to the fact that many in Kennedy\u2019s network don\u2019t come from conventional medical circles, and some have more experience in business than in health. In fact, many of the health secretary's close allies and new hires have outright rejected medical consensus on topics including vaccines and how to heal chronic disease.",

      "President Donald Trump has signed a government funding bill that ends a record 43-day shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill Wednesday night, ending a record 43-day shutdown that caused financial stress for federal workers who went without paychecks, stranded scores of travelers at airports and generated long lines at some food banks.",
      "The shutdown magnified partisan divisions in Washington as Trump took unprecedented unilateral actions \u2014 including canceling projects and trying to fire federal workers \u2014 to pressure Democrats into relenting on their demands.",
      "The Republican president blamed the situation on Democrats and suggested voters shouldn\u2019t reward the party during next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "\u201cSo I just want to tell the American people, you should not forget this,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen we come up to midterms and other things, don\u2019t forget what they\u2019ve done to our country.\u201d",
      "The signing ceremony came just hours after the House passed the measure on a mostly party-line vote of 222-209. The Senate had already passed the measure Monday.",
      "Democrats wanted to extend an enhanced tax credit expiring at the end of the year that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. They refused to go along with a short-term spending bill that did not include that priority. But Republicans said that was a separate policy fight to be held at another time.",
      "\u201cWe told you 43 days ago from bitter experience that government shutdowns don\u2019t work,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \"They never achieve the objective that you announce. And guess what? You haven\u2019t achieved that objective yet, and you\u2019re not going to.\u201d",
      "The frustration and pressures generated by the shutdown was reflected when lawmakers debated the spending measure on the House floor.",
      "Republicans said Democrats sought to use the pain generated by the shutdown to prevail in a policy dispute.",
      "\u201cThey knew it would cause pain and they did it anyway,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said.",
      "Democrats said Republicans raced to pass tax breaks earlier this year that they say mostly will benefit the wealthy. But the bill before the House Wednesday \u201cleaves families twisting in the wind with zero guarantee there will ever, ever be a vote to extend tax credits to help everyday people pay for their health care,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass.",
      "Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats would not give up on the subsidy extension even if the vote did not go their way.",
      "\u201cThis fight is not over,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d",
      "The House had not been in legislative session since Sept. 19, when it passed a short-term measure to keep the government open when the new budget year began in October. Johnson sent lawmakers home after that vote and put the onus on the Senate to act, saying House Republicans had done their job.",
      "The legislation is the result of a deal reached by eight senators who broke ranks with the Democrats after reaching the conclusion that Republicans would not bend on using a government funding to bill to extend the health care tax credits.",
      "The compromise funds three annual spending bills and extends the rest of government funding through Jan. 30. Republicans promised to hold a vote by mid-December to extend the health care subsidies, but there is no guarantee of success.",
      "The bill includes a reversal of the firing of federal workers by the Trump administration since the shutdown began. It also protects federal workers against further layoffs through January and guarantees they are paid once the shutdown is over. The bill for the Agriculture Department means people who rely on key food assistance programs will see those benefits funded without threat of interruption through the rest of the budget year.",

      "The language seems aimed at helping Republican senators pursue damages if their phone records were analyzed by the FBI as part of an investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. The provisions drew criticism from Republicans as well. Johnson said he was \u201cvery angry about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was dropped in at the last minute, and I did not appreciate that, nor did most of the House members,\u201d Johnson said, promising a vote on the matter as early as next week.",
      "The biggest point of contention, though, was the fate of the expiring enhanced tax credit that makes health insurance more affordable through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",
      "\u201cIt's a subsidy on top of a subsidy. Our friends added it during COVID,\u201d Cole said. \u201cCOVID is over. They set a date certain that the subsidies would run out. They chose the date.\"",
      "Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the enhanced tax credit was designed to give more people access to health care and no Republican voted for it.",
      "\u201cAll they have done is try to eliminate access to health care in our country. The country is catching on to them,\u201d Pelosi said.",
      "Without the enhanced tax credit, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the parties will find any common ground on health care before the December vote in the Senate. Johnson has said he will not commit to bringing it up in his chamber.",
      "Some Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19 pandemic-era tax credits as premiums will soar for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies. Some argue that the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals rather than go directly to insurance companies.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Monday that she was supportive of extending the tax credits with changes, such as new income caps. Some Democrats have signaled they could be open to that idea.",
      "House Democrats expressed great skepticism that the Senate effort would lead to a breakthrough.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said Republicans have wanted to repeal the health overhaul for the past 15 years. \u201cThat\u2019s where they\u2019re trying to go,\u201d she said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The longest government shutdown in history could conclude as soon as Wednesday, Day 43, with almost no one happy with the final result.",
      "Democrats didn't get the heath insurance provisions they demanded added to the spending deal. And Republicans, who control the levers of power in Washington, didn't escape blame, according to polls and some state and local elections that went poorly for them.",
      "The fallout of the shutdown landed on millions of Americans, including federal workers who went without paychecks and airline passengers who had their trips delayed or canceled. An interruption in nutrition assistance programs contributed to long lines at food banks and added emotional distress going into the holiday season.",
      "The agreement includes bipartisan bills worked out by the Senate Appropriations Committee to fund parts of government \u2014 food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things. All other funding would be extended until the end of January, giving lawmakers more than two months to finish additional spending bills.",
      "Here's a look at how the shutdown started and is likely to end:",
      "Democrats made several demands to win their support for a short-term funding bill, but the central one was an extension of an enhanced tax credit that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",
      "The tax credit was boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic response, again through President Joe Biden's big energy and health care bill, and it's set to expire at the end of December. Without it, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected.",
      "\u201cNever have American families faced a situation where their health care costs are set to double \u2014 double in the blink of an eye,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.",
      "While Democrats called for negotiations on the matter, Republicans said a funding bill would need to be passed first.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are ready to sit down with Democrats just as soon as they stop holding the government hostage to their partisan demands,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said.",
      "Thune eventually promised Democrats a December vote on the tax credit extension to help resolve the standoff, but many Democrats demanded a guaranteed fix, not just a vote that is likely to fail.",
      "Thune's position was much the same as the one Schumer took back in October 2013, when Republicans unsuccessfully sought to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act in exchange for funding the government. \u201cOpen up all of the government, and then we can have a fruitful discussion,\u201d Schumer said then.",
      "The first year of President Donald Trump's second term has seen more than 200,000 federal workers leave their job through firings, forced relocations or the Republican administration's deferred resignation program, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Whole agencies that don't align with the administration's priorities have been dismantled. And billions of dollars previously approved by Congress have been frozen or canceled.",
      "Democrats have had to rely on the courts to block some of Trump's efforts, but they have been unable to do it through legislation. They were also powerless to stop Trump's big tax cut and immigration crackdown bill that Republicans helped pay for by cutting future spending on safety net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP, formerly known as food stamps.",
      "The Democrats' struggles to blunt the Trump administration's priorities has prompted calls for the party's congressional leadership to take a more forceful response.",
      "Schumer experienced that firsthand after announcing in March that he would support moving ahead with a funding bill for the 2025 budget year. There was a protest at his office, calls from progressives that he be primaried in 2028 and suggestions that the Democratic Party would soon be looking for new leaders.",

      "But those negotiations did not occur, at least not with Schumer. Republicans instead worked with a small group of eight Democrats to tee up a short-term bill to fund the government generally at current levels and accused Schumer of catering to the party's left flank when he refused to go along.",
      "\u201cThe Senate Democrats are afraid that the radicals in their party will say that they caved,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at one of his many daily press conferences.",

      "At least three-quarters of Americans believe each deserves at least a \u201cmoderate\u201d share of blame, underscoring that no one was successfully evading responsibility.",
      "Both parties looked to the Nov. 4 elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere for signs of how the shutdown was influencing public opinion. Democrats took comfort in their overwhelming successes. Trump called it a \u201cbig factor, negative\" for Republicans. But it did not change the GOP's stance on negotiating. Instead, Trump ramped up calls for Republicans to end the filibuster in the Senate, which would pretty much eliminate the need for the majority party to ever negotiate with the minority.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office says that the negative impact on the economy will be mostly recovered once the shutdown ends, but not entirely. It estimated the permanent economic loss at about $11 billion for a six-week shutdown.",
      "Beyond the numbers, though, the shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Federal workers missed paychecks, causing financial and emotional stress. Travelers had their flights delayed and at times canceled. People who rely on safety net programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program saw their benefits stopped, and Americans throughout the country lined up for meals at food banks.",

      "Bangladesh\u2019s capital and major cities are calm despite a call for a nationwide shutdown by supporters of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Bangladesh's capital and major cities were calm Tuesday despite a call for a nationwide shutdown by the former ruling party of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after she was sentenced to death over her crackdown on a student uprising last year.",
      "The International Crimes Tribunal handed down death sentences in absentia to Hasina and former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan on Monday for their involvement in deadly force used against protesters last year.",
      "Hasina's former ruling Awami League party rejected the court proceedings Monday, calling it \u201ca kangaroo court\u201d and called for a nationwide shutdown the next day.",
      "Hasina\u2019s opponents clashed with police and soldiers until late Monday and attempted to use excavators to demolish the home of her father, Bangladesh independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Local media reported the home of former President Abdul Hamid, a veteran Awami League leader, was vandalized in the northeastern Kishoreganj district.",
      "But on Tuesday, there was no closure of services or shops and schools, although some people expressed tension and confusion over what lies ahead for the South Asian nation, a parliamentary democracy of 170 million people.",
      "Mohammad Saikot Hossain, a Dhaka businessman, said there is \u201cno real rule of law here\u201d and he worries about his children\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cThose who ruled the country before shaped the law in their own way, and those who are ruling now are also shaping the law in their own way,\" he said. \u201cOur next generation is growing up in this environment. They have no aim and no future. I am very worried about where they will go and what they will do in the days to come.\u201d",
      "Hasina, 78, was convicted Monday on five charges of crimes against humanity. She also was sentenced to prison until natural death for making inflammatory remarks and ordering the extermination of student protesters with helicopters, drones and lethal weapons.",
      "A former police chief was sentenced to five years' imprisonment after pleading guilty and becoming a state witness against Hasina.",
      "Bangladesh experienced weeks of student-led protests in July and August last year. Demonstrators voiced discontent over a quota system for allocating government jobs that critics said favored those with connections to Hasina\u2019s party. More than 800 people were killed and about 14,000 were injured, Bangladesh\u2019s interim government reported. The United Nations in February estimated that as many as 1,400 people were killed.",
      "The uprising led to the collapse of Hasina\u2019s 15-year rule on Aug. 5, 2024. Hasina and Khan fled to India, which has declined to extradite them, making it unlikely they would ever be executed or imprisoned.",
      "Hasina cannot appeal unless she surrenders or is arrested within 30 days of the sentencing. She and Khan did not designate defense lawyers and rejected a state-appointed defense attorney for the tribunal.",

      "\u201cWe lost control of the situation, but to characterize what happened as a premeditated assault on citizens is simply to misread the facts,\u201d she said in a statement.",

      "New York-based Human Rights Watch expressed misgivings, saying the trial process raised \u201cserious human rights concerns\" and questioned statements by the witnesses and the conduct of the defense appointed by the state.",
      "\u201cThere is enduring anger and anguish in Bangladesh over Hasina\u2019s repressive rule, but all criminal proceedings need to meet international fair trial standards,\u201d said Meenakshi Ganguly, Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director.",
      "Those responsible for the \u201chorrific abuses\u201d under the Hasina administration should be held to account after \u201cimpartial investigations and credible trials,\" Ganguly said.",
      "Amnesty International Secretary General Agn\u00e8s Callamard protested the death sentence and said \u201cthis trial and sentence is neither fair nor just.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was not a fair trial,\" Callamard said in a statement Monday. \"The victims of July 2024 deserve far better. Bangladesh needs a justice process that is scrupulously fair and fully impartial beyond all suspicion of bias and does not resort to order further human rights violations through the death penalty.\"",
      "The sentencing came as Bangladesh grapples with stability under an interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, who took over an interim government three days after Hasina was ousted. An election is planned for February, although specific dates have not been announced.",

      "New Zealand's police agency faces a trust crisis and greater scrutiny of its powers after a sexual misconduct scandal involving former Deputy Police Commissioner Jevon McSkimming",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- He was one of the most powerful police officers in New Zealand and a year ago almost won the country\u2019s top law enforcement job. But the public didn\u2019t know Deputy Police Commissioner Jevon McSkimming was facing claims of sexual abuse during an affair with a young staffer and would soon be charged with viewing illegal sex images, including of child abuse, on his work computer.",
      "The case has provoked public outrage and reignited a debate about police power two decades after a national outcry about how the force handled another young woman\u2019s sexual violence accusations against officers. Since then, New Zealand's force has sought to reshape itself as a liberal and friendly law enforcement agency.",
      "\u201cThis is a big hit to integrity and trust for the police,\u201d Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told 1News on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be built back.\u201d",
      "Police bosses admit that won't be simple. A scathing watchdog report this month lambasted senior officers for minimizing the claims about McSkimming as he sought to become Police Commissioner. They instead pursued his accuser for online harassment.",
      "The saga emerged in August when McSkimming was revealed to be facing charges of possessing child sexual abuse material and other illegal sexual content. He admitted some of the charges earlier in November.",
      "Court documents said he viewed thousands of sexual images on work devices during office hours, including numerous illegal images. He will be sentenced in December and faces up to 10 years in prison.",
      "During a period of four and half years, about a third of all McSkimming's internet searches during work hours were for sexual content, the documents said. At the time, he was the force's Chief Security Officer.",
      "The images were discovered as investigators probed separate complaints made by a woman with whom McSkimming had an affair when she was a police employee. The woman, 21 when she met the then-40-year-old McSkimming, accused him of sexual abuse in messages to police bosses, politicians and news outlets.",
      "McSkimming's peers believed his denials without question, according to a report this month by the Independent Police Conduct Authority.",
      "The watchdog said police bosses tried to rush an investigation into the complaints because they feared it would prevent McSkimming from winning the top job, but the inquiry gained momentum when lower ranking officers challenged their bosses.",
      "No charges were laid against McSkimming over the woman's claims, but investigators charged McSkimming's accuser with online harassment of him and other officers.",
      "The charge of harassing McSkimming was dropped this month, but the woman remains before the courts on other counts.",
      "\u201cThe way her complaints were handled should alarm all New Zealanders,\u201d the woman\u2019s lawyer Steven Lack said Tuesday. \u201cIt suggests that the police were more focused on protecting Mr. McSkimming\u2019s career and advancement than on properly assessing serious allegations of offending against him.\u201d",
      "The case prompted fury in New Zealand, in part because it evoked previous episodes of police sexual misconduct and cover-up.",
      "\u201cIt was like deja vu,\u201d survivor advocate Louise Nicholas said on Tuesday. \u201cI was so saddened to see and hear, God, we\u2019re going through this again.\u201d",
      "Nicholas became a household name two decades ago over her efforts to see police officers convicted of raping her, which she said began when she was 13. The Associated Press does not usually identify people who say they were subjected to sexual abuse, but Nicholas said she preferred to have her name used.",

      "The transport by the Armed Forces of the Philippines of supplies and a fresh batch of navy personnel to the Second Thomas Shoal was successfully \u201cconducted without any untoward incident\u201d Friday despite the presence of Chinese Coast Guard and other ships which have been guarding the periphery of the Philippines-occupied shoal for years, the officials told The Associated Press.",
      "They did not elaborate and spoke on condition of anonymity because of the issue\u2019s sensitivity.",

      "The Philippine military has carried out 12 such deliveries of supplies and new personnel without incident to the long-grounded Sierra Madre since last year.

      "LIGARI, Nigeria -- The villagers in northwestern Nigeria were settling in for church service when motorcycle-riding gunmen invaded, shooting at random and seizing at least 62 people, including the pastor and several children.",
      "They were marched into the nearby bush, then forced to walk for two days to a forest hideout. There, they said, they were held for nearly a month while relatives and other villagers sold anything they could \u2014 farmland, livestock, motorcycles \u2014 to raise the ransom demanded for their release.",
      "They got little food and sleep, were told to renounce Christianity, and saw two fellow hostages killed, four of the villagers who were eventually freed told The Associated Press in interviews at their church in the Ligari community, in Nigeria\u2019s Kaduna state.",
      "\u201cI told my people even if they see my dead body, they should not deny Jesus and they should remain strong,\u201d said the Rev. Micah Bulus, resident pastor of Kauna Baptist Church.",
      "Since the attack last November, the community has experienced more violence, like much of the conflict-battered north. On Monday, gunmen abducted 25 schoolgirls and killed at least one staff member at a boarding school in Kebbi, another northwestern state.",
      "In Ligari, villagers say nearly every household has seen a relative, friend or neighbor killed or abducted. It's part of the longstanding security crisis in Nigeria \u2014 a place now singled out by U.S. President Donald Trump for \u201cthe killing of Christians\u201d by \u201cradical Islamists.\u201d",
      "Victims and church leaders echo Trump's claims that Christians are persecuted. They say they\u2019ve long been attacked, kidnapped or killed because of their faith.",
      "But many insist the reality isn't as simple as Trump's narrative, which casts Christianity as facing an \u201cexistential threat\u201d in Nigeria. Experts and residents say some attacks target Christians, but most emphasize that in the widespread violence that has long plagued the West African nation, everyone is a potential victim, regardless of background or belief.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t ask you whether you are a Muslim or a Christian,\u201d 32-year-old Abdulmalik Saidu said of the gunmen regularly stalking his northwestern state, Zamfara. \"All they want is just money from you. (Even) if you have money, sometimes they will kill you.\u201d",
      "Saidu, a Muslim, said his brother was shot dead during a kidnapping operation along a major highway, and the family never recovered his body, for fear of attacks. In Kaduna, an imam told AP that he's lost a grandson, cousin and brother, and his family has been displaced twice due to violence. Other religious leaders say mosques have been destroyed, people have fled, and desperate Muslims \u2014 like their Christian neighbors \u2014 have been forced to sell goods and belongings for ransom.",
      "\"The kind of pain we\u2019ve gone through for the past years \u2014 this issue affects both faiths,\u201d said the imam, Idris Ishaq.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s population of 220 million is split almost evenly between Christians, who live predominantly in the south, and Muslims, mostly in the north \u2014 where attacks have long been concentrated and where levels of illiteracy, poverty and hunger are among the country\u2019s highest. Nationwide, Muslims constitute a slight majority.",
      "Experts and data from two nonpartisan sources \u2014 the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project and Council on Foreign Relations \u2014 show Christians are often targets in a small percentage of overall attacks that appear to be motivated by religion, in some northern states.",
      "But the numbers and analysts also indicate that across the north, most victims of overall violence are Muslims.",
      "Analysts and residents blame the killings on rampant corruption that limits weapons supplies to security forces, the failure to prosecute attackers, and porous borders that ensure steady weapons supplies to gangs.",
      "\u201cThese attacks are indiscriminate: They attack state institutions, they target Nigerians in their places of worship, they target Nigerians in civilian locations,\u201d said Bulama Bukarti, a Nigerian conflict researcher and human rights lawyer. \u201cIn essence, it is a war against Nigeria.\u201d",

      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- Chileans face perhaps the starkest choice in the history of their country\u2019s young democracy when they vote next month in a presidential runoff that pits hard-right Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast against communist Jeannette Jara.",
      "Neither candidate cleared the 50% threshold to win, but Kast heads into the second round of voting best positioned to succeed after an unprecedented 70% of voters backed an array of right-wing parties in Sunday\u2019s poll.",

      "That choice is perhaps most personal, and fraught, for Chile\u2019s 1.5 million immigrants \u2014 in particular, the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who escaped the repressive socialist government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to make this narrow sliver of a country their home.",

      "\u201cCommunism destroyed my country, and the last thing I want is for my other home to fall into that same system,\u201d said Edwin Bejar, 61, who fled political persecution in Venezuela for Chile seven years ago and plans to vote again for Kast next month.",

Monday was dominated by speeches, with several leaders from Global South nations giving emotional testimony on devastating costs of recent extreme weather and natural disasters.",
      "Vulnerable nations have pressed for more ambition at these talks as world leaders have begun to acknowledge that Earth will almost surely go past a hoped-for limit \u2014 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) in Earth's warming since pre-industrial times. That was the target set at these talks in 2015 in the landmark Paris agreement.",
      "Scientists say in addition to deadly heat, a warming atmosphere leads to more frequent and deadly extreme weather such as flooding, droughts, violent downpours and more powerful hurricanes.",
      "Leo said there's still time to stay within the Paris Agreement, but not much.",
      "\u201cAs stewards of God\u2019s creation, we are called to act swiftly, with faith and prophecy, to protect the gift He entrusted to us,\u201d he said.

      "Hungary is gearing up for a heated political battle as Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n faces an unprecedented challenge from his opponent, P\u00e9ter Magyar",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- With Hungary's parliamentary elections still five months away, the country is already immersed in an intense political campaign between Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his challenger, P\u00e9ter Magyar, that promises to be the biggest challenge of the nationalist leader's career.",
      "Elected for a first term in 1998 and then for four more terms beginning in 2010, Orb\u00e1n has stood at Hungary's helm for 20 years. Beloved by his supporters but accused by his critics of corruption and authoritarian tactics, he has overseen a political system in which his far-right Fidesz party has exercised nearly unchecked power.",
      "But now, support for Europe's longest-serving leader is declining amid poor economic performance and chronic inflation, and a challenger who has shifted the political tides by promising to dismantle Orb\u00e1n's system and put Hungary on a more prosperous, democratic track.",
      "\u201cViktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s despicable, corrupt government will do everything to preserve their stolen loot and their power, we have no doubt,\u201d Magyar, a 44-year-old former Fidesz insider, told The Associated Press. \u201cThis power cannot be reformed, it is not able to regain contact with the people. This power has become inhumane.\u201d",
      "Most polls show Magyar and his Tisza party with a solid lead over Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz \u2014 a feat nearly unprecedented for any opposition force in the past two decades.",
      "Many observers in Hungary have puzzled over how Magyar, unlike generations of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s previous political opponents, has in fewer than two years managed to emerge from relative obscurity to build a party with such substantial support.",
      "Andr\u00e1s B\u00edr\u00f3-Nagy, director of the Budapest-based Policy Solutions think tank, says Magyar\u2019s near-constant \u201cgrassroots campaigning\u201d in rural Hungary \u2014 and his focus on bread-and-butter issues like the cost of living and poor public services \u2014 have contributed to his success in small towns that traditionally gravitated toward Orb\u00e1n\u2019s nationalist message.",
      "On Thursday, Magyar visited Tab, a community of fewer than 4,000 people in southwestern Hungary. The stop was one of dozens he plans across the country on a tour he calls \u201cRoad to Victory.\u201d",
      "Hundreds filled the town\u2019s socialist-era community center and listened to Magyar speak for nearly two hours. As Erika Bogn\u00e1r, a 76-year-old widowed retiree, walked into the event, she declared angrily that her monthly pension was too low to survive on, and that she wanted \u201ca system change, because this system sucks.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverywhere in the shops people are grumbling they can\u2019t make ends meet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe live in misery, we have been pushed completely into misery.\u201d",
      "Bogn\u00e1r\u2019s experience reflects that of many Hungarians who are dissatisfied with the country's economy. The European Union has frozen some 14 billion euros ($16.2 billion) in funding to Hungary over rule-of-law and corruption concerns, a deficit that has exacerbated chronically stagnant economic performance.",
      "Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has sought to mitigate the economic pain by introducing price caps on many products, and to woo voters with pre-election government spending like low-interest loans for first-time home buyers and abolishing income tax for mothers with at least two children.",
      "Still, Bogn\u00e1r, who says she\u2019s rarely voted in elections until now, blames Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government for rising costs of living, and believes that if Magyar is elected, \u201cit won\u2019t get any worse.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n has sought to portray his opponent as an existential danger that \u2014 through his inexperience and alleged foreign allegiances \u2014 would bankrupt the country and drag it into the war in neighboring Ukraine, allegations Magyar has denied.",
      "Unlike nearly every other EU leader, Orb\u00e1n has refused to supply Ukraine with economic aid or weapons to assist in its defense against Russia's full-scale invasion, and has cast as warmongers those countries that do support Kyiv.",
      "He has also cast the EU as an oppressive force, and compared the bloc to the Soviet Union, which dominated and occupied Hungary for decades in the 20th century.",

      "The Tisza party, Orb\u00e1n has alleged, is nothing more than an EU project contrived in Brussels to topple his government and install a puppet regime that will drain Hungary's finances into Ukraine \u2014 and even involve it directly in the war.",
      "\u201cWhoever thinks that they support a change in government is in reality supporting the war, whether they know it or not,\" Orb\u00e1n said in a speech to tens of thousands of supporters in October.",
      "\u201cThere are many Hungarians who believe that they are supporting a good cause when they support Brussels and its puppet government candidates. We must tell them: Brussels today is not a source of help, but a source of danger.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n's message is amplified by a sprawling pro-government media empire that has dominated Hungary's political discourse for more than a decade, as well as taxpayer-funded campaigns that malign Magyar and promote Orb\u00e1n's policies.",
      "Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n, who is not related to the prime minister but is his political director and Fidesz's campaign manager, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "B\u00edr\u00f3-Nagy noted that the past several Hungarian elections were deemed \u201cfree but not fair\u201d by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which found a \u201cpervasive overlap\" between the messaging of Fidesz and the government, as well as biased news coverage that \u201climited voters\u2019 opportunity to make an informed choice.\u201d",
      "The situation for the 2026 elections \"has not changed in any sense,\u201d B\u00edr\u00f3-Nagy said. \u201cWhat we see is that there is no level playing field.\u201d",
      "S\u00e1ndor Rofrics, a member of a local Tisza activist group in Tab, said outside Magyar\u2019s event that he believes \u201cmoney is no object for Fidesz, even state money. They will spend a lot of public money on this campaign.\u201d",
      "Magyar himself acknowledges that his party has fewer resources with which to campaign, portraying the contest as a \u201cDavid and Goliath\u201d struggle where \u201cwe\u2019re essentially facing a machine with a full arsenal \u2014 propaganda, secret services, unlimited government money.\u201d",
      "In addition to traditionally opposition liberal and centrist voters, Tisza has also reached out to disaffected Fidesz supporters and voters with more conservative views. Magyar says his party does not define itself \u201calong ideological fault lines,\" but campaigns on \"the image of a functioning and humane Hungary, bringing EU money home, introducing anti-corruption measures and welcoming everyone in our community.\u201d",
      "With five months until the ballot and Tisza still leading, Magyar said he senses a desire for change in the towns and villages he visits on his campaign tour. But despite his party's lead, \u201cI think you should never look down on or underestimate your opponent, especially not Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\"",
      "\u201cHe is an experienced player and has a lot to lose in this election, perhaps more than just the prime minister\u2019s seat,\" he said.",

      "More alarming, much of the lending was to help Chinese companies buy stakes in U.S. businesses, many tied to critical technology and national security, including a robotics maker, a semiconductor company and a biotech firm.",
      "The report found a far more widespread and sophisticated lending network than previously thought \u2014 a web of financial obligations extending beyond developing countries to rich ones, including the U.K., Germany, Australia, the Netherlands and other U.S. allies.",
      "\u201cChina was playing chess while the rest of us were playing checkers,\u201d said former White House investment adviser William Henagan, who worries the hidden lending has given China a chokehold on technologies. \u201cWars will be won or lost based on whether you can control products critical to running an economy.\"",
      "While the U.S. still welcomes most foreign investment \u2014 and President Donald Trump has courted it \u2014 money from China has drawn particular scrutiny as the world's two biggest economies with opposing ideologies battle for global supremacy.",
      "Deals financed by China\u2019s state-owned banks, the ones studied in the AidData report, are especially problematic. The lenders are controlled by China's central government and the Communist Party's Central Financial Commission, and they are directed to advance China\u2019s strategic goals.",
      "In total, the AidData report found China lent more than $2 trillion from 2000 through 2023 around the world, double the highest previous estimates and a surprise to even longtime analysts of China's rise. And much of the lending to wealthy countries was focused on critical minerals and high-tech assets \u2014 rare earths and semiconductors needed for fighter jets, submarines, radar systems, precision-guided missiles and telecom networks.",
      "\u201cThe U.S., under both (former President Joe) Biden and Trump, have been beating this drum for more than a decade that Beijing is a predatory lender,\u201d said Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. \u201cThe irony is very rich.\u201d",
      "Until now, a full accounting of China's state lending has never been published because much of the financing is buried beneath layers of secrecy, masked by Western-sounding shell companies and mislabeled by international databases as ordinary private financing.",
      "\u201cThere is a complete lack of transparency that speaks to the lengths to which China goes, whether through shell companies or confidentiality agreements or redactions, to make it extremely difficult to come up with this full picture,\u201d said Scott Nathan, the former head of the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., an agency set up in the first Trump term to invest in foreign projects deemed in the U.S. national interest.",
      "Since the report\u2019s last documented loan in 2023, U.S. scrutiny has gotten better. Screening mechanisms, such as the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., got beefed up in 2020 to protect sensitive sectors in the economy.",
      "But China has gotten better, too, in part by setting up banks and branches overseas \u2014 more than 100 in recent years \u2014 that then lend to offshore entities, further clouding the origins of the money.",
      "\u201cIn places where there are more cops on the beat,\" Parks said, \u201cit has found ways to work around barriers to entry.\u201d",

      "Chinese state bank financing has touched projects across the U.S., particularly in the Northeast, the Great Lakes region, the West Coast and along the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has renamed the Gulf of America. Many loans targeted critical high-tech industries, according to the report.",
      "\u2014 In 2015, for instance, Chinese state-owned banks lent $1.2 billion to a private Chinese business to buy an 80% stake in Ironshore, a U.S. insurer whose clients included the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation officials and undercover agents who might need help paying legal bills in case they got into trouble in their jobs.",
      "U.S. regulators were unaware of the Chinese government involvement because the financing was funneled through a Cayman Island business with no obvious ties to China, according to the report. U.S. officials later realized the Chinese government could access information and ordered the Chinese buyer to divest.",
      "\u2014 That same year, the Chinese government published \u201cMade in China 2025,\" a list of 10 high-tech areas, such as semiconductors, biotechnology and robotics, where it wanted to reach 70% self-sufficiency within a decade. The next year, in 2016, the Export\u2013Import Bank of China, a policy bank, provided $150 million in loans to help a Chinese company buy a robotics equipment company in Michigan.",
      "After China\u2019s adoption of the manufacturing master plan, the percentage of projects targeting sensitive sectors such as robotics, defense, quantum computing and biotechnology rose from 46% to 88% of China\u2019s portfolio for cross-border acquisition lending, according to AidData.",
      "\u2014 In 2017, a Delaware private equity firm using a Cayman Islands company tried to buy a U.S. chip maker; the deal was blocked when investigators discovered both companies were owned by a Chinese state-owned enterprise. That same Delaware company successfully bought a U.K. semiconductor maker that had to be divested when British authorities found out.",
      "\u2014 And in 2022, the U.K. forced a Chinese company to divest another sensitive British firm in the industry, a designer of chips in Apple phones but potentially adaptable for military systems. The Chinese company had bought it through a company in the Netherlands that they owned. That Dutch firm is now accused of withholding semiconductors vital to automakers in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "To trace China's hidden lending, AidData dug through regulatory filings, private contracts and stock exchange disclosures in more than 200 countries written in multiple languages.",
      "The effort to track China's state loans and investment started more than a decade ago when Beijing launched its Belt & Road Initiative to build infrastructure in developing countries. The project expanded sharply three years ago when the AidData team, which eventually grew to 140 researchers, realized many of the loans were landing in advanced economies such as the U.S., Australia, the Netherlands and Portugal, where acquisitions could allow it to access technology that Beijing considers essential to its global rise.",
      "The report says the findings show a shift in the use of state credit from promoting economic development and social welfare to gaining geo-economic advantages.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s global concern that this is part of a concerted effort to gain control over economic chokepoints and use this leverage,\u201d said Brad Setser, an adviser to the U.S. Trade Representative in the Biden administration. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we understand what they\u2019re doing, and they don\u2019t make it easy.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- More people are falling behind on paying their bills to keep on the lights and heat their homes, according to a new analysis of consumer data \u2014 a warning sign for the U.S. economy and another political headache for President Donald Trump.",
      "Past due balances to utility companies jumped 9.7% annually to $789 between the April-June periods of 2024 and 2025, said The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank. The increase has overlapped with a 12% jump in monthly energy bills during the same period.",
      "Consumers usually prioritize their utility bills along with their mortgages and auto debt, said Julie Margetta Morgan, the foundation's president. The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of information out there about rising utility costs, but here we can actually look at what that impact has been on families in terms of how they\u2019re falling behind,\" Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Troubles paying electricity and natural gas bills reflect something of an economic quandary for Trump, who is promoting the buildout of the artificial intelligence industry as a key part of an economic boom he has promised for America. But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity, and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.",
      "These troubles also come as Trump faces political pressure from voters fed up with the high cost of living.",
      "Ever since Republicans saw their fortunes sag in off-year elections this month and affordability was identified as the top issue, Trump has been trying to convince the public that prices are falling. Fast-rising electricity bills could be an issue in some congressional battlegrounds in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Trump has put a particular emphasis on prices at the pump. Gasoline accounts for about 3% of the consumer price index, slightly less than the share belonging to electricity and natural gas bills \u2014 meaning that possible savings on gasoline could be more than offset by higher utility bills.",
      "The president maintains that any troubling data on inflation is false and that Democrats are simply trying to hurt his administration's reputation.",

The airline currently flies 95 Boeing 737 variants, with Airbus wanting to break into the carrier's fleet. FlyDubai ordered $11 billion worth of 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners at the last air show, which when delivered will be the airline's first wide-body aircraft.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. stock market sank Monday as Nvidia and other superstars created by the frenzy around artificial-intelligence  technology dimmed some more.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 0.9% and pulled further from its all-time high  set late last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 557 points, or 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.8%.",
      "Nvidia was the heaviest weight on the market, as it\u2019s often been in its last couple of tumultuous weeks. The chip company fell 1.8%, while losses for other AI winners included a 6.4% slide for Super Micro Computer.",
      "Other areas of the market that had been high-momentum winners also sank. Bitcoin fell below $92,000, down from nearly $125,000 last month, for example. That helped drag down Coinbase Global by 7.1% and Robinhood Markets by 5.3%.",
      "Critics have been warning  that the U.S. stock market could be primed for a drop  because of how high prices have shot since April, leaving them looking too expensive. Critics point in particular to stocks swept up in the AI mania, which have been surging at spectacular speeds for years.",
      "Even with Monday\u2019s loss, Nvidia is still up 39% for the year so far after it doubled in price in four of the last five years.",
      "That has Wall Street\u2019s spotlight on Wednesday, when Nvidia will report how much profit it made during the summer. AI stocks have surged as much as they have because of expectations that they\u2019ll produce huge growth in profits. If they fail to top analysts\u2019 expectations, that would undercut one of the big assumptions that\u2019s driven the U.S. stock market to records.",
      "Such high expectations extend beyond tech stocks, even if they are toughest for AI darlings.",
      "Aramark fell 5.2% after the company reported a profit for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations. The company, which offers food and facilities management for schools, national parks and convention centers, also said it expects an underlying measure of profit to grow between 20% and 25% this upcoming year. While relatively strong, that was less than what analysts had been forecasting.",
      "That helped offset a rise of 3.1% for Alphabet. It jumped after Berkshire Hathaway said it built a $4.34 billion ownership stake in Google\u2019s parent company. Berkshire Hathaway, run by famed investor Warren Buffett, is notorious for trying to buy stocks only when they look like good values while avoiding anything that looks too expensive.",
      "All told, the S&P 500 fell 61.70 points to 6,672.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 557.24 to 46,590.24, and the Nasdaq composite sank 192.51 to 22,708.07.",
      "Another source of potential disappointment for Wall Street is what the Federal Reserve  does with interest rates. The expectation had been that the Fed would keep cutting interest rates in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market. Wall Street loves lower rates because they can give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments.",

The downside of lower interest rates is that they can make inflation worse, and inflation has stubbornly remained  above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",

With less information and less certainty about how things are going, some Fed officials have suggested it may be better to wait in December to get more clarity.",
      "Now that the shutdown is over, the government is preparing to release September\u2019s delayed jobs report on Thursday. That could create further swings for the market. Data that\u2019s very strong would likely stay the Fed\u2019s hand on rate cuts, while figures that are very weak would raise worries about the economy.",
      "In 2026, the Fed is likely to cut interest rates only in response to a slowing economy instead of trying to cut ahead of it, according to Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel. That\u2019s not as good an environment for stock prices, and Bannister said the \u201cFed\u2019s \u2018free lunch\u2019 is over.\u201d",

      "Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has joined the advisory board of Ukraine\u2019s leading defense company, renowned for its long-range drones capable of striking targets deep inside Russia, as a corruption investigation continues.",
      "In an effort to enhance its international reputation, Fire Point is establishing a new factory in Denmark and bringing prominent industry figures on board. It also aims to expand its operations to produce battle-tested cruise missiles, with plans to more than double its current capacity.",
      "However, public scrutiny remains intense during an ongoing corruption investigation. Fire Point\u2019s executives insist they have nothing to hide and are operating under strict martial law protocols, even commissioning an independent audit to appease investigators. Critics, however, question the company\u2019s opaque origins and the monopoly of its contracts with the Defense Ministry, and point to alleged links to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s notorious associate Tymur Mindich, who is implicated in a major corruption scandal.",
      "\u201cIn general it\u2019s good they are working on this,\u201d said Iryna Terekh, Fire Point\u2019s chief technology officer of the investigation. \u201cWe completely support, as a company, the fact that this investigation is happening.\u201d",
      "Terekh said Fire Point has commissioned a major international firm to conduct an independent audit of its pricing and production to quell concerns. The investigation by anti-corruption organizations, launched a year ago, is still ongoing, she said. \u201cWe will be waiting for the results to come.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press was given exclusive access to a factory in Ukraine where its cruise missile, known as the Flamingo or FP-5, is assembled. The AP was given access on the condition the exact location is not named, due the risk of Russian attacks.",
      "Fire Point, which rose to prominence after initially being relatively unknown following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, now reports around $1 billion in revenue this year. It is also constructing a factory in Denmark to manufacture essential rocket propellent.",
      "In the meantime, the company is forging ahead with plans to expand.",
      "The company launched an advisory board and named Pompeo as a member on Nov. 12, executives told AP. \u201cIt\u2019s a big honor for us,\u201d Terekh said, speaking from the factory floor. \u201cWe decided that since we are growing into a big international company, we have to ensure we are following the clearest and best corporate standards.\u201d",
      "Another three individuals will join the board. \u201cWe are rising as a company and we want a wise adviser board to help us establish this work,\u201d said Terekh.",
      "U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg also visited one of Fire Point\u2019s factories during his last visit, executives said, in a visit that included other Ukrainian defense technology companies as well.",
      "Building on the success of its deep-strike drone, the FP-1, which AP was granted exclusive access to view in August, the company is now planning to ramp up production of its cruise missiles. They are also in high demand among Ukrainian forces as Western missiles remain hard to access in sufficient quantities to debilitate Russian capabilities.",
      "Fire Point has successfully tested Flamingo on the battlefield at least four times, company executives said. In late August it was used to strike an FSB base in Armiansk in the occupied Crimean Peninsula. This week, the missile was used to strike targets in the Russian city of Oryol. The company did not provide its current production capacity, citing security concerns.",
      "Production is going according to plans, company executives said, without elaborating on precise figures for security concerns.",
      "On the factory floor, dozens of hollowed hulls of missile frames lay scattered. These are made with carbon fiber, a material better suited to eluding Russian radars than aluminum, Maksym, the head of design told the AP. He spoke on condition that only his first name be used for security reasons.",
      "Fire Point is a significant beneficiary of the so-called Danish model, a financing mechanism spearheaded by Denmark, in which foreign governments directly fund Ukrainian defense companies, rather than procuring weapons from their own industries to send as aid. A factory to produce solid rocket fuel for missiles, including the Flamingo, is being established in Denmark.",

      "Lawmakers raised an issue with Fire Point because of its apparent monopoly over deep strike drones, its ability to garner lucrative contracts despite being relatively unknown, and obscurity over its ownership. Its legally listed owner is Yehor Skalyha, who maintains connections to the entertainment industry, just like Mindich.",

    "story": [
      "By the end of next year, the state of Para is requiring all cattle to be tagged to trace where they came from in order to be sold legally",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Maria Gorete, who just began ranching three years ago, is doing something new with her 76 head of cattle in the Brazilian countryside near the town of Novo Repartimento.",
      "She's piercing their ears.",
      "Their new jewelry \u2014 ear tags, actually \u2014 will track their movements throughout their lives as part of an initiative aimed at slowing deforestation in the Brazilian state of Para. Depending on how well it works, it's the kind of solution the world needs more of to slow climate change, the subject of annual United Nations talks just a few hours away in Belem.",
      "With about 20 million cattle in Para, it's a mammoth task. Some of them are on big farms closer to cities, but others are in remote areas where farmers have been cutting down Amazon rainforest to make room for their pastures. That\u2019s a problem for climate change because it means trees that absorb pollution are being replaced by cattle that emit methane, a powerful planet-warming gas.",
      "Brazil has lost about 339,685 square kilometers (131,153 square miles) of mature rainforest since 2001 \u2014 an area roughly the size of Germany \u2014 and more than a third of that loss was in Para, according to Global Forest Watch. Para alone accounts for about 14% of all rainforest loss recorded worldwide over the last 24 years.",
      "Gorete, with her small herd, said the tagging hasn't been much of a hassle. And she sees the program as a good thing. It will let her sell her beef to companies and countries whose consumers want to know where it came from.",
      "\u201cWith this identification, it opens doors to the world,\u201d said Gorete, who before cattle ranching cultivated acai and cacao. \u201cIt adds value to the animals.\u201d",
      "Cows can move to several farms in their lifetime \u2014 born on one pasture, sold to a different farmer, or two or three or more, until they\u2019ve grown to their full weight and are sold to a processor, said Marina Piatto, executive director of the Brazilian agriculture and conservation NGO Imaflora.",
      "Tracking those movements effectively can be a way to discourage deforestation. That's where the tagging comes in.",
      "Starting next year, all cattle being transported in Para have to be tagged. Each animal actually gets a tag in each ear. One is a written number that is registered with the government in an official database. The other is an electronic chip that links to the same information as the number registered to the cow \u2014 like when and where it was born, where it was raised, the owner, the breed and more. By 2027, all cattle in Para, including cattle born on ranches in the state, have to have tags.",
      "Once a tag is removed, it\u2019s broken and can\u2019t be put back, a measure to help avoid fraud.",
      "When the cattle moves, owners are required to report those movements and buyers are required to log the transaction. To be able to sell their animals, ranchers must have tags and a clean history. Locations registered with the government where the animals have been can be checked against satellite images to detect illegal deforestation, or against maps that show Indigenous territories that are supposed to be off-limits for cattle.",
      "\u201cThe only solution is individual cattle traceability because then you can know for each movement where that cattle has been and if it has been in a place that has been deforested in the past,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Otavio Passos, the Brazilian Amazon director with The Nature Conservancy.",
      "Mauro Lucio, 60, has 2,600 cattle on his farm in Paragominas about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of Belem. He said the new tagging program was an easy transition for him because he's been tagging his cattle since 2000. He did it to track his own herd, but he sees the benefit of the government now being involved.",
      "\u201cFor me, this is the same tool,\" he said.",

      "The committee that has been coordinating between government, industry and producers has been working on ways to prevent fraud and use law enforcement most effectively, said Fernando Sampaio, sustainability director of the Brazilian Association of Meat Exporting Industries. For that, they have to know where to look; for instance, if a farm is selling more animals than its size would suggest, that might be a red flag.",

It's unclear what impact the advisory will have on the willingness of Chinese to visit Japan, but several Chinese airlines offered no-penalty refunds on previously sold tickets to Japan following the government's announcement.",

      "The interruption of federal economic statistics came at an awkward time. President Donald Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 sweeping, ever-changing import taxes and massive deportations of people working in the United States illegally \u2014 are creating uncertainty about the economic outlook.",
      "And the economy has sent conflicting signals: Economic growth looked solid at midyear and unemployment has been low. But job growth has lost momentum, and inflation has remained stubbornly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, partly because of the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Jefferies' Simons expects the September employment report to show that employers added 65,000 jobs that month \u2014 unimpressive, but up from a meager 22,000 in August. He figures that unemployment remained at a low 4.3%.",
      "The data cutoff has caused consternation on Wall Street and deepened divisions among Fed officials over whether to cut interest rates for a third straight time at their next meeting in December.",

      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics will likely have enough data from businesses to calculate how many jobs were gained or lost last month. Much of that is submitted electronically.

      "For technology adopters looking for the next big thing, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is the future. At least, that's what the marketing pitches and tech industry T-shirts say.",
      "What makes an artificial intelligence product \u201cagentic\u201d depends on who's selling it. But the promise is usually that it's a step beyond today's generative AI chatbots.",
      "Chatbots, however useful, are all talk and no action. They can answer questions, retrieve and summarize information, write papers and generate images, music, video and lines of code. AI agents, by contrast, are supposed to be able to take actions on a person's behalf.",
      "But if you're confused, you're not alone. Google searches for \u201cagentic\u201d have skyrocketed from near obscurity a year ago to a peak earlier this fall.",
      "A new report Tuesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston Consulting Group, who surveyed more than 2,000 business executives around the world, describes agentic AI as a \u201cnew class of systems\u201d that \u201ccan plan, act, and learn on their own.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not just tools to be operated or assistants waiting for instructions,\u201d says the MIT Sloan Management Review report. \"Increasingly, they behave like autonomous teammates, capable of executing multistep processes and adapting as they go.\u201d",
      "AI chatbots \u2014 such as the original ChatGPT that debuted three years ago this month \u2014 rely on systems called large language models that predict the next word in a sentence based on the huge trove of human writings they've been trained on. They can sound remarkably human, especially when given a voice, but are effectively performing a kind of word completion.",
      "That's different from what AI developers \u2014 including ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI, and tech giants like Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Salesforce \u2014 have in mind for AI agents.",
      "\u201cA generative AI-based chatbot will say, \u2018Here are the great ideas\u2019 \u2026 and then be done,\u201d said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at Amazon Web Services, in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s useful, but what makes things agentic is that it goes beyond what a chatbot does.\u201d",
      "Sivasubramanian, a longtime Amazon employee, took on his new role helping to lead work on AI agents in Amazon's cloud computing division earlier this year. He sees great promise in AI systems that can be given a \u201chigh-level goal\u201d and break it down into a series of steps and act upon them. \u201cI truly believe agentic AI is going to be one of the biggest transformations since the beginning of the cloud,\u201d he said.",
      "For most consumers, the first encounters with AI agents could be in realms like online shopping. Set a budget and some preferences and AI agents can buy things or arrange travel bookings using your credit card. In the longer run, the hope is that they can do more complex tasks with access to your computer and a set of guidelines to follow.",

      "Dietterich has some quibbles with certain companies using \u201cagentic\u201d to describe \u201cany action a computer might do, including just looking things up on the web,\u201d but he has no doubt that the technology has immense possibilities as AI systems are given the \u201cfreedom and responsibility\u201d to refine goals and respond to changing conditions as they work on people's behalf.",
      "\u201cWe can imagine a world in which there are thousands or millions of agents operating and they can form coalitions,\u201d Dietterich said. \u201cCan they form cartels? Would there be law enforcement (AI) agents?",
      "Milind Tambe has been researching AI agents that work together for three decades, since the first International Conference on Multi-Agent Systems gathered in San Francisco in 1995. Tambe said he's been \u201camused\u201d by the sudden popularity of \u201cagentic\u201d as an adjective. Previously, the word describing something that has agency was mostly found in other academic fields, such as psychology or chemistry.",
      "But computer scientists have been debating what an agent is for as long as Tambe has been studying them.",
      "In the 1990s, \u201cpeople agreed that some software appeared more like an agent, and some felt less like an agent, and there was not a perfect dividing line,\u201d said Tambe, a professor at Harvard University. \u201cNonetheless, it seemed useful to use the word \u2018agent\u2019 to describe software or robotic entities acting autonomously in an environment, sensing the environment, reacting to it, planning, thinking.\u201d",
      "The prominent AI researcher Andrew Ng, co-founder of online learning company Coursera, helped advocate for popularizing the adjective \u201cagentic\u201d more than a year ago to encompass a broader spectrum of AI tasks. At the time, he also appreciated that mainly \u201ctechnical people\u201d were describing it that way.",
      "\u201cWhen I see an article that talks about \u2018agentic\u2019 workflows, I\u2019m more likely to read it, since it\u2019s less likely to be marketing fluff and more likely to have been written by someone who understands the technology,\u201d Ng wrote in a June 2024 blog post.",
      "Ng didn't respond to requests for comment on whether he still thinks that.",

      "Cities and states in the U.S. are turning to AI to improve road safety",
      "As America\u2019s aging roads fall further behind on much-needed repairs, cities and states are turning to artificial intelligence to spot the worst hazards and decide which fixes should come first.",
      "Hawaii officials, for example, are giving away 1,000 dashboard cameras as they try to reverse a recent spike in traffic fatalities. The cameras will use AI to automate inspections of guardrails, road signs and pavement markings, instantly discerning between minor problems and emergencies that warrant sending a maintenance crew.",
      "\u201cThis is not something where it\u2019s looked at once a month and then they sit down and figure out where they\u2019re going to put their vans,\u201d said Richard Browning, chief commercial officer at Nextbase, which developed the dashcams and imagery platform for Hawaii.",
      "After San Jose, California, started mounting cameras on street sweepers, city staff confirmed the system correctly identified potholes 97% of the time. Now they're expanding the effort to parking enforcement vehicles.",
      "Texas, where there are more roadway lane miles than the next two states combined, is less than a year into a massive AI plan that uses cameras as well as cellphone data from drivers who enroll to improve safety.",
      "Other states use the technology to inspect street signs or build annual reports about road congestion.",
      "Hawaii drivers over the next few weeks will be able to sign up for a free dashcam valued at $499 under the \u201cEyes on the Road\u201d campaign, which was piloted on service vehicles in 2021 before being paused due to wildfires.",
      "Roger Chen, a University of Hawaii associate professor of engineering who is helping facilitate the program, said the state faces unique challenges in maintaining its outdated roadway infrastructure.",
      "\u201cEquipment has to be shipped to the island,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a space constraint and a topography constraint they have to deal with, so it\u2019s not an easy problem.\u201d",
      "Although the program also monitors such things as street debris and faded paint on lane lines, the companies behind the technology particularly tout its ability to detect damaged guardrails.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re analyzing all guardrails in their state, every single day,\u201d said Mark Pittman, CEO of Blyncsy, which combines the dashboard feeds with mapping software to analyze road conditions.",
      "Hawaii transportation officials are well aware of the risks that can stem from broken guardrails. Last year, the state reached a $3.9 million settlement with the family of a driver who was killed in 2020 after slamming into a guardrail that had been damaged in a crash 18 months earlier but never repaired.",
      "In October, Hawaii recorded its 106th traffic fatality of 2025 \u2014 more than all of 2024. It's unclear how many of the deaths were related to road problems, but Chen said the grim trend underscores the timeliness of the dashboard program.",
      "San Jose has reported strong early success in identifying potholes and road debris just by mounting cameras on a few street sweepers and parking enforcement vehicles.",

      "Utilities are producing eye-popping forecasts about the amount of electricity they'll need to power massive new data centers that are feeding the fast-growing AI economy",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they'll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.",
      "But the challenges \u2014 some say the impossibility \u2014 of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.",
      "One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built \u2014 eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.",
      "The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that's ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.",
      "Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas \u2014 such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. \u2014 are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s speculation in there,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. \u201cNobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what\u2019s speculative, what\u2019s double-counting, what\u2019s real, what\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.",
      "Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.",
      "One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren't set in stone or lack the heft \u2014 clients, financing or otherwise \u2014 to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.",
      "Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.",
      "Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won't tell utilities if or where they've submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.",
      "The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation\u2019s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.",
      "\u201cBetter data, better decision-making, better and faster decisions mean we can get all these projects, all this infrastructure built,\u201d the commissioner, David Rosner, said in an interview.",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, said it welcomed efforts to improve demand forecasting.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents tech giants like Google and Meta and data center developers, has urged regulators to request more information from utilities on their forecasts and to develop a set of best practices to determine the commercial viability of a data center project.",
      "The coalition's vice president of energy, Aaron Tinjum, said improving the accuracy and transparency of forecasts is a \u201cfundamental first step of really meeting this moment\u201d of energy growth.",

      "States also are trying to do more to find out what\u2019s in utility forecasts and weed out speculative or duplicative projects.",
      "In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.",
      "They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.",
      "Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren\u2019t sure if the power requests \u201care real or just speculative or somewhere in between.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers passed legislation sponsored by King, now law, that requires data center developers to disclose whether they have requests for electricity elsewhere in Texas and to set standards for developers to show that they have a substantial financial commitment to a site.",
      "PPL Electric Utilities, which delivers power to 1.5 million customers across central and eastern Pennsylvania, projects that data centers will more than triple its peak electricity demand by 2030.",
      "Vincent Sorgi, president and CEO of PPL Corp., told analysts on an earnings call this month that the data center projects \u201care real, they are coming fast and furious\u201d and that the \u201cnear-term risk of overbuilding generation simply does not exist.\u201d",
      "The data center projects counted in the forecast are backed by contracts with financial commitments often reaching tens of millions of dollars, PPL said.",
      "Still, PPL's projections helped spur a state lawmaker, Rep. Danilo Burgos, to introduce a bill to bolster the authority of state utility regulators to inspect how utilities assemble their energy demand forecasts.",
      "Ratepayers in Burgos' Philadelphia district just absorbed an increase in their electricity bills \u2014 attributed by the utility, PECO, to the rising cost of wholesale electricity in the mid-Atlantic grid driven primarily by data center demand.",
      "That's why ratepayers need more protection to ensure they are benefiting from the higher cost, Burgos said.",
      "\u201cOnce they make their buck, whatever company,\u201d Burgos said, \u201cyou don\u2019t see no empathy towards the ratepayers.\u201d",

      "The 321-foot (98-meter) New Glenn blasted into the afternoon sky from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, sending NASA\u2019s twin Mars orbiters on a drawn-out journey to the red planet. Liftoff was stalled four days by lousy local weather as well as solar storms strong enough to paint the skies with auroras as far south as Florida.",
      "In a remarkable first, Blue Origin recovered the booster following its separation from the upper stage and the Mars orbiters, an essential step to recycle and slash costs similar to SpaceX. Company employees cheered wildly as the booster landed upright on a barge 375 miles (600 kilometers) offshore. An ecstatic Bezos watched the action from Launch Control.",
      "\u201cNext stop, moon!\u201d employees chanted following the booster's bull's-eye landing. Twenty minutes later, the rocket's upper stage deployed the two Mars orbiters in space, the mission's main objective.

      "New Glenn\u2019s inaugural test flight in January delivered a prototype satellite to orbit, but failed to land the booster on its floating platform in the Atlantic.",
      "The identical Mars orbiters, named Escapade, will spend a year hanging out near Earth, stationing themselves 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away. Once Earth and Mars are properly aligned next fall, the duo will get a gravity assist from Earth to head to the red planet, arriving in 2027.",
      "Once around Mars, the spacecraft will map the planet\u2019s upper atmosphere and scattered magnetic fields, studying how these realms interact with the solar wind. The observations should shed light on the processes behind the escaping Martian atmosphere, helping to explain how the planet went from wet and warm to dry and dusty. Scientists will also learn how best to protect astronauts against Mars' harsh radiation environment.",

      "It\u2019s a relatively low-budget mission, coming in under $80 million, that's managed and operated by UC Berkeley. NASA saved money by signing up for one of New Glenn\u2019s early flights. The Mars orbiters should have blasted off last fall, but NASA passed up that ideal launch window \u2014 Earth and Mars line up for a quick transit just every two years \u2014 because of feared delays with Blue Origin's brand-new rocket.",
      "Named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit the world, New Glenn is five times bigger than the New Shepard rockets sending wealthy clients to the edge of space from West Texas.

      "Several lawsuits emerged across the U.S. \u2014 and were later consolidated \u2014 after AT&T notified millions of customers that information ranging from Social Security numbers to call records were compromised in these breaches last year. Plaintiffs alleged that the telecommunications giant \u201crepeatedly failed\u201d to protect consumer data. While AT&T has continued to deny wrongdoing, it opted to settle earlier this year.",

      "The other breach involved call and text records of nearly all AT&T customers from May through October of 2022, as well as a small subset from Jan. 2, 2023. AT&T said it learned that data was \u201cillegally downloaded from our workspace on a third-party cloud platform\u201d in April of last year \u2014 and began notifying customers in July 2024, after launching an investigation.

      "Scientists are trying a revolutionary new approach to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and other devastating autoimmune diseases \u2014 by reprogramming patients\u2019 out-of-whack immune systems.",
      "When your body\u2019s immune cells attack you instead of protecting you, today\u2019s treatments tamp down the friendly fire but they don\u2019t fix what\u2019s causing it. Patients face a lifetime of pricey pills, shots or infusions with some serious side effects \u2014 and too often the drugs aren\u2019t enough to keep their disease in check.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new era,\u201d said Dr. Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University who\u2019s studying some of the possible new treatments. They offer \u201cthe chance to control disease in a way we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",
      "How? Researchers are altering dysfunctional immune systems, not just suppressing them, in a variety of ways that aim to be more potent and more precise than current therapies.",
      "They\u2019re highly experimental and, because of potential side effects, so far largely restricted to patients who\u2019ve exhausted today\u2019s treatments. But people entering early-stage studies are grasping for hope.",
      "\u201cWhat the heck is wrong with my body?\u201d Mileydy Gonzalez, 35, of New York remembers crying, frustrated that nothing was helping her daily lupus pain.",
      "Diagnosed at 24, her disease was worsening, attacking her lungs and kidneys. Gonzalez had trouble breathing, needed help to stand and walk and couldn\u2019t pick up her 3-year-old son when last July, her doctor at NYU Langone Health suggested the hospital\u2019s study using a treatment adapted from cancer.",
      "Gonzalez had never heard of that CAR-T therapy but decided, \u201cI\u2019m going to trust you.\u201d Over several months, she slowly regained energy and strength.",
      "\u201cI can actually run, I can chase my kid,\u201d said Gonzalez, who now is pain- and pill-free. \u201cI had forgotten what it was to be me.\u201d",
      "CAR-T was developed to wipe out hard-to-treat blood cancers. But the cells that go bad in leukemias and lymphomas \u2014 immune cells called B cells \u2014 go awry in a different way in many autoimmune diseases.",
      "Some U.S. studies in mice suggested CAR-T therapy might help those diseases. Then in Germany, Dr. Georg Schett at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg tried it with a severely ill young woman who had failed other lupus treatment. After one infusion, she\u2019s been in remission \u2014 with no other medicine \u2014 since March 2021.",
      "Last month, Schett told a meeting of the American College of Rheumatology how his team gradually treated a few dozen more patients, with additional diseases such as myositis and scleroderma \u2014 and few relapses so far.",
      "Those early results were \u201cshocking,\u201d Hopkins\u2019 Konig recalled.",
      "They led to an explosion of clinical trials testing CAR-T therapy in the U.S. and abroad for a growing list of autoimmune diseases.",
      "How it works: Immune soldiers called T cells are filtered out of a patient\u2019s blood and sent to a lab, where they\u2019re programmed to destroy their B cell relatives. After some chemotherapy to wipe out additional immune cells, millions of copies of those \u201cliving drugs\u201d are infused back into the patient.",
      "While autoimmune drugs can target certain B cells, experts say they can\u2019t get rid of those hidden deep in the body. CAR-T therapy targets both the problem B cells and healthy ones that might eventually run amok. Schett theorizes that the deep depletion reboots the immune system so when new B cells eventually form, they\u2019re healthy.",
      "CAR-T is grueling, time consuming and costly, in part because it is customized. A CAR-T cancer treatment can cost $500,000. Now some companies are testing off-the-shelf versions, made in advance using cells from healthy donors.",
      "Another approach uses \u201cpeacekeeper\u201d cells at the center of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize. Regulatory T cells are a rare subset of T cells that tamp down inflammation and help hold back other cells that mistakenly attack healthy tissue. Some biotech companies are engineering cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases not to attack, like CAR-T does, but to calm autoimmune reactions.",
      "Scientists also are repurposing another cancer treatment, drugs called T cell engagers, that don\u2019t require custom engineering. These lab-made antibodies act like a matchmaker. They redirect the body's existing T cells to target antibody-producing B cells, said Erlangen's Dr. Ricardo Grieshaber-Bouyer, who works with Schett and also studies possible alternatives to CAR-T.",

      "Rather than wiping out swaths of the immune system, Hopkins\u2019 Konig aims to get more precise, targeting \u201conly that very small population of rogue cells that really causes the damage.\u201d",

      "Nearby in another Hopkins lab, biomedical engineer Jordan Green is crafting a way for the immune system to reprogram itself with the help of instructions delivered by messenger RNA, or mRNA, the genetic code used in COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "In Green's lab, a computer screen shines with brightly colored dots that resemble a galaxy. It\u2019s a biological map that shows insulin-producing cells in the pancreas of a mouse. Red marks rogue T cells that destroy insulin production. Yellow indicates those peacemaker regulatory T cells \u2014 and they're outnumbered.",
      "Green's team aims to use that mRNA to instruct certain immune \u201cgenerals\u201d to curb the bad T cells and send in more peacemakers. They package the mRNA in biodegradable nanoparticles that can be injected like a drug. When the right immune cells get the messages, the hope is they'd \u201cdivide, divide, divide and make a whole army of healthy cells that then help treat the disease,\" Green said.",

      "Deane studies rheumatoid arthritis and hopes to find a similar way to block the joint-destroying disease.",
      "About 30% of people with a certain self-reactive antibody in their blood will eventually develop RA. A new study tracked some of those people for seven years, mapping immune changes leading to the disease long before joints become swollen or painful.",
      "Those changes are potential drug targets, Deane said. While researchers hunt possible compounds to test, he\u2019s leading another study called StopRA: National to find and learn from more at-risk people.",
      "On all these fronts, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of research left to do \u2014 and no guarantees. There are questions about CAR-T's safety and how long its effects last, but it is furthest along in testing.",
      "Allie Rubin, 60, of Boca Raton, Florida, spent three decades battling lupus, including scary hospitalizations when it attacked her spinal cord. But she qualified for CAR-T when she also developed lymphoma \u2014 and while a serious side effect delayed her recovery, next month will mark two years without a sign of either cancer or lupus.",
      "\u201cI just remember I woke up one day and thought, \u2018Oh my god, I don\u2019t feel sick anymore,\u2019\u201d she said.",

      "Imagine you leave the house in the morning, and realize you left the stove on. There's a fire hazard at home, and you're feeling anxious about it. So you turn around and switch it off. The problem is solved, and so is your anxiety.",
      "Climate change doesn't work that way.",
      "It activates different parts of the brain, according to a study published by the National Institutes of Health. While Generalized Anxiety Disorder often involves the part of the brain that handles fear, threat and emotion, climate anxiety activates parts of the brain that help with high cognition, willpower and tenacity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing larger problem that I need to attend to over time and that is largely out of my control,\u201d climate psychologist Thomas Doherty said. \u201dI can\u2019t just flip a switch around climate change.\u201d",
      "The anxiety is more complex than a stove left on, because climate change is a more complex problem. The threat is indefinite, it\u2019s largely out of each person\u2019s control and addressing it requires repeated and variable action.",
      "Doherty, who wrote a book about coping with climate anxiety, said that it isn't inherently negative. It's a natural reaction to a threat, and it's the first step in a cyclical relationship with climate change.",
      "\u201cThe rest of the cycle is ultimately taking some action to resolve the threat as best that we can,\u201d he said.",
      "Newman said that one of the most effective ways to combat climate anxiety is to find other people who are experiencing it too, and to talk about it.",
      "Every year, New York City hosts something called Climate Week. Folks from all over descend upon Manhattan for hundreds of events and panels on energy, the environment and climate change.",
      "Between 15 and 20 people showed up to one event about finding connection and hope in the face of climate change. It was intimate, but so is confiding feelings of dread and isolation with a room full of strangers.",
      "\u201cHow many of you wake up in the morning with feelings of despair or hopelessness?\u201d asked the leader at the front of the room.",

      "The development of the vaccine has been praised as a significant milestone for vaccine access in the country and across the rest of the continent.",
      "Motsoaledi said that while South Africa experienced relatively low levels of cholera, many countries in Africa often hit hard by outbreaks would greatly benefit. He said the COVID-19 pandemic exposed how vulnerable African countries were to pandemics as they relied on imported vaccines.",

      "The bill is expected to pass in the House with Republicans' support.",
      "After months of anticipation, the House is finally set to vote Tuesday on a bill ordering the release of the Justice Department's file on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, whose purported ties to both Democrats and Republicans have fueled speculation across the country and prompted investigations on Capitol Hill seeking to uncover details about the billionaire's network of political and financial connections.",
      "After President Donald Trump reversed course over the weekend -- now urging House Republicans to\u00a0\"vote to release the Epstein files\" -- the bill appears headed for the Senate despite a monthslong campaign by Speaker Mike Johnson to block its release.",
      "Johnson has tried to avoid holding a vote in the lower chamber on the Epstein matter. In late July, Johnson sent the House home a day early for August recess because the House was paralyzed in a stalemate over the Epstein issue.",
      "The speaker also sent the House home for more than 50 days during the longest government shutdown in U.S. history -- delaying the swearing in of Democrat Adelita Grijalva. After the shutdown ended last week, the Arizona Democrat became the 218th signature on the Epstein discharge petition, compelling the speaker to bring a bill co-sponsored by Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna to the floor for a vote this week.",
      "Johnson on Monday continued to raise concerns about the legislation and said he has spoken to Trump \"quite a bit\" about it.",
      "\"[Trump\u2019s] statements speak for themselves,\" Johnson said leaving the House floor on Monday. \"He has nothing, he has never had anything to hide. He and I had the same concern, that we wanted to ensure that victims of these heinous crimes were completely protected from disclosure. Those who don\u2019t want their names to be out there, and I am not sure the discharge petition does that and that\u2019s part of the problem.\"",
      "Asked Monday about the vote, Trump said he's \"all for it,\" and that he would sign it if it reaches his desk.",
      "\"We'll give them everything. Sure. I would let them, let the Senate look at it. Let anybody look at it,\" Trump said of the full Epstein files. \"But don't talk about it too much, because honestly, I don't want to take it away from us.\"",
      "Trump does not need to wait for Congress to act -- he could order the release immediately.",

If it passes in the Senate, it will go to Trump's desk for him to sign it into law.",
      "For months, Johnson has pointed at the House Oversight Committee's inquiry -- claiming that the panel's probe is more far-reaching than the Khanna-Massie bill. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has sought additional documents from the Epstein estate and testimony from Epstein's associates, including former President Bill Clinton.",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has been directing states to implement new guidance as part of President Donald Trump's megabill signed into law in July, which will include new work requirements, decreased eligibility for refugees and states shouldering some of the cost of the program.",
      "Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) published in August suggest that, as a result of the changes, more than 3 million Americans could lose assistance within the next few years.",
      "\"I think millions of people are going to lose food. ... There's no question this is going to create more harm and suffering and hunger,\" Joel Berg, CEO of the nonprofit hunger relief organization Hunger Free America, told ABC News.",
      "New work requirements",
      "Under the megabill, the upper age limit for those who need to meet work requirements was raised from age 54 to 64 for the first time for able-bodied adults without dependents",
      "Additionally, exemptions were changed for parents or other family members with responsibility for a dependent under 18 years old to under 14 years old.",
      "According to CBO estimates, about 1.1 million people will lose SNAP benefits between 2025 and 2034, including 800,000 able-bodied adults through age 64 who don't live with dependents and 300,000 parents or caregivers up to age 64 with children aged 14 and older.",
      "Exemptions were also removed for homeless individuals, veterans and young adults who were in foster care when they turned age 18. Meanwhile, exemptions were added for American Indians.",
      "CBO estimates the removal of these exemptions will lead to a loss of benefits for 300,000 people among those groups.",
      "Berg said these requirements will be harmful because people may have to leave work to visit a government office providing proof of work and potentially losing wages.",
      "\"It's really work reporting requirements, and we know none of these requirements actually increase work,\" Berg said. \"It's adding them for veterans, as if they haven't given enough to the country. It's adding work requirements for parents of teenagers. It's adding work reporting requirements for homeless people. How homeless people are going to be able to get and keep jobs is really beyond me.\"",
      "Berg added that it's important to dispel the myth that all Americans who are on SNAP don't have jobs or participate in work programs.",
      "Data from the 2023 American Community Survey shows the majority of American families receiving SNAP benefits had at least one family member working in the past 12 months.",
      "However, work requirements can reduce program participation. A 2021 report from the National Bureau of Economic Research found SNAP work requirements could lead to up to 53% of eligible adults exiting the program within 18 months.",

      "Additionally, Cuban or Haitian entrants under humanitarian parole, as well as people in the U.S. under the Compact of Free Association -- a series of international agreements between the U.S. and three Pacific Island nations -- are also eligible.",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Federal immigration authorities will expand their enforcement action in North Carolina to Raleigh as soon as Tuesday, the mayor of the state\u2019s capital city said, while Customs and Border Protection agents continue operating in Charlotte following a weekend that saw arrests of more than 130 people in that city.",
      "Mayor Janet Cowell said Monday that she didn\u2019t know how large the operation would be or how long agents would be present. Immigration authorities haven\u2019t spoken about it. The Democrat said in a statement that crime was lower in Raleigh this year compared to last and that public safety was a priority for her and the city council.",
      "\u201cI ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges,\u201d Cowell said in a statement.",
      "U.S. immigration agents arrested more than 130 people over the weekend in a sweep through Charlotte, North Carolina\u2019s largest city, a federal official said Monday.",
      "The movements in North Carolina come after the Trump administration launched immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago. Both of those are deep blue cities in deep blue states run by nationally prominent officials who make no secret of their anger at the White House. The political reasoning there seemed obvious.",
      "But why North Carolina and why was Charlotte the first target there?",
      "Sure the mayor is a Democrat, as is the governor, but neither is known for wading into national political battles. In a state where divided government has become the norm, Gov. Josh Stein in particular has tried hard to get along with the GOP-controlled state legislature. The state's two U.S. senators are both Republican and President Donald Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said it is focusing on North Carolina because of so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local authorities and immigration agents.",
      "But maybe focusing on a place where politics is less outwardly bloody was part of the equation.",
      "The White House \u201ccan have enough opposition (to its crackdown), but it's a weaker version\" than what it faced in places like Chicago, said Rick Su, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who studies local government, immigration and federalism.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not interested in just deporting people. They\u2019re interested in the show,\u201d he said.",
      "The Trump administration has made Charlotte, a Democratic city of about 950,000 people, its latest focus for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime \u2014 despite local opposition and declining crime rates. Residents reported encounters with immigration agents near churches, apartment complexes and stores.",
      "Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Border Patrol officers had arrested \u201cover 130 illegal aliens who have all broken\u201d immigration laws. The agency said the records of those arrested included gang membership, aggravated assault, shoplifting and other crimes, but it did not say how many cases had resulted in convictions, how many people had been facing charges or any other details.",
      "The crackdown set off fierce objections from area leaders.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color,\u201d Stein said in a video statement late Sunday. \u201cThis is not making us safer. It\u2019s stoking fear and dividing our community.\u201d",
      "Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said Monday she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about videos she\u2019s seen of the crackdown but also said she appreciates protesters\u2019 peacefulness.",

Nevertheless, some common, noncooperation policies have existed in a handful of places, including Charlotte, where the police do not help with immigration enforcement.",

      "President Donald Trump is facing criticism for not condemning antisemitism within the conservative movement",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like someone, he knows how to show it. In just the last few days, he\u2019s described Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as a traitor, mocked Rep. Thomas Massie\u2019s second marriage after his first wife died and demanded that comedian Seth Meyers get fired from his late-night television show.",
      "But he had nothing bad to say about two people roiling his party: white nationalist Nick Fuentes and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson. The former Fox News host recently hosted Fuentes for a friendly interview, where he declined to challenge his guest's bigoted beliefs or a remark about problems with \u201corganized Jewry in America.\u201d",
      "Asked about the controversy that has been rippling through Republican circles for weeks, Trump did not criticize Fuentes and praised Carlson for having \u201csaid good things about me over the years.\u201d",
      "The president\u2019s answer echoes his longstanding reluctance to disavow \u2014 and sometimes, his willingness to embrace \u2014 right-wing figures who have inched their way from the political fringe to the Republican mainstream.",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed in President Trump,\u201d said Morton Klein, president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America, adding that he should \u201crethink and retract\u201d his comments.",
      "The threat of antisemitism, which has percolated across the political spectrum, will likely be a recurring political issue in the coming year, as Democrats and Republicans battle for control of Congress in the midterms. Although Trump has targeted left-wing campus activism as a hive of anti-Jewish sentiment, Fuentes' influence is a test of whether conservatives are willing to accommodate bigots as part of their political coalition.",
      "The turmoil has already engulfed the Heritage Foundation, a leading think tank whose president Kevin Roberts initially refused to distance himself from Carlson. A member of Heritage's board of trustees, Robert George, announced his resignation Monday, which followed a recent decision by an antisemitism task force to sever its ties with the organization.",
      "Although Roberts has apologized, George said \u201cwe reached an impasse\u201d because he didn't fully retract his original support for Carlson.",
      "\u201cI pray that Heritage\u2019s research and advocacy will be guided by the conviction that each and every member of the human family, irrespective of race, ethnicity, religion, or anything else, as a creature fashioned in the very image of God, is 'created equal' and \u2018endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights,\u2019\" George wrote on Facebook, quoting the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Laurie Cardoza-Moore, an evangelical conservative activist and film producer, joined Heritage's antisemitism task force in June but stepped away when Roberts refused to resign.",
      "\u201cIf we aren\u2019t solid on condemning antisemitism, shame on us,\u201d she said Monday.",

      "\"We can all agree \u2014 and I wish \u2014 that he would have gone further,\u201d she said.",
      "It's unclear what kind of pressure Trump will face despite his previous dalliance with Fuentes, who had dinner with the past-and-future president at his Mar-a-Lago club in between his two terms.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think President Trump during his first or second term could be acting more strongly to prevent antisemitism,\u201d said Matthew Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition. He noted Trump\u2019s first-term relocation of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and, more recently, the president's handling of the war in Gaza.",
      "This is not the first time Trump has shied away from criticizing fringe elements on the right. During his first campaign for president, Trump initially declined to disavow support from white nationalist David Duke, saying, \u201cI just don\u2019t know anything about him.\u201d",

      "The U.S.-Saudi relationship had been sent into a tailspin by the operation targeting Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the kingdom, that U.S. intelligence agencies later determined Prince Mohammed likely directed the agents to carry out.",
      "But seven years later, the dark clouds over the relationship have been cleared away. And Trump has tightened his embrace of the 40-year-old crown prince he views as an indispensable player in shaping the Middle East in the decades to come. Prince Mohammed, for his part, denies involvement in the killing of Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen and Virginia resident.",
      "Khashoggi will likely be an afterthought as the two leaders unveil billions of dollars in deals and huddle with aides to discuss the tricky path ahead in a volatile Middle East. They'll end their day with an evening White House soiree, organized by first lady Melania Trump, to honor the prince.",
      "\u201cThey have been a great ally,\u201d Trump said of the Saudis on the eve of the visit.",
      "Ahead of Prince Mohammed's arrival, Trump announced he has agreed to sell the Saudis F-35 fighter jets despite some concerns within the administration that the sale could lead to China gaining access to the U.S. technology behind the advanced weapon system.",
      "Trump's announcement is also surprising because some in the Republican administration have been wary about upsetting Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge over its neighbors, especially at a time when Trump is depending on Israeli support for the success of his Gaza peace plan.",
      "But the unexpected move comes at a moment when Trump is trying to nudge the Saudis toward normalizing relations with Israel.",
      "The president in his first term had helped forge commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates through an effort dubbed the Abraham Accords.",
      "Trump sees expansion of the accords as essential to his broader efforts to build stability in the Middle East after the two-year Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "And getting Saudi Arabia \u2014 the largest Arab economy and the birthplace of Islam \u2014 to sign on would create an enormous domino effect, he argues. The president in recent weeks has even predicted that once Saudi Arabia signs on to the accords, \u201ceverybody\u201d in the Arab world \u201cgoes in.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump isn't ruling out military action against Venezuela despite bringing up potential diplomatic talks with its leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday did not rule out military action against Venezuela despite bringing up a potential diplomatic opening with leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has insisted that a U.S. military buildup and strikes on alleged drug boats near his South American country are designed to push him out of office.",
      "Trump reiterated that he \u201cprobably would talk to\u201d Maduro, but underscored that he is not taking off the table the possibility of military action on Venezuelan territory. Hours later, Maduro said he is open to dialogue with the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t rule out that. I don\u2019t rule out anything,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office a day after he first floated the possibility of having \u201cdiscussions\u201d with Maduro. Trump, however, sidestepped questions about whether Maduro could say anything to him that would lead to the U.S. backing off its military show of force.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done tremendous damage to our country,\u201d said Trump, tying Maduro to drugs and migrants coming into the U.S. from Venezuela. \u201cHe has not been good to the United States, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",
      "The comments from both leaders deepened the uncertainty about the Trump administration's next steps toward Maduro's government. The U.S. has ratcheted up the pressure in recent days, saying it was expecting to designate as a terrorist organization a cartel it says is led by Maduro and other high-level Venezuelan government officials.",
      "The USS Gerald R. Ford and accompanying warships arrived in the Caribbean this weekend just as the U.S. military announced its latest in a series of strikes against vessels suspected of transporting drugs.",
      "The administration says its actions are a counterdrug operation meant to stop narcotics from flowing to American cities, but some analysts, Venezuelans and the country\u2019s political opposition see them as an escalating pressure tactic against Maduro.",
      "The Trump administration has shown it \u201ccan turn policy on a dime,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, an expert on U.S. policy toward Venezuela who is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. He pointed to the diplomatic talks the administration held with Iran \u201cright up until the point\u201d that the U.S. military targeted Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in June.",
      "But, Ramsey added, the timing of Trump\u2019s remarks \u2014 after Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s announcement of the impending terrorist designation of the Cartel de los Soles \u2014 underscores that the administration does not want to repeat failed attempts at dialogue.",
      "\u201cThey really want to negotiate from a place of strength, and I think the White House is laying out an ultimatum for Maduro,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cEither he engages in credible talks about a transition, or the U.S. will have no choice but to escalate.\u201d",
      "Maduro has negotiated with the U.S. and Venezuela's political opposition for several years, most notably in the two years before the July 2024 presidential election.

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency says it is redefining the scope of the nation\u2019s bedrock clean water law to limit the amount of wetlands it covers",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday it is redefining the scope of the nation\u2019s bedrock clean water law to limit the wetlands it covers, building on a Supreme Court decision two years ago that removed federal protections for significant areas.",
      "When finalized, the new \"Waters of the United States\" rule will ensure that federal jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act is focused on relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water, such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes, along with wetlands that are connected to such bodies of water, the EPA said.",
      "The new rule will help accelerate economic prosperity while protecting vital water resources, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said at a news conference at agency headquarters. The rule will fully implement the direction provided by the Supreme Court in a case known as Sackett v. EPA, he said. The 2023 ruling sharply limited the federal government\u2019s authority to police water pollution into certain wetlands, and boosted property rights over concerns about clean water in a ruling in favor of an Idaho couple who sought to build a house near a lake.",
      "Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who has pushed to rollback dozens of environmental regulations, said the proposed water rule was not motivated by ideology or partisanship. Instead, the goal was to devise a \u201cclear, simple, prescriptive rule that will stand the test of time,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked why he is confident the rule will be sustained after decades of partisan back-and-forth over water regulation, Zeldin offered a one-word answer: \u201cSackett.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of the big differences from the past, is that you have the Supreme Court weighing in, and we\u2019re following Sackett very closely,\" Zeldin said. \u201cWe\u2019re treating it with respect. The words are being interpreted strictly. We are sticking to the prescriptive language of the Supreme Court decision. And that is a very significant difference from the past.\"",
      "The rule, which faces at least 45 days of public comment, will cut red tape and provide clarity for farmers, ranchers, industry and other private landowners, Zeldin said. The proposal will also protect water quality by striking a balance between federal and state authority, he said, adding that any lands that are removed from federal jurisdiction will still face regulation from states and tribes.",
      "Environmentalists slammed the proposal as a giveaway to industry.",

      "But Zeldin, who has traveled to all 50 states since taking office earlier this year, said concerns about the invasive nature of the water rule have emerged in every state. The Trump administration has listened to concerns from farmers and other groups worried about federal interference in how they use their land, he said, and has moved to set limited, predictable and lasting rules defining which waterways the Clean Water Act protects.",
      "\u201cIf you want to really appreciate the impact of the WOTUS rule \u2014 past, present and future \u2014 I would encourage you to speak to all of those impacted stakeholders, all those impacted landowners,'' Zeldin said.",
      "Testimony that affected him the most came from \u201csome small farmer who\u2019s struggling to make ends meet, and they have no idea whether or not the water on their property is a water of the United States or not,\" Zeldin said. \"Their frustration skyrockets when something on their property and was being interpreted as a water of the United States doesn't make any sense. Then their advocacy and passion really starts coming out.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump sought to shrink the water law\u2019s reach in his first term, while Democratic administrations have expanded federal power to regulate the nation\u2019s lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands and oceans. The change in administrations has created drastic swings in how the water law is interpreted and applied.",
      "The Supreme Court ruling in the Sackett case largely agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s limited approach and led the Biden administration to r ewrite protections to comply with the ruling. Some conservative groups have complained that the revised rule still protected too many wetlands and improperly limited private property rights.",

      "LEBANON, Ind. -- An Indiana homeowner accused of killing a house cleaner who mistakenly arrived at his front door was charged with voluntary manslaughter on Monday in a case that could test the limits of stand-your-ground laws.",
      "Curt Andersen, 62, could face anywhere from 10 to 30 years in prison and a $10,000 fine if he's convicted. He was being held in the Boone County Jail pending an initial court hearing.",
      "Officers found Maria Florinda Rios Perez De Velasquez, 32, dead on the front porch of a home in Whitestown, an Indianapolis suburb, on Nov. 5. Authorities said the Guatemalan immigrant was part of a cleaning crew that went to the wrong house just before 7 a.m.",
      "Andersen shot her through the front door with no warning about a minute after hearing someone trying to unlock the door, according to a probable cause statement.",
      "Rios\u2019 husband told media outlets that he was with her on the porch. He didn\u2019t realize she had been shot until she fell back into his arms, bleeding. On a fundraising page, her brother described Rios as a mother of four children.",
      "Indiana is one of 31 states with a stand-your-ground law that permits homeowners to use deadly force to stop someone they believe is trying to unlawfully enter their dwelling. But police said that there's no evidence Rios entered the home before she was shot.",
      "Andersen's attorney, Guy Relford, posted a statement on X saying he was disappointed that prosecutors charged his client. He said Andersen had every reason to believe his actions were justified and the stand-your-ground law clearly protects him.",
      "\u201cMr. Andersen's actions must be evaluated based on the circumstances as he perceived them,\u201d Relford said in the statement.",
      "Boone County Prosecutor Kent Eastwood told reporters at a news conference that the decision to charge Andersen wasn't difficult. Stand-your-ground protections don't apply because Andersen lacked enough information to know if his actions were reasonable, Eastwood said.",
      "The prosecutor said he planned to prove that Andersen couldn\u2019t have reasonably believed he needed to use deadly force, given what he knew at the time.",
      "According to the probable cause statement, Andersen told investigators that he and his wife were asleep in an upstairs bedroom when he heard a \u201ccommotion at the door\" that grew more intense. He thought someone was using keys or tools on the front door.",
      "Frightened, he went to the top of the stairwell and saw through the home's windows that two people were outside the front door. He said to himself, \u201cWhat am I going to do? It's not going away and I have to do something now.\"",
      "He said he loaded his handgun, went back to the windows and saw the people \u201cthrusting\u201d at the door and getting more aggressive, according to the statement.",
      "He fired one shot toward the door. He said the door never opened and he didn't announce himself or say anything before he pulled the trigger.",
      "When told he had killed Rios, he put his head down on the table and said he didn't mean for anything to happen to anybody.",
      "Andersen's wife, Yoshie Andersen, told investigators that her husband told her that he told a neighbor if anyone tried to break into his house he would shoot them. The probable cause statement does not say when this conversation happened.",

      "Investigators found a bullet hole in the door, but no evidence of any forceful contact with the door itself, the latch or the door frame, according to the probable cause statement.",
      "Rios' husband, Mauricio Velasquez, told investigators that she tried to open the door with keys from their cleaning company, but they unknowingly were at the wrong address. He said they'd been trying to open the door for 30 seconds to a minute before she was shot.",
      "He said they never heard any voices from inside or saw any movement. The couple didn't knock, bang on the door or use force of any kind to enter the home and they never got inside, he said.",
      "The shooting echoes a similar episode in Missouri in 2023 when an 86-year-old man shot Ralph Yarl after the 16-year-old Black teenager came to his door by mistake. Missouri has a similar stand-your-ground law, but prosecutors charged the shooter, Andrew Lester, with first-degree assault and armed criminal action. He ultimately pleaded guilty to second-degree assault and didn\u2019t go to trial.",
      "In New York, which does not have a stand-your-ground law, a man was convicted in 2024 of second-degree murder for fatally shooting a woman inside a car who mistakenly came down the driveway of his rural upstate home.",
      "Jody Madeira, an Indiana University law professor who specializes in gun rights, said last week that the Rios case was \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cexceptionally unusual.\u201d",
      "In general, the public can legally access private property \u2014 including a front porch \u2014 for a legitimate purpose until they are told to leave, Madeira said. For example, a homeowner can\u2019t legally shoot a pizza delivery person or an Amazon driver just for stepping onto their property, she said.",
      "Madeira said Monday that the allegations in the probable cause statement show that Curt Andersen was acting out of fear but that's not enough to invoke the stand-your-ground law. There was no unlawful entry and trying to insert a key into a lock or rattling a doorknob isn't a reasonable justification for firing a shot, she said.",
      "\u201cThe reasonable person says, \u2018hey, I have my phone here, I have other options, I can shout a warning. It\u2019s 7 a.m., is someone really breaking into my house? He jumped up from bed and immediately went into I'm combatting a break-in.\u201d",

      "A federal jury about to hear the drug-trafficking case against a former heavyweight boxer has been abruptly dismissed after three men were charged with trying to bribe a juror with up to $100,000 to return a not guilty verdict",
      "NEW YORK -- Three men were arrested Monday for allegedly trying to pay up to $100,000 in cash to a juror at the Brooklyn drug trial of a former heavyweight boxer, leading a judge to abruptly dismiss the jury as it was about to hear opening statements.",
      "John Marzulli, a spokesperson for federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, said an anonymous jury will be chosen when the trial of Goran Gogic resumes in a month.",
      "Gogic, of Montenegro, was set to stand trial for allegedly conspiring to smuggle 20 tons (18.1 metric tons) of cocaine to Europe from Colombia through U.S. ports using commercial cargo ships. He has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Law enforcement officials have described Gogic as a \u201cmajor drug trafficker\u201d and said he operated on a \u201cmammoth scale.\u201d",
      "A former heavyweight boxer, Gogic fought professionally in Germany from 2001 to 2012, compiling a 21-4-2 record, according to boxing website Sport & Note. He was listed as 6-foot-5 (1.96 meters) and weighed in at anywhere from 227 pounds (103 kilograms) to 250 pounds (113 kilograms).",
      "In a criminal complaint in Brooklyn federal court, an FBI agent wrote that the bribery scheme unfolded between Thursday and Sunday.",
      "According to the court papers, one of the men charged in the plot \u2014 Mustafa Fteja \u2014 already knew a juror described in the complaint as \u201cJohn Doe #1\u201d and called him multiple times on his cellphone Thursday before the juror agreed to meet him in Staten Island.",
      "During the meeting, which took place Thursday, Fteja told the juror that associates in the Bronx were willing to pay him to return a not guilty verdict, the complaint said.",

      "It was not immediately clear who will represent Fteja and two others accused in the alleged jury tampering scheme when they appear in court later Monday.",
      "According to the complaint, investigators secured several recorded conversations of the defendants planning the juror corruption plot as the men spoke in Albanian and English.",
      "At his trial, Gogic is charged with violating and conspiring to violate the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act. If convicted, he faces a sentence of 10 years to life in prison.",
      "According to prosecutors, Gogic and his co-conspirators worked with the ships\u2019 crew members to smuggle cocaine in shipping containers, hoisting loads of the drug from speedboats that approached the cargo vessels along their route, including near ports in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.",
      "Three shipments were intercepted by U.S. law enforcement agents, prosecutors said, including 1,437 kilograms (3,168 pounds) of cocaine aboard the MSC Carlotta at the Port of New York and New Jersey in February 2019 and 17,956 kilograms (39,586 pounds) of cocaine \u2014 with a street value of over $1 billion \u2014 aboard the MSC Gayane at the Port of Philadelphia in June 2019.",

      "Tribal citizens are among communities navigating the impacts of massive cuts in federal spending and the effects of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history",
      "NEW TOWN, N.D. -- On a recent chilly fall morning, Ruth De La Cruz walked through the Four Sisters Garden, looking for Hidatsa squash. To college students in her food sovereignty program, the crop might be an assignment. But to her, it is the literal fruit of her ancestors' labor.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some of the squash, yay,\u201d De La Cruz exclaimed as she finds the small, pumpkinlike gourds catching the morning sun.",
      "The garden is named for the Hidatsa practice of growing squash, corn, sunflower and beans \u2014 the four sisters \u2014 together, De La Cruz said. The program is part of the Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College, operated by the Mandan Hidatsa Arikara Nation.",
      "It is one of more than three dozen tribal colleges and universities across the country that the Trump administration proposed cutting funding to earlier this year. Tribal citizens are among communities navigating the impacts of massive cuts in federal spending and the effects of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.",
      "A funding increase for tribal colleges and universities announced before the shutdown was welcome news, but college leaders remain uneasy about the government\u2019s financial commitments. Those federal dollars are part of some of the country's oldest legal obligations, and tribal college and university (TCU) presidents and Native education advocates worry they could be further eroded, threatening the passage of Indigenous knowledge to new generations.",
      "\u201cThis is not just a haven for access to higher education, but also a place where you get that level of culturally, tribally specific education,\u201d De La Cruz said.",
      "When the U.S. took the land and resources of tribal nations to build the country, it promised through treaties, laws and other acts of Congress that it would uphold the health, education, and security of Indigenous peoples. Those fiduciary commitments are known today as trust responsibilities.",
      "\u201cWe prepaid for all of this,\u201d said Twyla Baker, the college's president.",
      "The U.S. may have intentionally and violently disrupted the passage of Indigenous knowledge and lifeways, Baker said, but their ancestors forced the government to promise to protect them for future generations. Those legal and moral obligations must be honored, she said.",
      "\u201cThey carried our languages under their tongues. They carried them close to their heart. They carried these knowledge systems with them and protected them to bring them forward to us. So I feel as if I have a responsibility to do the same,\u201d Baker said.",
      "Today, the education pillar of the trust responsibilities takes many forms, like the hundreds of elementary schools on reservations funded by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Education and the funding that pays for Native history and language classes taught at TCUs.",
      "That funding was set to be reduced by as much as 90% in President Donald Trump\u2019s federal budget proposal. But in September the U.S. Department of Education announced TCUs would receive an increase of over 100%. While the decision was welcomed by many, those new federal dollars came at the cost of other institutions where many Native students attend, like Hispanic-serving institutions.",
      "The education of Native students outside of TCUs are also part of those trust and treaty rights, said Ahniwake Rose, president of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, which advocates for TCUs.",

      "Rose said that the increase in Department of Education funding coincides with decreases in several areas of the federal government that provide vital grants to TCUs, like the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "In 1994, Congress passed a bill designating tribal colleges as land grant institutions, which opened them up to new sources of federal funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But unlike other land grant universities like Cornell, Purdue and Clemson that are still sustained by the profits of unceded tribal lands, TCUs don\u2019t share in those billions of dollars. Instead they rely on grants from the federal agencies that support land grant universities.",
      "However, that too has become more difficult, Rose said. Tribal liaisons at some of those federal departments who ensure they are complying with their trust responsibilities have been laid off or furloughed, she said, and many of those positions remain unfilled.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still under a great deal of stress,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to think because we got this increase in funds that all is OK, because it\u2019s still precarious.\u201d",
      "That kind of uncertainty makes it hard to budget, said Leander McDonald, president of the United Tribes Technical College in Bismarck, North Dakota. That, mixed with the current push to cut the federal workforce, leaves him and other TCU presidents second-guessing decisions to create education programs and hire staff.",
      "\u201cHow long is the storm going to last?\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that I think is unknown for us.\u201d",
      "Presidents like McDonald and Baker spend a lot of their time on the road, traveling to Washington, D.C., to make the case for both the value that TCUs add and the government\u2019s responsibility to uphold them. An American Indian Higher Education Consortium report released in September found that in 2023 TCUs generated $3.8 billion in added income to the national economy in the forms of increased student and business revenue and social savings related to health, justice and income assistance.",
      "On top of the opportunities higher education provides, for TCU students there is an added incentive. The U.S. government systematically tried to erase their cultures, and many students and faculty believe part of the government\u2019s fiduciary responsibility to tribal nations today includes providing opportunities to sustain the traditions that it threatened.",
      "Learning directly from elders who pass down that knowledge is a key part of the Native American Studies program at Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College. Students like Zaysha Grinnell, a citizen of the MHA Nation enrolled in the program, learn their languages and take classes on tribal sovereignty and traditional burial rites.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t get that anywhere else,\u201d she said. \u201cThat experience, that knowledge, all of the knowledge that the ones teaching here carry.\u201d",
      "Many of the communities where those traditions were taught were broken up, the languages spoken in them were intentionally targeted, and the lands where they thrived were taken, said Mike Barthelemy, head of the college\u2019s Native American Studies program.",
      "\u201cYou can look around us in any direction for hundreds of miles, and those are ceded territories,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single Indigenous nation that got really, truly compensated for what they gave. And so I think that trust responsibility, it lingers.\u201d",

      "Emerson was subdued by the flight crew after trying to cut the engines of a Horizon Air flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco on Oct. 22, 2023, while he was riding in an extra seat in the cockpit. The plane was diverted to Portland, where it landed safely with more than 80 people on board.",
      "After his arrest, Emerson told police he was despondent over a friend\u2019s recent death, had taken psychedelic mushrooms about two days earlier, and hadn\u2019t slept in over 40 hours. He has said he believed he was dreaming at the time and that he was trying to wake himself up by grabbing two red handles that would have activated the plane\u2019s fire suppression system and cut off fuel to its engines.",
      "Before Baggio announced the sentence, Emerson spoke and said he regretted the harm he caused to society.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a victim. I am here as a direct result of my actions,\u201d he told the court. \u201cI can tell you that this very tragic event has forced me to grow as an individual.\u201d",
      "He hugged his attorneys and shared a tearful embrace with his wife after the judge announced she was releasing him, saying his story \u201coffers a cautionary tale worth telling beyond the confines of this case.\u201d",
      "Multiple people spoke on Emerson\u2019s behalf at the hearing, including his wife, Sarah Stretch, who told the judge how the incident had impacted their family.",
      "\u201cI am so sorry for those that it\u2019s impacted as much as it has. But I am extremely proud to be here with this man today, because the growth that he has had from this terrible experience has not only helped him, but benefited all that surround him,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cI just hope people realize that it\u2019s not necessarily the mistake itself but how you respond to it. He has responded with courage, strength and demonstration of extreme resiliency.\u201d",
      "Joseph Emerson had pleaded guilty or no-contest to all charges against him in September as part of agreements with state and federal prosecutors.",

A state indictment in Oregon separately charged him with 83 counts of endangering another person and one count of endangering an aircraft. He was released from custody pending trial in December 2023, with requirements that he undergo mental health services, stay off drugs and alcohol, and keep away from aircraft.",
      "A state court sentenced him to 50 days in jail, with credit for time served, plus five years of probation, 664 hours of community service \u2014 eight hours for each person he endangered \u2014 and over $60,000 in restitution, nearly all of it to Alaska Air Group.",
      "Half of his community service can be performed at the pilot health nonprofit Emerson founded after his arrest.

      "The airline has said that other members of the flight crew had not observed signs of impairment that would have barred Emerson from the cockpit.",

Conditions began to improve throughout last week as more controllers returned to work amid news that Congress was close to a deal to end the shutdown. That progress also prompted the FAA to pause plans for further rate increases.",

      "A new report finds that foreign students enrolled at U.S. colleges in strong numbers this fall despite fears that a Trump administration crackdown would trigger a nosedive",
      "WASHINGTON -- Foreign students enrolled at U.S. colleges in strong numbers this fall despite fears that a Trump administration crackdown would trigger a nosedive, yet there are signs of turbulence as fewer new, first-time students arrived from other countries, according to a new report.",
      "Overall, U.S. campuses saw a 1% decrease in international enrollment this fall compared with last year, according to a survey from the Institute of International Education. But that figure is propped up by large numbers of students who stayed in the U.S. for temporary work after graduating. The number of new students entering the United States for the first time fell by 17%, the sharpest decrease since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Some universities are seeing backslides that have punched big holes in tuition revenue, but overall the falloff is less severe than some industry groups had forecast. Researchers credit colleges for helping students navigate visa issues through the summer.",
      "\u201cI think colleges and universities did absolutely everything in their power to advocate to get these students to the United States,\u201d said Mirka Martel, head of research, evaluation and learning for the institute.",
      "At DePaul University, a Catholic university in Chicago, the number of international graduate students fell by almost 62% this fall, a driving factor in recent spending cuts. The university president blamed student visa troubles and declining interest to study in the U.S., calling it a \u201cmassive\u201d disruption.",
      "Overall, nearly 60% of colleges reported a decrease in new foreign students this fall, the survey found, while 30% saw increases and others held even. More than 800 schools responded to the survey, which offers an early look at trends before full data is released next year.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to reduce America\u2019s reliance on foreign students. The White House is pushing colleges to cap enrollment of foreign students and enroll more from the U.S. In June, the State Department began screening visa applications more closely after temporarily halting all interviews.",
      "Visa processing has continued to lag in some countries, including India, the largest source of America\u2019s foreign students. Education firms have reported that future college students are now showing decreased interest in the U.S. and more in Europe and Asia. While international enrollment remained relatively steady, there are concerns about its sustainability.",
      "\u201cThere are warning signs for future years, and I\u2019m really concerned about what this portends for fall '26 and \u201927,\u201d said Clay Harmon, the executive director of AIRC: The Association of International Enrollment Management, which represents colleges and recruitment agencies.",
      "Foreign students make up about 6% of America\u2019s college students but they play an outsize role in campus budgets. Most pay higher tuition rates and don't get financial aid, effectively subsidizing U.S. students. Their numbers are far higher at elite campuses, often making up a quarter or more of the student body.",
      "International students at the graduate level saw the biggest backslide this fall, with a 12% drop. That was mostly offset by rising numbers of students participating in Optional Practical Training, which allows students to stay in the U.S. for temporary work after graduating. Undergraduate numbers ticked up slightly.",
      "Graduate students make up the biggest share of foreign students in the U.S., often coming for science, math and business programs. Numbers had already started leveling off last year after a post-pandemic surge, but the recent turmoil appears to have accelerated the downturn. In the survey, colleges that saw decreases cite factors including visa issues and other travel restrictions.",

At the University of Michigan, foreign graduate enrollment fell by a similar share. Arizona State University, which has more foreign students than any other public campus, saw its overall numbers fall by 3%.",
      "Universities are offering wider flexibility to students who couldn't make it to campus this fall, according to the survey. Almost three-quarters are allowing foreign students to defer their enrollment to the spring term, and more than half are allowing deferrals until fall 2026.",
      "Colleges in other countries, meanwhile, have sought to capitalize on the disruption, said Joann Ng Hartmann, senior impact officer at NAFSA, an agency that promotes international education.

      "Those are the major takeaways from a series of private conversations, briefings and official talking points involving major Republican decision-makers across Washington, including inside the White House, after their party's losses Nov. 4. Their assessment highlights the extent to which the fate of the Republican Party is tied to Trump, a term-limited president who insists the economy under his watch has never been stronger.",

But Trump's primary message is that the economy is better and consumer prices lower than as reported by the media. It\u2019s much the same message that Democratic President Joe Biden and his allies spent years pushing, with little success.",

Parasocial is defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",

      "An influencer blocks traffic for the sake of \"content\"",
      "Around 3:12 a.m. Saturday, Miami Beach Police officers were conducting a high-visibility detail along the 700 block of Washington Avenue within the city's Entertainment District, when a group of individuals entered the roadway from the east sidewalk into the northbound lanes. A man from the group -- later identified as Doherty -- separated from them and attempted to engage officers to \"create video content, positioning himself in the middle of the roadway with passing vehicular traffic and creating a significant safety hazard,\" according to arrest documents obtained by CBS News Miami.",
      "Miami Beach Police officers began issuing multiple commands to direct Doherty to exit the roadway, but he refused. Even after his group urged him to comply, he continued refusing officers' commands.",
      "Officers continued, warning Doherty that failure to comply would result in his arrest. Still, the influencer continued to refuse commands and told them, \"Once I'm done with this bet,\" the arrest documents said. At this moment, Miami Beach Police safely apprehended Doherty in the middle of the road due to his \"deliberate refusal to follow lawful orders and continued to obstruct traffic.\"",
      "According to arrest documents, while officers searched Doherty's person, they found \"half of an orange oval-shaped pill with 3 imprinted on it, consistent with a Schedule II amphetamine, as well as a black plastic container holding three hand-rolled suspected cannabis cigarettes weighing approximately 4.0 grams combined.\"",
      "After a records check that showed no active warrants, officers took Doherty to Miami Beach Police's holding facility for booking and contacted an after-hours attorney for charging guidance.",

      "In \"Defying Gravity: The Creative Career of Stephen Schwartz, from Godspell to Wicked\" (published by Applause Books), biographer Carol de Giere explores the life and work of the Grammy- and Oscar-winning composer of treasured Broadway and movie hits.",
      "Read an excerpt below, in which Schwartz finds the inspiration of what will become his most successful musical production to date, when he discovers Gregory Maguire's prequel to L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" \u2013 the genesis of the long-running Broadway musical \"Wicked.\"",
      "And don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Stephen Schwartz on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 16!",
      "\"Defying Gravity\" by Carol de Giere",
      "Landing in Oz",
      "\"It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap!\" \u2014Wicked",
      "At the start of 1996, Stephen Schwartz never imagined he would end the year envisioning his next Broadway musical, Wicked. Movie songwriting seemed to be his future, especially after one eventful evening in March. He donned his newly-purchased black tuxedo and white silk dress shirt, strode across the red carpet, and met up with his Pocahontas writing partner Alan Menken at Los Angeles' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. For forty-eight-year-old Schwartz, being nominated for an Academy Award was a welcome twist on his childhood dream of writing musicals for the stage. With his parents and wife in the audience, he waited for the announcement.",
      "\"And the Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score goes to\u2026\" An expectant silence settled in the hall while presenter Quincy Jones opened the envelope.",
      "\"Alan Menken, musical and orchestral score, and Stephen Schwartz, lyrics, for Pocahontas.\" Applause burst out while the pair made their way to the stage. As Menken thanked their Pocahontas music team, Schwartz clutched his golden statuette and smiled, looking down at Mel Gibson in the front row making funny faces at him and soaking in the acknowledgment from Hollywood. That evening he and Menken also stepped up to accept the award for Best Original Song, \"Colors of the Wind.\"",
      "Back home in Connecticut, he placed his gold-plated statuettes beside his Grammy gramophones in a trophy case converted from an aquarium that his kids no longer used.",
      "The rest of the year was a busy one, with the premiere of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and early work on The Prince of Egypt involving meetings with the DreamWorks team and the writing and demo-ing of songs. He was also working on an early production of a revue musical Snapshots in Seattle, confident that when finally finished, the show would go direct to stock and amateur licensing rather than to a commercial production. The one thing he was emphatically not doing was planning anything new for Broadway.",
      "Then towards the end of the year, a phone call came that would change everything. He was in Los Angeles finishing some work on The Prince of Egypt when his long-time buddy, songwriter John Bucchino, called him from the island of Maui in Hawaii. Singer-songwriter Holly Near had hired Bucchino as a piano accompanist for her performances at a conference at the tropical getaway. Once on Maui, Bucchino decided it was too good not to share. His room included an extra bed, and he had a car and free food. \"If you can cash in some frequent flyer miles and come for the weekend, you'll have a free vacation in Hawaii,\" Bucchino offered.",
      "\"Why not?\" thought Schwartz. He had the weekend free, and after all, it was Hawaii. \"I am so there,\" came Schwartz's answer from LA, and by December 16th, he was.",
      "When Bucchino and Near had a block of time away from the stage, they organized a snorkeling adventure with Schwartz and Near's friend, Pat Hunt. A small boat sped them over to Molikini, a mostly submerged volcanic crater popular for its rainbow spread of sea creatures that delight snorkelers.",
      "On the trip back, Holly casually mentioned to Stephen, \"I'm reading this really interesting book called Wicked, by Gregory Maguire.\"",
      "The novel's title sounded intriguing. \"I think I've heard of it. What's it about?\" he inquired.",
      "\"It's the Oz story from the Wicked Witch of the West's point of view.\"",
      "In an instant, Schwartz's imagination flashed through the implications of a backstory for The Wizard of Oz told from the perspective of the unpopular witch. His reaction was visceral: \"All the hairs on my arms stood on end,\" he recalls. \"I thought it was the best idea for a musical I had ever heard.\"",
      "As soon as he returned to his LA apartment, he called his attorney in New York, inquiring about Maguire's 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. \"Okay, this book has been out for a while, so somebody has the rights. I need you to find out who has them. Meanwhile, I'm going to get the book and read it, because I think I have to do this.\"",
      "There was no way around it. This was a Broadway concept not suited to a small-budget theater company. And he knew it was a highly theatrical idea, not one meant for film or television. Although he had firmly decided, indeed pledged, never to work on Broadway again, his instincts didn't leave him a choice.",
      "But with such a popular novel, surely someone in Hollywood was converting it to the silver screen. Schwartz would have to stop them, and somehow inspire the rights holders to consider instead the risky, expensive, and time-consuming venture of producing a musical in New York City.",
      "While his attorney, Nancy Rose, followed clues on the rights trail, Wicked's prospective composer-lyricist read the novel and confirmed that his hunch had been right: musicalizing the Wicked Witch's story seemed \"quintessentially an idea for me,\" meaningful enough to be worth the potential struggle.",
      "For one thing, he loved looking at traditional stories from a new angle. When he was in college he saw Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Tom Stoppard's play in which two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet are made the central characters. \"It was a revelation to me,\" he recalls. \"From that point on, the idea of looking at familiar material from an unfamiliar point of view became a goal for my own work.\" Godspell had approached the New Testament in a fresh way, Children of Eden reworked Genesis for a new take on family life, and The Prince of Egypt explored the Exodus story from the standpoint of the brother relationship between Moses and Ramses. But Gregory Maguire's twist on The Wizard of Oz was a chance to do something more directly like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern concept. \"I recognized immediately that this was a genius idea and that it was an idea for me: the way it took a familiar subject and spun it,\" Schwartz recalls.",
      "Wicked also felt inherently musical to him. \"Elphaba is a very musical character with big emotions. She is fantastical. The world is fantastical. Glinda is very musical.\" To him it was clear that the world of musical theater was where the story belonged.",
      "And then there was the character Maguire's vision had moved to the center of the story: Elphaba, the quirky and misunderstood green girl who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Maguire named her after L. Frank Baum, who penned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, when he pondered the sound of the author's initials \"eL\" \"Fa\" \"Ba.\" Elphaba's story seemed close to Schwartz's own emotional experience. He knew what it felt like to be \"green\" and what inner resources are needed to carry on with life. \"The idea of the story created a sympathetic resonance in me,\" Schwartz affirms, \"and I know that I'm not alone. Anyone who is an artist in our society is going to identify with Elphaba. Anyone who is of an ethnic minority, who is black or Jewish or gay, or a woman feeling she grew up in a man's world, or anyone who grew up feeling a dissonance between who they are inside and the world around them, will identify with Elphaba. Since that's so many of us, I think there will be a lot of people who will.\"",
      "\"There were things that I knew right away. I knew how it was going to begin, I knew how it was going to end, I knew who Elphaba was, and I knew why\u2014 on some strange level\u2014this was autobiographical even though it was about a green girl in Oz.\" \u2014Stephen Schwartz",
      "Schwartz bought a spiral notebook in which he would capture all his story and lyric ideas\u2014snatches of inspiration, research notes, lists of rhyming words, first drafts of lyric lines, and later drafts. On the black cover, the manufacturer's slogan, \"Five Star\u2014In a Class By Itself,\" hinted at what would become of the musical that began as penciled scrawls on the lined pages.",
      "Maguire had created, as the author himself described it, a dense, almost nineteenth-century-type novel that takes place over thirty-eight years and has thirty-eight speaking parts. Could any group of musical collaborators successfully distill these ingredients into a viable evening of theater?",

    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

    "summary": "The composer and lyricist behind such hits as \"Godspell,\" \"Pippin\" and \"Wicked\" talks about the price of his early success, and why he almost left composing Broadway musicals for good.",
    "story": [
      "When songwriter Stephen Schwartz sits at the piano, he feels the music. \"When I was a kid and playing my Beethoven \u2026 I would play that bar over and over again, and cry. It's very embarrassing! Beethoven, living in a world that has nothing to do with ours, but he writes, and it speaks to us across the centuries.\"",
      "Schwartz knows a little something about speaking to audiences. He's the composer and lyricist of \"Wicked,\" the blockbuster stage musical-turned-two-part movie musical. Part two, \"Wicked: For Good,\" opens Nov. 21.",
      "The prequel to the classic \"Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" tells the story of Elphaba (played by Cynthia Erivo), who grows up to be the Wicked Witch of the West. The bubbly Glinda (played by Ariana Grande) becomes the Good Witch of the North.",
      "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo perform \"Popular,\" from \"Wicked\":",
      "Schwartz has been telling stories through song for over five decades. \"My sort of glib joke where people say, like, how do you write a song? I just say, tell the truth and make it rhyme,\" he said. \"And if I can be honest enough, then that'll speak to other people.\"",
      "\"Wicked\" opened 22 years ago, making it the fourth-longest-running Broadway show in history.",
      "And where was Schwartz on the night of Oct. 30, 2003? \"Well, that was the opening night of 'Wicked' on Broadway, and therefore, I was not at the Gershwin Theatre, because I don't go to my own openings,\" he said. \"It's too nerve-wracking for me. I don't like the opening night parties where everybody is just waiting to hear what reviews come in.\"",
      "Kristin Chenoweth originated the role of Glinda on Broadway. She and Schwartz have reunited for the recently-opened new musical, \"The Queen of Versailles.\" \"I'm working with my Rodgers and Hammerstein; it's just packed into one person,\" she said of Schwartz. \"There's not five of him. There's one. He's original. He's singular. And there's nobody else like him.\"",
      "Schwartz grew up on New York's Long Island. A prodigy, he attended the prestigious Juilliard School as a high schooler. Just after college, he collaborated on the musical that became his first big hit, \"Godspell.\" The musical features a ragtag group who help Jesus tell various parables.",
      "I asked, \"It's a musical with Jesus as a central character. You're a Jewish guy. Did you think, well, alright, I'll give it a go?\"",
      "Schwartz replied, \"I think one of the things that made 'Godspell' work was the fact that I didn't know a lot of those stories. So, I think I came to it with a kind of fresh eye about not preaching to the converted, so to speak.\"",
      "In 1972, Schwartz brought that fresh eye to the story of \"Pippin,\" a young man searching for the meaning of life in the Middle Ages. Hit #3, 1974's \"The Magic Show,\" starred magician Doug Henning. Schwartz was 3-for-3, with all three playing simultaneously on Broadway when he was just 27 \u2013 a theatrical trifecta that Schwartz described as \"very dizzying.\"",
      "\"The truth is, when you are very young and unprepared for a success, it can be difficult to handle,\" he said. \"It was difficult for me to handle. I think I got very, quite full of myself. I got kind of difficult to deal with. I kept thinking, well, why isn't everybody just doing exactly what I say? I lost somewhat the ability to collaborate. You know, it took some failures to kind of learn how to deal with both success and failure.\"",
      "The failures came in short order, a \"four-fecta\" of flops\": \"Working\" (which closed after a month), and 'Rags\" (which closed after four performances), while \"The Baker's Wife\" and \"Children of Eden\" never made it to Broadway.",
      "I noted, \"You haven't always been critic's choice.\"",
      "\"I'm almost never a critic's choice,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Why? \"I have no idea,\" he said. \"I'll be frank about it, you know, I wish I got Steve Sondheim's reviews.\"",
      "\"But listen, as great as he was, his shows didn't run the way yours have.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the grass is always greener,\" Schwartz replied.",
      "In the early 1990s Schwartz stepped away from the piano. Had he quit Broadway? \"Absolutely, a hundred percent,\" he said.",
      "\"Did you worry that you were out of juice?\" I asked.",

    "story": [
      "The Vatican shared the spotlight with Hollywood on Saturday as Pope Leo XIV hosted dozens of stars, including Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee and Monica Bellucci for a special audience celebrating the power of cinema.",
      "The event, organized by the Vatican's culture ministry, took place in a frescoed Vatican audience hall. Leo called on the attending artists to use their art to include marginalized voices and praised film to console and challenge audiences.",
      "\"It articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express,\" Leo said.",
      "The first U.S.-born pope also acknowledged the financial difficulties facing movie theaters. He said institutions should not give up, but \"cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\" of theaters, drawing applause from the audience.",
      "\"His speech was beautiful and very inspiring, about hope and our work in cinema. We're glad we came,\" said Judd Apatow, who attended the audience with his wife and fellow Hollywood star Leslie Mann.",
      "\"It was so inspiring,\" Mann added.",
      "Leo spent nearly an hour greeting guests and making conversation with each attendee. Lee, a basketball lover, gifted the pontiff a New York Knicks jersey that featured the No. 14 and Leo's name on the back. Leo may be a known Chicago Bulls fan, but Lee said he told the pope that the Knicks' current roster includes three players from Villanova University, the Holy Father's alma mater. Lee said Leo's words about film were \"very, very moving.\"",
      "Pope Francis held similar audiences with artists and comedians. The audiences are part of the Vatican's efforts to reach out beyond the Catholic Church to engage with the secular world.",
      "A pope who \"grew up with cinema\"",
      "Leo is the first American-born Pope and grew up during Hollywood's heyday. Earlier this week, he listed his four favorite movies: \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"The Sound of Music,\" \"Ordinary People,\" and \"Life Is Beautiful,\" all classics that celebrate love and hope in the face of darkness. Leo will also be the subject of his own movie, a documentary from the Vatican that traces his life from Chicago to St. Peter's.",
      "\"He is a pope who grew up with television and grew up with cinema, and it's a natural (medium) to tell his story,\" said Monsignor Paul Tighe, the Vatican's culture secretary, in a conversation with CBS Saturday Morning.",
      "Tighe said the large group of filmmakers and actors was pulled together during the last three months. Vatican officials used contacts in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, to help craft the list of attendees. The hardest part, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation wasn't a hoax. Tighe told CBS Saturday Morning that he hopes the event shows that the Church embraces the arts, instead of just tolerating them.",
      "\"We have to trust that the artist, even when he or she is being provocative, is trying to wake us up, grab our attention, and make us think about things that are important,\" Tighe said.",

      "Grande, 32, began her career as a teen on Broadway before embarking on a hugely successful pop career. At perhaps the height of her meteoric pop fame in 2017, one of her concerts was bombed. The Manchester Arena attack killed 22 people, wounded more than 1,000 and left Grande with PTSD.",

      "According to experts, the bite of a Lone Star tick can lead an individual to develop a sensitivity or allergy to alpha galactose, a carbohydrate found in red meat and dairy products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says AGS\u00a0can cause hives, nausea, stomach pain, breathing issues and swelling.",
      "Man died several hours after eating hamburger at barbecue",
      "According to researchers, a 47-year-old New Jersey man went on a camping trip with his wife and children in summer 2024, and after spending the day outdoors, they had beef steak for dinner. About four hours later, researchers say the man experienced severe abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and vomiting that lasted about two hours.",
      "The man apparently felt better the following morning, but when discussing what had happened with his family, he allegedly said, \"I thought I was going to die.\" However, he decided not to consult a doctor about the symptoms, researchers say.",
      "About two weeks later, researchers say the man attended a barbecue where he ate a hamburger. About four hours after eating, the man was found unconscious on the bathroom floor with vomit around him. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead several hours later.",

      "Postmortem blood test reveals allergic reaction to alpha-gal",
      "The man's death was ruled a \"sudden unexplained death,\" but his wife asked a friend in the medical field to review the autopsy report. The doctor contacted researchers in Virginia to look into the possible role of AGS.",
      "Earlier this year, the man's blood was tested, and researchers say it was determined he had suffered an allergic reaction to alpha-gal consistent with fatal anaphylaxis.",
      "The man's wife said that earlier in the summer, he had gotten about a dozen bug bites around his ankles believed to be from Lone Star tick larvae.",
      "According to researchers, this is \"the first documented anaphylactic death related to AGS where the symptoms started several hours after consuming mammalian meat.\"",
      "Doctors want to raise awareness of alpha-gal syndrome",
      "The researchers argue more public education on AGS is necessary, considering the increased presence of Lone Star ticks in northern states and the fact that abdominal pain is not widely recognized as a possible symptom of an allergic reaction.",
      "\"Although this is very, very uncommon\u2013 what happened to him is not likely to happen to other people. I'm not afraid of that,\" said Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills with UVA Health. \"But they should know about it.\"",
      "\"If they start noticing they're developing abdominal pain, rashes after eating red meat, they should talk to their physicians about the possibility that they've been sensitized to this specific carbohydrate within red meat,\" said Dr. Suraj Saggar, chief of infectious disease at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, \"and understand that if they continue to eat it, there is at least the potential for having a very serious and even fatal reaction.\"",
      "Experts say people who live in areas where Lone Star ticks are common, like New York and New Jersey, should do what they can to avoid tick bites.",
      "\"With the changing seasons, the warming of our climate, these ticks are increasing in their numbers. The potential exposures are increasing,\" Saggar said. \"People should take all the precautions they can to protect [from] tick bites.\"",

    "summary": "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries called GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene an\u00a0ally during the shutdown for joining Democrats in demanding that Congress address high health care costs.",
    "story": [
      "Like many of her Democratic colleagues, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is urging Congress to act quickly to address the spiraling cost of health care for millions of Americans who could soon see huge spikes in their insurance premiums.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview Friday. \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",
      "About 22 million lower- and middle-income Americans rely on the tax credits to reduce their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. During the longest government shutdown in history, Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but the shutdown ultimately ended Wednesday without a deal to extend the tax credits. Democrats were promised, however, that a vote on the tax credits will be held next month.",
      "But House Democrats took notice of Greene's views on health care. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he had found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse, replied,\"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "And top Republicans noticed, too. Earlier this week, President Trump said of Greene after she criticized him for focusing on foreign policy, rather than high prices at home, \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "\"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone.\" But she added that the rapidly rising health insurance costs had affected her personally.",
      "\"As far as health insurance is concern it hurt my own family. Back in 2010, the Democrats passed Obamacare, and in 2014 when it went into effect my family's health insurance went from $800 to over $2,400 a month, and we've seen the health insurance industry prices just go up and up,\" Greene said.",
      "\"I see simply that the American people have been done wrong, and I want my party to produce a solution and a plan that fixes this mess once and for all,\" Greene said. \"And so that is what I've been urging here in Washington, and I really hope to see Republicans and Democrats both work together to come up with a very good solution with health care for the American people.\"",

      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age.

      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

      "Tokyo\u00a0\u2014 Japan said Monday that it had scrambled aircraft after detecting a suspected Chinese drone near its southern island of Yonaguni, which is close to Taiwan, on Saturday, as tension between the Asian adversaries spiked.",
      "On Sunday, Chinese coast guard vessels spent several hours in Japan's territorial waters around the disputed Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu in China and a frequent flashpoint, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said.",
      "The incidents came amid escalating tension between the neighbors over remarks by Japan's staunchly conservative new leader, who suggested Tokyo could intervene militarily in any hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan.",
      "Beijing insists Taiwan \u2014 which Japan occupied for decades until its 1945 defeat in World War II \u2014   is part of its territory, and the prime minister's comments have sparked outrage among Chinese officials.",
      "Japanese leader's controversial remarks about China and Taiwan",
      "Before taking power last month, Prime Minister Senae Takaichi, 64, was a vocal critic of China and its military build-up in the Asia-Pacific.",
      "If a Taiwan emergency entails \"battleships and the use of force, then that could constitute a situation threatening the survival (of Japan),\" she told parliament on Nov. 7. Under Japan's self-imposed domestic rules, an existential threat is one of the few cases where it can act militarily. Taiwan sits around 60 miles from the nearest Japanese island.",
      "In response to Takaichi's remarks, a Chinese diplomat stationed in Japan threatened to \"cut off that dirty neck,\" apparently referring to Takaichi, as China and Japan summoned each other's ambassadors.",
      "In Beijing, tech worker Daniel Feng called the Chinese government's responses \"very restrained\" given Takaichi's \"extremely unreasonable\" remarks.",
      "\"If she spouts words, that's not a problem ... but if they take real action, our country's military will definitely defeat them,\" the 40-year-old told AFP.",
      "Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te called on Beijing on Monday to \"show restraint, act like a major power, and not become the troublemaker\" in the Asia-Pacific region, where peace and stability have been \"severely impacted.\"",
      "\"China should return to the path of a rules-based international order, which would help maintain peace, stability and prosperity in the region,\" Lai told reporters.",
      "Beijing, meanwhile, said Chinese premier Li Qiang had no plans to meet with Takaichi at the G20 summit in South Africa later this week, which they are both set to attend.",
      "Economic impact as Asian economic giants feud",
      "Beijing also advised its citizens over the weekend to avoid traveling to Japan, and warned the roughly 100,000 Chinese students in the country that there were alleged risks to their safety.",
      "Cabinet chief Kihara told reporters on Monday that the announcements were \"incompatible with the broader direction agreed upon by the leaders of the two nations.\"",
      "Japanese tourism and retail shares dived on Monday after China urged its citizens to avoid the neighboring nation's tourist hotspots.",
      "Asia's two top economies are closely entwined, with China the biggest source of tourists \u2014   almost 7.5 million visitors in the first nine months of 2025 \u2014   coming to Japan.",
      "Drawn by a weak yen making shopping cheaper, they collectively splurged more than a billion dollars a month in the third quarter, accounting for almost 30% of all tourist spending.",
      "Japan was also the fourth-most popular destination for Chinese tourists last year, helping the land of Mount Fuji, sushi and geishas set new records for foreign arrivals. But in fears that this may now stop, investors wiped 9% off Japanese cosmetics firm Shiseido's market value on Monday.",
      "Department store group Mitsukoshi fell 11.3% and Pan Pacific, behind discount retail chain and tourist magnet Don Quijote, slid 5.3%.",
      "Japan Airlines, whose shares nosedived 3.4%, has not seen any major cancellations on flights to and from China, a spokesperson told AFP.",
      "CBS News foreign correspondent Anna Coren reports that, apart from tourism there are concerns in Japan that China could inflict more economic pain by weaponizing its dominance in the supply chains of rare earth and other critical minerals, both of which are vital to Japan's electronics and automotive industries.",
      "Even Japan's film industry has been affected. Two movies due for release in China have been suspended.",
      "No off-ramp in sight for China and Japan's feud",
      "In response to the fallout, Coren said Japan on Tuesday urged its citizens in China to take precautions, including avoiding crowds and watching for suspicious people. Last year, a Japanese schoolboy was fatally stabbed in southern China.",
      "The tit-for-tat warnings from both capitals have fueled concern about nationalism being whipped up, and Coren said there was no apparent off-ramp available to ease tension. Japan sent a senior diplomat to Beijing for talks on Tuesday, but there was no announcement of any significant progress to ease the bilateral standoff.",
      "During the daily briefing on Tuesday at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a spokesman demanded that Japan \"immediately retract its erroneous remarks, engage in profound self-reflection, change course, and provide the Chinese people with a clear explanation\" of Takaichi's comments.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:18:14 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Nov. 9 said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a\u00a0Truth Social post last week. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later\u00a0told Fox News that the rebates would likely be given to families making \"less than, say, $100,000.\"\u00a0 That threshold is still in discussion, he added.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "Speaking from the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said his administration plans on issuing dividends from tariffs \"probably in the middle of next year.\"\u00a0He said \"thousands of dollars\" would go to \"moderate income, middle income\" Americans, adding that his administration has taken in \"tremendous amounts of money\" from tariffs.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "Bessent on Nov. 9 told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending new tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:27:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age is changing next year, affecting when the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers can collect 100% of their benefits.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security's so-called \"full retirement age\" \u2014 the age when people can start collecting all of their earned benefits \u2014 is about to hit a new threshold, a change that will affect Americans born in 1960 or later.",
      "The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security is calculated using a worker's birth year, while their monthly benefits are based on the number of years they've worked and their income over that period. People may claim Social Security as early as age 62, but doing so permanently reduces their monthly benefit by about 30% compared with waiting until hitting their FRA.",
      "Starting in 2026, Social Security's full retirement age is set to make its final scheduled increase, marking the last step-up in age enacted under a\u00a01983 congressional reform\u00a0designed to shore up the program's finances. Before that overhaul, people could claim their FRA benefits at 65, but the law gradually pushed that age higher, culminating in the change that takes effect in 2026.",
      "Since 2021, the FRA has been rising by two months each year. It now stands at 66 years and 10 months for people born in 1959. Next year brings the final step in that schedule, when the FRA will reach 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later.",
      "With the FRA hitting 67, people born in 1960 won't qualify for their full benefits until 2027, rather than 2026. (You can check your own full-benefit age by entering your birthdate into this Social Security calculator.)",
      "The increase in the FRA will first impact the youngest baby boomers, or those born between 1960-1964, followed by Generation X, which spans 1965 to 1980. The change comes as many workers report feeling financially unprepared for retirement, with only about four in 10 Americans saying they're on track to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement,\u00a0according\u00a0to recent research from Vanguard.",
      "\"Raising the retirement age is an effective cut in lifetime benefits for younger baby boomers, members of Gen X and all the generations after,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the advocacy group National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, in an email to CBS News.",
      "While the increase in the full retirement age shouldn't come as a surprise given it was enacted 43 years ago, it doesn't guarantee older workers will be any more prepared financially for retirement, he added.",
      "\"Having time to plan, however, does not mean they have been able to put aside more for retirement, considering the stagnation of real wages and the rising cost of college tuition, home prices and other key living expenses,\" Richtman said.",
      "Retirement expectations versus reality",
      "There's also a longstanding gap between the age at which people expect to stop working and their real-world experiences, which can add to the financial strain of funding retirement. Many Americans believe they'll retire at age 65, but the median retirement age in the U.S. is in fact 62.",
      "Nearly six in 10 retirees say they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned, according to research published last year by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. An October survey from the same group found that most middle-class retirees \u2014 people with annual household incomes between $50,000 and $199,999 \u2014 stopped working earlier than they envisioned because of employment issues, such as losing their jobs, or poor health.",
      "That gap between expectations and reality may explain recent research that found 44% of Americans said they plan to claim Social Security before they\u00a0reach their full retirement age, which would result in lower monthly benefits.",
      "Some Americans also flle for Social Security before reaching their FRA out of a belief it makes more sense to bank more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower monthly amount.",
      "Transamerica also found that nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore the conventional financial advice of\u00a0waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, which locks in a 24% boost to a retiree's FRA payments.",
      "In the meantime, younger boomers and Gen Xers will have to hold off a little longer to claim their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"These younger cohorts will have to try their best to plan for retirement, knowing that they cannot collect full benefits until 67,\" Richtman added.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can save you money preparing that Thanksgiving Day feast.",
      "Just tell an AI chatbot such as ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft Co-Pilot how many guests you're expecting, provide information on any dietary restrictions and outline your budget. The tools will help compare prices at different stores, and can even offer step-by-step instructions on how to prepare a Thanksgiving meal, as well as outline different recipes for various dishes.",
      "For example, Microsoft Co-Pilot lets users take photos of specific products and then ask questions about the product, like \"where can I find the best deal on this boxed stuffing?\" or \"how many boxes of this stuffing will I need to feed 10 people?\" The chatbot will offer suggestions based on those prompts, help shoppers buy the appropriate amount of ingredients and stay on budget by pointing to any cheaper options at local stores.",
      "Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst who goes by \"The SupermarketGuru,\" said smart shoppers can feed guests this holiday season for under $6 a person.",
      "AI is one tool consumers can use to ensure they're getting the best deals and to keep their holiday budgets under control. This year, shoppers can expect to spend roughly $80 to $95 \u2014 or $8 to $9.50 per person \u2014 preparing Thanksgiving dinner, according to a recent Wells Fargo analysis.",
      "That's about 2% to 3% less this year compared with Turkey Day costs in 2024, the bank found. Consumers are catching a break on foods such as bread, butter, eggs and wine, while the cost of staples such as potatoes, milk and some vegetables has remained flat or risen only modestly, according to the CBS News price tracker.",
      "As for the star ingredient, turkey, wholesale prices have jumped about 40% since last year, from 94 cents a pound to $1.32, according to the Department of Agriculture. However, wholesale costs don't always mean higher store prices. Wells Fargo found that retail prices for turkey are down 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Retailers are also making it easier for shoppers to save money and time by offering budget-friendly Thanksgiving dinner packages. Target offers a dinner option that serves four people for $20, while Amazon provides a similar package that feeds five for $25. Each bundle includes a turkey, along with ingredients for classic sides such as stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy and bread.",
      "For larger gatherings, Walmart and ALDI also have $40 meal baskets designed to serve up to 10 people.",
      "Tech can also help consumers find the best deals at supermarkets in their area. The Flipp app compiles digital ads from more than a thousand retailers and lets users browse weekly flyers, compare prices across stores and create shopping lists.",

    "summary": "The percentage of Americans just scraping by financially is rising as wage growth slows and inflation flares, Bank of America finds.",
    "story": [
      "A growing share of lower-income Americans are struggling to get by financially as their wages fail to keep up with inflation, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Roughly 29% of lower-income households are living paycheck to paycheck, up slightly from 2024 and from 27.1% in 2023, data from the Bank of America Institute shows. The financial firm defines that as spending more than 95% of household income on necessities such as housing, gasoline, groceries, utility bills and internet service.",
      "In 2025, nearly a quarter of all U.S. households lived paycheck to paycheck, Bank of America estimates. Several factors explain why many people are falling behind.",
      "First, the nation's inflation rate this year has edged up to an annual rate of 3%\u00a0after dipping to 2.3% in April. The rise in consumer prices this year is well below their pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in 2022, but remains above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%.",
      "\"Inflation is picking back up again, and cost increases are picking back up again,\" said Joe Wadford, an economist at the Bank of America Institute, which recently\u00a0examined\u00a0the financial pressures facing Americans by income. \"That's definitely going to put some renewed pressure on those households.\"",
      "Second, the cost of groceries and other essentials is continuing to rise as lower-wage workers see their paychecks and purchasing power stagnate. In October, wages for lower-income households were up only 1% from a year ago, according to Bank of America deposit data.",
      "\"The gap between their wages and expenses has just continued to widen since the beginning of the year,\" Wadford said. \"When the cost of living is increasing 3% but your wages are only increasing 1%, you're just going to really struggle to keep up.\"",
      "Lower-wage workers experienced strong wage growth during the pandemic and subsequent economic recovery, but that rise has slowed sharply since late 2022, according to Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. One factor weighing on wage growth \u2014 a decline in job openings and the rate at which workers are leaving their jobs.",
      "\"When people aren't looking for other offers or quitting, that is going to cause wage growth to slow,\" she said.",
      "In the trailing 12 months through October, higher-income millennial households have seen their average wages grow five percentage points faster than those of lower-income millennials, according to the Bank of America Institute.",
      "While lower-income households are struggling to scrape by, middle- and higher-income households are on firmer financial footing, buoyed by stronger wage growth. This group has seen little to no increase in the share of households living paycheck to paycheck, the Bank of America Institute found.",
      "\"These higher-income cohorts are more able to absorb the recent reacceleration in inflation due to their outsized wage growth,\" Wadford wrote in the report.",
      "That bifurcation is fueling what economists refer to as the \"K-shaped economy,\" a term experts use to describe the divergence in spending and financial health between wealthier Americans and people with more modest incomes.",
      "Gould also noted that many low-income Americans are unbanked and that Bank of America's findings, which are drawn from an analysis of its depositor data, may not fully capture the impact of slowing wage growth on poor households.",
      "\"You're missing some of the bottom end and how much pain [and] economic distress they may be feeling,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Wendy's plans to close hundreds of U.S. restaurants in the coming months as revenue and profits decline, with the company citing cutbacks by lower-income consumers that it expects will persist through year's end.",
      "On a Friday investor call, Ken Cook, Wendy's interim CEO, didn't disclose the exact number or locations of restaurants that it plans to shutter. But he said the Dublin, Ohio-based company is likely to close in the \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its 6,011 U.S locations, or roughly 300 store closures if it shuts 5% of its existing restaurants.",
      "Wendy's said the closures will start in the fourth quarter this year. Closing underperforming locations will improve traffic and profitability at its remaining U.S. restaurants, Cook added.",
      "Fast-food chains have been struggling to lift sales as lower-income consumers feel increasingly squeezed by rising food costs. Both Wendy's and McDonald's have introduced value meals to entice diners, but Cook said he doesn't expect the financial strain on these households to ease soon.",
      "\"We do see more pressure on the lower-income consumer,\" he said Friday. \"We continued to see that in [the third quarter] and we expect that to continue into the fourth.\"",
      "The new round of closures comes on top of the closure of 140 U.S. Wendy's locations in 2024. At the time, Wendy's said that many of the 55-year-old chain's restaurants are simply out of date.",
      "Cook became Wendy's CEO in July after the company's previous CEO, Kirk Tanner, left to become the president and CEO of Hershey Co.",
      "Cook said in some cases, Wendy's will make improvements to struggling stores, including adding technology or equipment. In other cases, it will transfer ownership to a different operator or close the restaurant altogether.",
      "\"When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective. The goal is to address and fix those restaurants,\" Cook said during a conference call with investors.",
      "In the first nine months of this year, Wendy's said its U.S. same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 4% compared to the same period last year. Wendy's revenue fell 2% to $1.63 billion in the same period, while its net income fell 6% to $138.6 million.",
      "Cook said $5 and $8 meal deals \u2014 which have been matched by McDonald's \u2014 have helped bring some traffic back to its U.S. stores. But Wendy's isn't doing a good job of bringing in new customers, Cook said, so the company plans to shift its marketing to emphasize its value and the freshness of its ingredients.",

That would represent a new record for Turkey Day travel, which has rebounded since dipping to 56.8 million travelers in 2020, when the pandemic caused people to cancel their plans.",

Flight cancellations have dropped since the end of the shutdown, which had prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to throttle air traffic at dozens of busy airports due to a shortage of air traffic controllers.",

      "Airlines were given permission to resume their regular flight schedules beginning Monday at 6 a.m. EST, the agency said.",
      "The announcement was made in a joint statement by Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford.",
      "Citing safety concerns as staffing shortages grew at air traffic control facilities during the shutdown, the FAA issued an unprecedented order to limit traffic in the skies. It had been in place since Nov. 7, affecting thousands of flights across the country.",
      "Impacted airports included large hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta.",
      "The flight cuts started at 4% and later grew to 6% before the FAA on Friday rolled the restrictions back to 3%, citing continued improvements in air traffic controller staffing since the record 43-day shutdown ended on Nov. 12.",
      "The number of flights canceled this weekend was at its lowest point since the order took effect and was well below the 3% cuts FAA was requiring for Saturday and Sunday. Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium showed that less than 1% of all flights were canceled this weekend. The flight tracking website FlightAware said 149 flights were cut Sunday and 315 were canceled on Saturday.",
      "The FAA statement said an agency safety team recommended the order be rescinded after \"detailed reviews of safety trends and the steady decline of staffing-trigger events in air traffic control facilities.\"",
      "The statement said the FAA \"is aware of reports of non-compliance by carriers over the course of the emergency order. The agency is reviewing and assessing enforcement options.\" It did not elaborate.",
      "Cancellations hit their highest point Nov. 9, when airlines cut more than 2,900 flights because of the FAA order, ongoing controller shortages and severe weather in parts of the country. Conditions began to improve throughout last week as more controllers returned to work amid news that Congress was close to a deal to end the shutdown. That progress also prompted the FAA to pause plans for further rate increases.",
      "The agency had initially aimed for a 10% reduction in flights. Duffy had said worrisome safety data showed the move was necessary to ease pressure on the aviation system and help manage worsening staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities as the shutdown entered its second month and flight disruptions began to pile up.",
      "Air traffic controllers were among the federal employees who had to continue working without pay throughout the shutdown. They missed two paychecks during the impasse.",
      "Duffy hasn't shared the specific safety data that prompted the cuts, but he cited reports during the shutdown of planes getting too close in the air, more runway incursions and pilot concerns about controllers' responses.",
      "Airline leaders have expressed optimism that operations would rebound in time for the Thanksgiving travel period after the FAA lifted its order.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Nov 2025 09:15:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Prediction markets, like Kalshi, which allow people to place wagers on everything from elections and sports to the anticipated bridesmaids at Taylor Swift's wedding, are booming. But this burgeoning business model is coming under scrutiny.",
    "story": [
      "Joel Holsinger just quit his day job to bet on the words that famous people, like White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, might say in public. \"I thought there was a very high likelihood she would bring up 'Thanksgiving' in relation to the shutdown,\" he said.",
      "From his computer, the 26-year-old makes about $3,000 a week trading on the prediction market Kalshi.",
      "\"She did not say Thanksgiving, so we were out $700 yesterday,\" Holsinger said.",
      "That hurts, right? \"Surprisingly for me, doesn't hurt really much,\" Holsinger replied. \"I have had times where I've lost, for example, like, $6,000 on a bad trade, but also the inverse of that; I've made $11,000 on a trade, and so, you know, it's just ups-and-downs.\"",
      "The live streaming influencer is one of millions of people flocking to prediction markets like Kalshi, PredictIt and Polymarket where you can wager on just about anything.",
      "Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara are former Wall Street traders-turned-co-founders of Kalshi. \"A prediction market is like the stock market, but instead of buying and selling companies, you're buying 'yes' and 'no' on whether something is going to happen or not,\" Mansour said. \"So, it could be whether Mamdani was going to win the last New York mayor's race, or there's going to be a hurricane in Florida next month.\"",
      "Lopes Lara said, \"People can make money on what they know, actually monetize their knowledge, monetize their hobby, because everyone is an expert on something.\"",
      "Kalshi made a name for itself in the 2024 election. The presidential race looked close, unless you were keeping an eye on Kalshi, which called the race well before the TV networks did. \"It was like Kalshi, then Fox, then CNN,\" said Mansour. \"It was crazy.\"",
      "Twelve months later, Kalshi was the talk of another election: The New York City mayor's race. As Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani told the crowd on Oct. 26, \"You see the Kalshi odds that have our chances of victory in the 90s.\"",
      "Kalshi's numbers are not polling data; they represent what people think is going to happen. \"It's people putting money on what they think is going to happen, and then the wisdom of the crowds in the markets come up with the probabilities of who is going to win,\" said Lopes Lara.",
      "And you can bet on (or Kalshi says \"invest in\") more than 3,500 markets on the company's platform, like who will be a bridesmaid in Taylor Swift's wedding.",
      "I asked, \"How do I know that someone close to Taylor Swift, or Taylor Swift herself, isn't participating in a way that will make her outcome more favorable and let her, you know, take home a little extra cash?\"",
      "Lopes Lara replied, \"Kalshi is a federally-regulated, fully-compliant exchange, and we have systems in place to monitor for any suspicious or unusual activity. We also have a lot of trading prohibitions in place.\"",
      "According to Mansour, \"There really hasn't been any issues.\"",
      "Prediction markets are booming. The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is investing $2 billion in Polymarket, and the sports betting platform FanDuel will launch its own prediction market next month.",
      "In fact, when it's not an election, the majority of the money traded on Kalshi is not on politics or culture \u2013 it's on sports. Jonathan Cohen, author of \"Losing Big,\" has chronicled the rise of sports betting in the U.S. Regarding Kalshi, he said, \"You can bet on things that a traditional Sportsbook would offer you.\"",
      "\"Kalshi says this is an investment. You don't buy that?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Cohen. \"The New England Patriots are not more likely to win their game because I bought a contract for them to win the game. It is a speculative instrument purely for my own use and my own entertainment, which to me qualifies it as gambling rather than investing.\"",
      "But Kalshi is not regulated like gambling. Online sports betting is only legal in 31 states; Kalshi is available in all 50. \u00a0The Biden administration tried to prevent Kalshi from offering sports markets. Then, when President Trump returned to the White House, his administration vowed to break with \"past hostility\" \u2013 and earlier this year, the president's son, Donald Jr, became a strategic advisor to both Kalshi and its main rival, Polymarket.",
      "Asked why Kalshi made Donald Trump Jr. a strategic advisor, Mansour replied, \"We have a lot of advisors, um, and they span across the board, across different functions. But really, this is all about growing this industry, the prediction market industry, that a lot of people really believe in.\"",
      "I asked, \"What kind of advice does he give you?\"",
      "\"So, it really is, again, about growing prediction markets,\" Mansour said. \"You know, he believes in prediction markets. We believe in prediction markets. A lot of people believe in prediction markets, and it's really about go-to-market and expansion plans.\"",
      "\"Does he come to meetings? How much do you pay him? What's his role? I mean, this is the son of the president.\"",
      "\"We, again, I mean, we have a lot of advisors,\" Mansour replied. \"And whether it's our investors, whether it's, uh, people that we really trust and respect, whether \u2013 \"",
      "\"But he's not just any advisor; he has a direct line to the White House,\" I said.",
      "\"We have a lot of advisors,\" said Mansour.",
      "Kalshi is embroiled in legal battles with several states, like Massachusetts, that say Kalshi's sports markets amount to \"unlawful sports wagering.\"",
      "Are the states wrong? \"We are confident in what we're doing,\" said Mansour. \"We're confident in our position from the law, and we're also confident in the fact that, you know, customers are actually finding a lot of value in basically what we're offering. So, I would say yes.\"",
      "But for now, if you are over the age of 18, you can bet on just about anything, anywhere, any time.",
      "Cohen said, \"It's not enough to, like, like Taylor Swift anymore. You have to use your knowledge of Taylor Swift to, like, try to make money off of how many streams she's going to get in a month. Or it's not enough to, I don't know, even like politics anymore; you have to gamble on politics. You have to make money on politics.",
      "\"That, to me, it seems like sort of the canary in the coal mine of like a 'gamblification' of American culture that I think is sort of still on the rise,\" he said, \"and we might not like what that looks like when it fully arrives.\"",

    "summary": "Disney and YouTube TV reached a new deal to bring channels like ABC and ESPN back to the Google-owned live streaming platform Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Disney and YouTube TV reached a new deal to bring channels like ABC and ESPN back to the Google-owned live streaming platform Friday, ending a blackout for customers that dragged on for about two weeks.",
      "\"As part of the new deal, Disney's full suite of networks and stations \u2013 including ESPN and ABC \u2013 have already begun to be restored to YouTube TV subscribers,\" The Walt Disney Co. said in a statement. \"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football.\"",
      "Disney content had gone dark on YouTube TV the night of Oct. 30, after the two sides failed to reach a new licensing deal. In the days that followed, YouTube TV subscribers were left without Disney channels on the platform \u2014 notably disrupting coverage of top U.S. college football matchups and professional sports games, among other news and entertainment offerings.",
      "Beyond ESPN and ABC, other Disney-owned content removed from YouTube TV during the impasse included channels like NatGeo, FX, Freeform, SEC Network, ACC Network and more.",
      "At the time the carriage dispute reached its boiling point, YouTube TV said that Disney was proposing terms that would be too costly, resulting in higher prices and fewer choices for its subscribers. And the platform accused Disney of using the blackout \"as a negotiating tactic\" \u2014 claiming that the move also benefited Disney's own streaming products like Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.",
      "Disney, meanwhile, said that YouTube TV had refused to pay fair rates for its channels. The California entertainment giant also accused Google of \"using its market dominance to eliminate competition.\" And executives blasted the platform for pulling content \"prior to the midnight expiration\" of their deal last month.",
      "On Nov. 3, Disney also asked YouTube TV to restore ABC programming for Election Day on Nov. 4 to put \"the public interest first.\" But YouTube TV said this temporary reprieve would confuse customers \u2014 and instead proposed that the entertainment giant agree to restore both its ABC and ESPN channels while the two sides continued negotiations.",
      "The blackout marked the latest in a growing list of licensing disputes in today's streaming world. And consumers often pay the price.",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years, as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But amid growing competition, renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations \u2014 and at times service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV and Disney have been down this road before. In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers also briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform after a similar contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",
      "Meanwhile, YouTube TV has removed other networks from its platform after expired agreements. Spanish-language broadcaster Univision has been unavailable on YouTube TV since Sept. 30, for example. At the time, its parent company TelevisaUnivision decried Google's move \u2014 noting it would strip \"millions of Hispanic viewers of the Spanish-language news, sports, and entertainment they rely on every day\" and called on the platform to reverse course.",
      "YouTube TV's base subscription plan costs $82.99 per month \u2014 which, beyond Disney content, currently includes live TV offerings from networks like NBC, CBS, Fox, PBS and more. The platform previously said it would give subscribers a $20 credit if its dispute with Disney lasted \"an extended period of time\" \u2014 which it reportedly allowed customers to start claiming on Nov. 9.",
      "Disney also doles out live TV through both traditional broadcasting and its own lineup of streaming platforms. ESPN launched its own streamer earlier this year, starting at $29.99 a month. And other Disney content can be found on platforms like Hulu, Disney+ and Fubo. Disney currently allows people to bundle ESPN along with Hulu and Disney+ for $35.99 a month \u2014 or $29.99 a month for the first year.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump exempted foods like beef, coffee and bananas from his sweeping country-by-country tariffs on Friday, as his administration grapples with cost-of-living frustrations and\u00a0quickly rising prices for some types of food.",
      "The new exemption covers a range of tropical products that are often imported to the United States, including coffee, tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados, coconuts, pineapples, cocoa and spices such as nutmeg, according to an executive order. It also covers beef, oranges and tomatoes.",
      "The White House said Mr. Trump decided to exempt the products on Friday because he's made \"substantial progress\" in negotiating trade deals with other countries. A day earlier, Mr. Trump announced trade frameworks with four Latin American countries \u2014 Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador \u2014 that included relief for food that isn't widely produced in the U.S.",
      "The food products will no longer be covered by the \"reciprocal\" tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on most U.S. trading partners, which range from 10% to 40% or more. Some types of food could still be impacted by other forms of tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Friday the tariff exemptions should cause prices to go down, and they mostly applied to food that is \"not competitive in this country,\" like bananas.",
      "\"We don't make them in this country, so there's no protection of our industries or our food products,\" he said aboard Air Force One.",
      "The moves come as polls show that voters remain nervous about inflation and wary of Mr. Trump's approach to the issue, which helped propel him back to the White House last year.",
      "Food prices rose 3.1% in the yearlong period ending in September, well below its peak of 11.4% in 2022, according to federal data. But certain types of food have surged: Beef prices were up 12.9% year-over-year in September, banana prices were up 6.9% and roasted coffee 18.9%.",
      "Mr. Trump has insisted\u00a0costs are actually down since he took over from former President Joe Biden, and has long denied that higher tariffs could push up consumer prices \u2014 a persistent fear raised by economists.",
      "But rising beef prices have alarmed Mr. Trump, who accused foreign-owned meat packing companies earlier this month of \"driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.\"",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump said he's considering importing more beef from Argentina to help get prices down. It's a delicate issue, though, because boosting beef imports could upset U.S.-based ranchers, who are typically supportive of the president. Trade groups like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association publicly criticized the idea.",
      "Mr. Trump responded on Truth Social that ranchers \"have to get their prices down.\"",
      "\"The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don't understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States,\" he wrote. \"If it weren't for me, they would be doing just as they've done for the past 20 years \u2014 Terrible!\"",

      "The Trump administration is\u00a0scrapping a proposed Biden-era rule\u00a0that would have made airlines pay customers for long waits when their flights were delayed, according to a document from the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "The Transportation Department on Friday\u00a0published a notice that it is officially withdrawing the proposed rule, introduced in 2024 under President Biden and then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The regulation would have required airlines to pay passengers $200 to $300 for domestic delays lasting at least three hours, and up to $775 for flight delays lasting at least nine hours.",
      "The agency, which announced in September that it planned to abandon the proposal, said the notice will be published in the Federal Register on Monday. The passenger protection measure would have created \"unnecessary regulatory burdens,\" the Transportation Department said Friday.",
      "In October, a group of Democratic senators defended the regulation in a letter to the Trump administration, calling it a \"common-sense proposal\" that would have held airlines accountable for their mistakes. They noted that delays can place a financial strain on families when they are forced to rebook flights or secure overnight accommodations.",
      "Customers in the U.S. are entitled to refunds for canceled flights, but no similar protections are in place for delays.",
      "The agency on Friday explained its rationale for ditching the measure, saying the move would \"allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines.\"",
      "When reached for comment Friday, the Transportation Department told CBS News that the \"Biden-Buttigieg proposal was just that \u2014 a proposal.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, the chairman of the Senate health committee, says \"we're absolutely in communication with the White House\" about a plan to bring down the cost of health care for Americans.",
      "He told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" in an interview airing Sunday he's aiming to have a proposal ready for a vote that is set to take place in mid-December.",
      "Tax credits for about 22 million Americans who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace were at the center of the government shutdown that ended Wednesday. A Biden-era expansion of those subsidies is expiring at the end of the year, so unless they're extended, many consumers will likely face far higher insurance premiums.",
      "Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but they eventually settled for the promise of a vote next month on extending the enhanced tax credits.",
      "Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said of any plan to extend the subsidies, \"Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies.\"",
      "Instead, he's asking Republican and Democratic colleagues to collaborate on lowering health insurance premiums and directly giving Americans money to help them offset high deductibles that are often a feature of the lower-cost policies under the ACA.",
      "\"We can do it better with lower premiums and with money and accounts to pay deductibles,\" Cassidy told Brennan. He said he's telling Democrats, \"Let's not be Democrats and Republicans \u2014 let's be Americans, representing all of Americans.\"",
      "President Trump offered a similar idea last weekend, writing on Truth Social the money that's spent on health insurance subsidies should be \"SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE.\"",
      "Brennan pressed Cassidy on extending the expanded tax credits, which were created in 2021 and are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Noting the approximately 293,000 Louisianans currently enrolled in Obamacare, Brennan asked, \"Are you telling those hundreds of thousands of Louisianans that that tax credit is going away no matter what, that they should make plans no for higher prices?\"",
      "Cassidy countered that the problem with the plans was that many of them have high deductibles, with some reaching $6,000 in out-of-pocket costs. The lower-premium \"bronze\" plans on the ACA's marketplaces often have high deductibles.",
      "\"Margaret, I'm a doctor,\" Cassidy said. \"I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, 'I can't afford that. My deductible is too high.' That's reality, and that reality is being lost in this discussion.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:31:18 -0500",
    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance as investors worry the AI boom could go bust.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Thursday's stock market tumble \u2014 when high-flying AI stocks such as Nvidia and CoreWeave led the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to see its biggest drop in months \u2014 fueled further anxiety this week about another bubble.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",
      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

    "summary": "Some businesses say steeper U.S. tariffs this year give them less financial room to offer holiday savings.",
    "story": [
      "Businesses face a tough decision this holiday season: Run a Black Friday promotion and see their profits drop, or charge full price and risk turning off buyers.",
      "Some business owners said sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports are raising their costs, giving them less room to roll out aggressive holiday sales.",
      "Lisa Cheng Smith, founder of Yun Hai Taiwanese Pantry, a New York City-based retailer that imports products from businesses and farms in Taiwan, said her costs have jumped 20% to 50% this year from 2024 because of U.S. tariffs on imports from Taiwan and other Asian countries.",
      "In past years, Yun Hai has offered a 15% Black Friday discount as a way to drive holiday purchases, with Cheng Smith telling CBS News that the annual promotion \"is a really important thing for us.\" This year, however, she's unsure how much of a discount she can afford to offer, given her higher operational costs resulting from tariffs.",
      "\"It's complicated because of tariffs and how the retail math works,\" Cheng Smith said. \"Do we offer less of a discount and try to preserve margins, or do we use the same promotion language and structures that customers have come to expect?\"",
      "For small business owners, such calculations can make all the difference, she added. \"What we do from October through December is equal to the whole rest of the year in terms of sales, so every day is more high stakes,\" she noted.",
      "Retail experts said higher tariff costs for retailers and other businesses could mean fewer, and paltrier, Black Friday discounts this year.",
      "\"There will be discounts and deals \u2014 that's what Black Friday is about. Very few retailers will want to shun that completely, but I think they will be more surgical and selective in the discounting,\" Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"They will perhaps discount fewer items, and some discounts will be less generous in terms of the amount of money off.\"",
      "Dan Peskorse, whose company, Upstream Brands, sells a range of merchandise under different labels on Amazon and other e-commerce sites, also said higher tariff costs are forcing him to rethink his Black Friday strategy this year.",
      "For previous Black Fridays, Peskorse said Upstream Brands typically offered discounts of up to 30% on products sold under the company's flagship brands, including ThinkFit, which makes meal-prep bags and containers, and Ash Harbor, a maker of small home goods.",
      "Not this year. \"This is the first year that we are not offering across-the-board discounts on products,\" he said, noting that the decision was \"100%\" related to tariffs.",
      "Peskorse has taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including raising prices and absorbing the extra costs that come with importing goods from China and India. The only tool he has left to control costs and preserve his business's profits is to scrap discounts, he said.",
      "The average U.S. tariff rate has increased sevenfold this year, to 16.6%, according to EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. Those higher duties are pushing up the prices of imported goods as retailers pass on a portion of the\u00a0costs to shoppers, he noted.",
      "\"It's going to be a strange season\"",
      "Squeezed by tariff costs, many businesses are also grappling with a slowdown in holiday spending by lower-income consumers still feeling the\u00a0impact of persistent inflation.",
      "\"I think the rubber is going to hit the road when we get into Black Friday,\" said Sonia Lapinsky, a retail analyst at management consulting firm AlixPartners. \"Consumers are telling us they are pulling back on holiday spending this year, holding on to their dollars and putting their money in critical places, not in discretionary buckets.\"",
      "Discounts are a powerful tool for incentivizing consumers to spend money, she added.",
      "\"It's the only way retailers will get them in the door, because they can't stomach this,\" Lapinsky said. \"So it's going to be a strange season. If retailers get it wrong, they're risking the biggest selling season they have.\"",

    "summary": "State-sponsored cybercriminals used Anthropic's tech to target tech companies, financial institutions and other organizations, AI company alleges.",
    "story": [
      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company shared its findings with CBS News but did not offer additional comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",
      "Chris Krebs, the former head of the federal government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS Mornings on Friday that this attack is a sign of what's to come.",
      "\"As security experts, we've been talking about events and attacks like this for close to a decade,\" he said. To see an AI cyberattack come to life like this is \"pretty chilling,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Walmart said Doug McMillon will be replaced on Feb. 1, 2026, by John Furner, head of Walmart's U.S. operations.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart on Friday said CEO Doug McMillon, who started his career with the retailer as an hourly worker and who has led the company since 2014, will retire in January.",
      "McMillon, 59, will step down as CEO on Jan. 31 but remain on the retailer's board of directors until its annual shareholders' meeting. John Furner, who has served as president and CEO of Walmart U.S. since 2019, will take over as chief executive on Feb. 1.",
      "McMillon oversaw an expansion of tech-based initiatives at Walmart, such as investing in e-commerce and artificial intelligence, while also increasing wages and benefits for Walmart's 2.1 million workers. Under his tenure, Walmart's shares surged more than 300%, buoyed by rising sales and profitability.",
      "\"McMillon is very highly regarded by investors and helped the company navigate a volatile retail landscape over the last ~12 years as CEO,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a research note, adding that his retirement is \"somewhat surprising.\"",
      "Since McMillon became CEO in February 2014, Walmart's annual revenue has grown from nearly $486 billion to $681 billion in its latest fiscal year.",
      "\"People thought he would stay on longer given how well the company is performing and his relatively young age,\" Crisafulli noted.",
      "McMillon had told the Wall Street Journal in March 2023 that he pledged to remain in his role for another three years as the company searched for a successor. McMillon has spent his entire career at Walmart, starting in 1984 as an associate who picked orders and unloaded trailers in a warehouse, according to his company bio.",
      "Furner, 51, has proved to be a \"strong leader\" as he managed Walmart's U.S. business, said GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders in a research note. But, he added, McMillon's retirement \"will send a small shockwave through Walmart, simply because he has been an excellent leader and steward of the company, he said.",
      "In a statement, McMillon said he's worked with Furner for more than 20 years. \"His love for our associates and this company runs deep. His curiosity and digital acumen combined with a deep commitment to our people and culture will enable him to take us to the next level,\" McMillon said in the statement.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "An extension of enhanced ACA tax credits appears unlikely, experts say, leaving millions of Americans facing potentially higher health plan costs in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The cost of health care remains in limbo for roughly 22 million Americans after the U.S. government reopened late Wednesday without a deal to extend an expiring federal tax credit that offsets the cost of some Affordable Care Act plans.",
      "The fate of the enhanced premium tax credit had been at the center of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history as Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidy in order to reopen the government.",
      "The Senate\u00a0voted late Sunday\u00a0on a deal to end the shutdown that did not resolve the future of the tax credit \u2014 a central demand of Democrats during the government funding fight. On Wednesday, the House approved the Senate-passed funding package to end the 43-day shutdown. President Trump signed the legislation shortly after.",
      "To secure the Democratic votes needed to reopen the government, Senate Republicans\u00a0agreed to hold a separate vote\u00a0on extending the ACA tax credits by mid-December. But a vote isn't guaranteed to succeed, and even if the legislation makes it out of the Senate, House GOP leaders have not committed to holding a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "Americans are now choosing their 2026 health plans on the ACA's online marketplaces, and without congressional action, the tax credits will expire Dec. 31.",
      "\"A lot of people are sort of in this limbo state where they have to buy their insurance for next year, but they really don't know how this is going to shake out at the federal level,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at nonprofit health policy site KFF, told CBS News.",
      "What happens without an extension?",
      "The subsidies were introduced in 2021 through the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, and then extended for three more years in the Inflation Reduction Act. Without any action on Congress's part, the enhanced premium tax credits will disappear at the end of 2025.",
      "That means low- and middle-income households that previously qualified for the tax credits would likely see their ACA premiums more than double next year, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a KFF analysis.",
      "Faced with higher costs for ACA insurance, about 4 million people are likely to drop their health coverage, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "\"Americans are really just seeing how expensive health care is in this country, and it's just completely unaffordable for a lot of people to pay their own entire health insurance premium,\" Wager said.",
      "Currently, the enhanced ACA premium tax credit is available for people who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which sets the upper threshold at $62,000 for an individual, according to KFF. However, some Americans who earn above that 400% benchmark can qualify for the tax credit if their insurance rates exceed 8.5% of their income.",
      "Three-quarters of Americans favor renewing the subsidies, according to recent KFF polling. That includes 94% of Democrats and about half of Republicans.",
      "If Congress renews the subsidies, federal and state marketplaces would need to retool the 2026 plans already available to consumers. It's possible a new plan could be made retroactive to January 2026, even if it's passed later in the year, Wager said.",
      "\"At that point, people are sort of locked in on whatever plan they chose, but they can retroactively receive the tax credit,\" she noted.",
      "Are there other options from Congress?",
      "Congress could pursue other ways to make health coverage more affordable. On Saturday, President Trump called for sending the money saved by not extending the tax subsidies \"directly to the people.\" On his Truth Social platform, he criticized the ACA and said Americans should be able to use the savings to purchase other kinds of insurance.",
      "\"In other words, take from the BIG, BAD Insurance Companies, give it to the people, and terminate, per Dollar spent, the worst Healthcare anywhere in the World, ObamaCare,\" he wrote.",
      "Wager said it remains to be seen if Mr. Trump's plan is feasible, saying \"we haven't seen a concrete enough proposal at this point.\"",
      "Some lawmakers have offered similar proposals, such as Senate Health Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana. In a floor speech last week, he said eligible Americans could be sent \"a pre-funded federal flexible spending account\" to use for health expenses, from dental care to prescription drugs and preventive services.",
      "In the meantime, as 2026 approaches and the future of the enhanced premium tax credit remains unclear, enrollees should consider speaking with a health insurance expert to get advice on their options, Wager advised.",
      "\"The most important thing that you can do is talk to somebody \u2014 an agent, broker or a navigator \u2014 who can help you make sure that you really understand what your options are and that you get the best plan for your financial situation and your health care situation,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Federal immigration authorities will expand their enforcement action in North Carolina to Raleigh, the mayor said, while Customs and Border Protection agents continue operating in Charlotte.",
    "story": [
      "Federal immigration authorities will expand their enforcement action in North Carolina to Raleigh as soon as Tuesday, the mayor of the state's capital city said, while Customs and Border Protection agents continue operating in Charlotte following a weekend that saw arrests of more than 130 people in that city, the state's largest.",
      "Mayor Janet Cowell said Monday that she didn't know how large the operation would be or how long agents would be present.",
      "Immigration authorities haven't spoken about it. CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.",
      "Cowell, a Democrat, pointed out in a statement that crime was lower in Raleigh this year compared to last and that public safety was a priority for her and the city council.",
      "\"I ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges,\" she said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cowell added that, \"While RPD is not involved in immigration enforcement, we are committed to protecting our residents and to following the law. I can confirm that the Raleigh Police Department has not participated in any immigration planning activities.\"",
      "Democratic North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement on social media Monday night that his office \"is aware of reports that the Border Patrol is bringing its operation to Raleigh. Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations. Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte.",
      "\"To the people of Raleigh: remain peaceful, and if you see something wrong, record it and report it to local law enforcement. Let's keep each other safe.\"",
      "The Trump administration has made Charlotte, a Democratic city of about 950,000 people, its latest focus for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime - despite local opposition and declining crime rates. Residents reported encounters with immigration agents near churches, apartment complexes and stores.",
      "Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Border Patrol officers had arrested \"over 130 illegal aliens who have all broken\" immigration laws. The agency said the records of those arrested included gang membership, aggravated assault, shoplifting and other crimes, but it didn't spell out how many cases had resulted in convictions, how many people had been facing charges or any other details.",
      "Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools reported Monday that, \"Unofficial attendance data from today indicates that approximately 20,935 students were absent from school today. This accounts for approximately 15% of students enrolled\" in that district. There was no word on the percentage of students who are absent on a typical day there.",
      "The immigration crackdown set off fierce objections from leaders in the Charlotte area.",
      "\"We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color,\" Stein said in a video statement late Sunday. \"This is not making us safer. It's stoking fear and dividing our community.\"",
      "Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said Monday she was \"deeply concerned\" about videos she's seen of the crackdown but also said she appreciates protesters' peacefulness.",
      "\"To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: You are not alone. Your city stands with you,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Charlotte area's place in immigration issue",
      "Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County have both found themselves part of America's debates over crime and immigration, two of the most important issues to the White House.",
      "The most prominent was the fatal stabbing this summer of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train, an attack captured on video. While the suspect was from the U.S., the Trump administration repeatedly highlighted that he'd been arrested more than a dozen times.",
      "Charlotte, which had a Republican mayor as recently as 2009, is now a city dominated by Democrats, with a growing population brought by a booming economy. The racially diverse city includes more than 150,000 foreign-born residents, officials say.",
      "Lyles easily won a fifth term as mayor earlier this month, defeating her Republican rival by 45 percentage points even as GOP critics blasted city and state leaders for what they call rising incidents of crime. Following the Nov. 4 election, Democrats are poised to hold 10 of the other 11 seats on the city council.",
      "While the DHS has said it's focusing on the state because of sanctuary policies, North Carolina county jails have long honored \"detainers,\" or requests from federal officials to hold an arrested immigrant for a limited time so agents can take custody of them. Nevertheless, some common, noncooperation policies have existed in a handful of places, including Charlotte, where the police don't help with immigration enforcement.",
      "In Mecklenburg County, the jail didn't honor detainer requests for several years, until after state law effectively made it mandatory starting last year.",
      "DHS said about 1,400 detainers across North Carolina had not been honored since October 2020, putting the public at risk.",
      "For years, Mecklenburg Sheriff Garry McFadden pushed back against efforts by the Republican-controlled state legislature to force him and a handful of sheriffs from other urban counties to accept ICE detainers.",
      "Republicans ultimately overrode a veto by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper late last year to enact the bill into law.",
      "While McFadden has said his office is complying with the law's requirement, he continued a public feud with ICE leaders in early 2025 that led to a new state law toughening those rules. Stein vetoed that measure, but the veto was overridden.",
      "Republican House Speaker Destin Hall said in a Monday post on X that immigration agents are in Charlotte because of McFadden's past inaction: \"They're stepping in to clean up his mess and restore safety to the city.\"",
      "Last month, McFadden said he'd had a productive meeting with an ICE representative.",
      "\"I made it clear that I do not want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,\" McFadden said in a statement.",
      "But such talk doesn't calm the political waters.",
      "\"Democrats at all levels are choosing to protect criminal illegals over North Carolina citizens,\" state GOP Chairman Jason Simmons said Monday.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-welcomes-mbs-saudi-crown-prince-white-house/",
    "published": "Tue, 18 Nov 2025 06:00:09 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump hopes to seal major business and security deals with MBS during Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's White House visit.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has a warm and elaborate welcome planned for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, at the White House Tuesday, signaling his administration's close ties to the Saudi kingdom as the president aims to lock in major business and national security deals.",
      "Ahead of bin Salman's arrival, the president told reporters Monday that the U.S. would sell F-35 fighter jets to the Saudis.",
      "The White House has prepared an arrival ceremony laden with fanfare for the crown prince, complete with cannons and U.S. and Saudi flags draped on buildings. The U.S. military will conduct an aircraft flyover over the White House during MBS' arrival.",
      "There will also be a black-tie dinner with bin Salman. There are 120 invited guests, according to a person familiar with the planning, and 30 will be from the Saudi delegation. Although it's not a state dinner, it is the first formal dinner hosted by Mr. Trump in his second term to honor a nation's leader. Bin Salman's father, Salman bin Abdulaziz is technically the head of state of the kingdom, but he delegated his duties as ruler to MBS in 2017.",
      "\"We're more than meeting,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of the visit. \"We're honoring Saudi Arabia.\"",
      "A senior administration official said the president will be making announcements regarding Saudi investment in U.S. AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy, defense sales and the fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge, which was announced during the president's trip to Saudi Arabia in May.",
      "The White House visit is also expected to include an Oval Office meeting and lunch, similar to meetings the president has held with other world leaders in recent weeks.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly called the trip \"an official working visit\" in a statement and said, \"Americans can expect more good deals for our country spanning technology, manufacturing, critical minerals, defense, and more.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is also planning to attend a Saudi business summit in Washington, D.C., Wednesday. An invitation previously obtained by CBS News said the event at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts will be co-hosted by the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia and the U.S.-Saudi Business Council.",
      "Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and former top White House adviser Jared Kushner have fostered close relationships with the Saudis and the crown prince in particular, viewing them as critical partners for both security and business in a turbulent Middle East. The president said the Abraham Accords \u2014 an agreement from his first term that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel, Bahrain and the UAE\u00a0 \u2014 would be a big topic of discussion during the visit.",
      "\"The Abraham Accords will be a part we're going to be discussing,\" Mr. Trump said over the weekend. \"I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly. We've had tremendous interest in the Abraham Accords since we put Iran out of business.\"",
      "Mr. Trump recently told \"60 Minutes\" contributing correspondent Norah O'Donnell that he thought bin Salman would join the agreement, although the Saudis have indicated that would not happen without a path to Palestinian statehood.",
      "The Trumps also have extensive and longheld personal business ties in Saudi Arabia. Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea.",
      "Eric Trump, the president's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told Reuters that the Trump Organization also has plans for a Trump-branded property in Riyadh.",
      "And Kushner started a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received a reported $2 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund controlled by bin Salman.",
      "The trip to the White House visit is the crown prince's first U.S. visit since Washington Post journalist and human rights activist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in 2018 in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul by members of the Saudi government. The president has smoothed over relations with the Saudis since the CIA assessed about a month after Khashoggi's killing that the crown prince had ordered it. Bin Salman has denied anyinvolvement, but he told O'Donnell in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview that he took responsibility for Khashoggi's death.",
      "\"I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government,\" he told O'Donnell.",
      "The Biden administration later released the Trump-era intelligence report concluding the crown prince \"approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not seek to punish bin Salman personally during his first administration and said he viewed Saudi Arabia as a \"great ally,\" noting the economic ties between the U.S. and the Saudis. The Trump administration did sanction 19 Saudi nationals over the killing.",
      "\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Mr. Trump posted on social media in November 2018.",
      "\"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\"",
      "Human rights advocates are dismayed about the treatment bin Salman is expected to receive in Washington, not only because of Khashoggi's murder, but also because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record under bin Salman.",
      "\"We know President Trump won't ask MBS to reveal where Jamal's remains are so his family can finally bury him,\" said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now, an organization Khashoggi founded months before he was killed. \"But the least he can do \u2014 the absolute minimum \u2014 is publicly press MBS to release the dozens of activists, writers and reformers languishing in Saudi prisons for the 'crime' of speaking freely.\"",
      "Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director at DAWN, called bin Salman's journey from castigation over Khashoggi's murder to a high-profile White House welcome an \"extraordinary political feat.\" And that's not just because of Mr. Trump's gestures of friendship toward the crown prince. Whitson mentioned the \"fist bump seen around the world,\" as former President Joe Biden warmly greeted Khashoggi in Riyadh during his presidency \"hat in hand.\"",
      "\"We went from the Biden administration narrowly sanctioning Mohamamd bin Salman himself for the murder of Khashoggi \u2026 to now welcoming him into Washington and not only sort of feting him for whatever lucrative deals he can pass to American businesses, but also to potentially actually help as a stabilizing force,\" Whitson said.",

    "summary": "The measure compelling the Justice Department to release materials related to Jeffrey Epstein is expected to pass the House. In a sudden reversal, President Trump told lawmakers they should vote for it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House is expected to finally vote Tuesday on a bill that would compel the Justice Department to release materials related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after GOP leaders dragged out the process for months.",
      "The issue has disrupted committee meetings, stalled floor action on other legislation since this summer and fueled President Trump's tirades against some House Republicans, most recently GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. House Speaker Mike Johnson expedited a vote on the issue after more than half of all House members \u2014 including every Democrat and four Republicans \u2014 signed a petition forcing a vote.",
      "Mr. Trump suddenly reversed his opposition to the bill late Sunday after it appeared all but certain there would be mass Republican defections.",
      "But House passage isn't enough on its own. Here's what to know about the process, what comes next, and how we got here.",
      "What the House's Epstein bill would do",
      "The bill would require the attorney general to make public all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices within 30 days of becoming law.",
      "Information that falls under that umbrella includes investigative and prosecutorial materials related to Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as flight logs, travel records and materials about Epstein's detention and death. It also calls for the release of names of individuals and entities referenced in any Epstein case and internal Justice Department communications about the case.",
      "It would also make public any records \"concerning the destruction, deletion, alteration, misplacement, or concealment of documents, recordings, or electronic data\" related to Epstein and his associates.",
      "What files does the DOJ have on Epstein?",
      "It's not clear what \u2014 or how many \u2014 records the Justice Department has in its possession, but Epstein and Maxwell have been the subject of multiple federal investigations.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal and state officials in Florida in the 2000s, which ended with him pleading guilty to state-level prosecution charges. He was investigated again more than a decade later, leading to federal charges in 2019 for allegedly sex trafficking minors.",
      "Maxwell was charged in 2020, and she is now serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
      "And Epstein's 2019 death by suicide in federal custody was probed by the Justice Department.",
      "Thousands of pages of documents related to Epstein, including emails, flight logs and other material, have already been released to the public by the House Oversight Committee and by a federal judge who oversaw the settlement of a lawsuit against Maxwell.",
      "What happens next?",
      "Even if it passes the House, the bill's fate in the Senate is uncertain.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, was noncommittal about bringing it up for a vote when asked in September. On Sunday, before Mr. Trump encouraged lawmakers to vote for the bill, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, expressed a similar sentiment.",
      "\"It'll come to the Senate. We'll take a look at it,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"But to me, this is not about truth. It's not about justice. This is about an attempt by the Democrats to make President Trump a lame duck president. I'm not going to aid and abet them in their efforts to do that.\"",
      "Johnson said he expects the Senate will make changes to the bill. Johnson does not believe the bill goes far enough to protect victims, but told reporters Monday, \"I do have some comfort that \u2026 if and when it's processed in the Senate, that they'll be able to correct some of those concerns.\"",
      "The bill would be sent back to the House for approval if it's amended in the Senate.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Monday he would sign the bill if it makes it to his desk.",
      "The president also has the power to order the Justice Department to release the files without action from Congress, but he has not indicated any plans to do so.",
      "Lawmakers push for Epstein files' release",
      "The bill's lead sponsors \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 have led the charge in the House for the documents' release. First, they introduced legislation that would force the Justice Department to make Epstein-related files public within 30 days, and they later used a procedural maneuver to bypass House leaders, who control what legislation hits the floor.",
      "The procedural maneuver, known as a discharge petition, secured the final signature needed to force a vote last Wednesday, when newly seated Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona added her name. Her swearing-in was delayed for seven weeks while the House was on an extended break during the shutdown.",
      "Instead of waiting until early December, when Johnson would be required to hold a vote on the issue under the rules governing the discharge petition process, the speaker is now seeking to move on sooner.",
      "\"It's a totally pointless exercise,\" Johnson said last week about why he was now choosing to accelerate the vote. \"It is completely moot now. We might as well just do it.\"",
      "Massie said Johnson's decision to drag out the vote for months \"caused nothing but political pain.\" Greene called Mr. Trump's previous opposition to releasing the files a \"huge miscalculation.\"",
      "Anywhere from 40 to more than 100 House Republicans could end up voting for passage, Massie and Khanna have predicted.",
      "Johnson has repeatedly criticized the effort by Democrats and some Republicans to force a vote, saying their measure lacked enough protections for Epstein's victims. More recently, Johnson has touted the House Oversight Committee's investigation as sufficient.",
      "The Republican-led committee has so far released tens of thousands of documents from Epstein's estate and the Justice Department, as well as transcripts from interviews with former government officials about their handling of the case. The committee has also sought to depose Maxwell.",
      "The most recent release contained text messages and emails from Epstein in which he alluded to having dirt on Mr. Trump. In his correspondence with others, Epstein said of Mr. Trump, \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" and referred to him as the \"dog that hasn't barked.\"",
      "\"You see, I know how dirty Donald is,\" Epstein wrote in an email chain discussing a 2018 New York Times opinion column on impeachment.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crimes related to the Epstein case. He and Epstein knew each other in New York and Palm Beach social circles in the 1990s and early 2000s, but Mr. Trump has said he cut ties years ago.",
      "Even Republicans who have supported making the Epstein materials public have defended Mr. Trump against criticism of his appearances in the files, arguing Democrats have cherry-picked details to damage the president.",
      "Trump weighs in",
      "Mr. Trump has accused Democrats of focusing on Epstein to deflect from the shutdown, which ended last week after 43 days. He also said he's ordering the Justice Department to investigate Epstein's relationships with prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, and major financial institutions.",
      "But late Sunday, Mr. Trump ended his pressure campaign against the House bill, saying \"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had previously lashed out at Republicans supportive of the efforts, calling them \"weak and ineffective.\" In recent days, he pulled his endorsement from Greene, who was once a close ally, bashing her as a \"traitor.\"",
      "Greene said the Epstein files \"sent him over the edge\" and alleged Mr. Trump had directed his ire at her \"to scare all the other Republicans\" from voting to make the materials public.",
      "\"It's astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,\" she wrote on Friday.",
      "On Saturday, she added, \"It really makes you wonder what is in those files and who and what country is putting so much pressure on him?\"",
      "Massie pondered Sunday whether Mr. Trump's directive for the Justice Department to investigate Clinton and others was an attempt to block the files from becoming public.",
      "\"If they have ongoing investigations in certain areas, those documents can't be released,\" Massie told ABC News' \"This Week.\" \"So this might be a big smoke screen \u2026 a last-ditch effort to prevent the release of the Epstein files.\"",
      "Trump administration's handling of Epstein files",
      "The Trump administration's handling of the Epstein materials has divided Mr. Trump's base.",
      "Some of those who believe that the federal government has concealed information about Epstein to protect powerful figures have been disappointed by his administration's disclosures so far.",
      "When right-wing influencers visited the White House in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi gave the group binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" But she faced criticism after the influencers said that the binders contained documents that had been public for years.",
      "Months later, a July memo from the Justice Department and FBI said they had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of material related to Epstein and \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" There was no \"client list\" or \"credible evidence\" that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures, according to the memo, which also confirmed that Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail.",
      "Bondi had previously suggested a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk.",
      "After pressure from members of both parties, the Trump administration asked courts to unseal grand jury materials from the Epstein and Maxwell cases earlier this year, but those moves have been rejected by judges.",
      "Jaala  Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement. \"While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.\"",
      "Dozens of messages between Summers and Epstein were included in a trove of documents from Epstein's estate that was released by the House Oversight Committee last week.",
      "The emails show Summers and Epstein communicated regularly during the last years of Epstein's life, even as the accused sex trafficker's public infamy and notoriety grew. Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",
      "In one March 2019 exchange, the pair appeared to banter about a woman that Summers knew in London, with Epstein seeming to offer advice to the Harvard professor.",
      "\"I said what are you up to,\" Summers wrote in part of one message, describing a conversation with the woman. \"She said 'I'm busy.' I said awfully coy u are.\"",
      "Epstein's reply read, in part: \"shes smart. making you pay for past errors.\"",
      "In a separate conversation, Epstein appears to call himself Summers' \"wing man.\"",
      "There is no evidence of illegal conduct on the part of Summers.",
      "It's not clear what public commitments Summers will call off. An economist by training, he has remained a professor at Harvard University since stepping down as the Ivy League school's president in 2006. He currently teaches two classes at the Harvard Kennedy School on globalization and U.S. economic policy, according to the school's course catalog.",
      "A former Treasury Secretary during the Clinton administration, Summers is an influential voice on economic policy. He advised former President Barack Obama during the financial crisis, and he publicly tangled with the Biden administration over its approach to post-COVID-19 economic stimulus.",
      "Epstein's ties with Harvard were well known. The late financier donated upward of $9 million to the university prior to his 2008 guilty plea in Florida, Harvard found in a 2020 investigation. The school said it didn't accept donations from Epstein after that, but he continued to engage with faculty and visit the school dozens of times",
      "CBS News has reached out to Harvard for comment.",
      "President Trump called on the Justice Department last week to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton and other high-profile Democrats. A spokesperson for former President Clinton said he wasn't aware of Epstein's actions and didn't do anything wrong.",
      "Mr. Trump's own relationship with Epstein has also drawn intense scrutiny. The two men traveled in the same Manhattan and Palm Beach social circles for a period of time, but Mr. Trump says he cut ties many years ago. The president hasn't been charged with a crime or been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Epstein regularly brought up Mr. Trump in the emails that were released last week. In one correspondence, Epstein said of the president, \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" referring to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing related to Epstein, and has called the controversy over it a \"hoax\" perpetuated by Democrats.",
      "Daniel  Ruetenik\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "The most advanced U.S. aircraft carrier has arrived in the Caribbean Sea in a display of American military power.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. is set to designate Cartel de los Soles \u2014 a group that the Trump administration has claimed is headed by Venezuela's president \u2014 as a foreign terrorist organization, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Sunday night, hours after the most advanced aircraft carrier in the nation crossed into the Caribbean Sea, the U.S. Navy said.",
      "Rubio's announcement and the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford mark a major moment in what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation but has been seen as an escalating pressure tactic against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Cartel de los Soles' designation as a foreign terrorist organization is set to go into effect on Nov. 24, Rubio said in a statement. He alleged the cartel is headed by Maduro and \"other high-ranking individuals of the illegitimate Maduro regime who have corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary.\"",
      "\"Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,\" Rubio added. \"Cartel de los Soles by and with other designated FTOs including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel are responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters Sunday night after the announcement was made, President Trump said, \"We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we'll see how that turns out. They would like to talk.\"",
      "Cartel de los Soles is not known to be a traditional, hierarchical drug cartel like the Sinaloa or Tren de Aragua The term is instead generally used to describe a loose, decentralized network of military and government officials within the Venezuelan state who are alleged to be involved in the illegal drug trade.",
      "The U.S. has asserted that Maduro is complicit with armed criminal gangs that smuggle drugs into the U.S., allegations that Maduro has rejected. And over the last two months, the U.S. military has\u00a0conducted strikes against at least 22 vessels it alleges were ferrying drugs from South America to the U.S., killing at least 83 people.",
      "\"Through unwavering commitment and the precise use of our forces, we stand ready to combat the transnational threats that seek to destabilize our region,\" Adm. Alvin Holsey, commander of U.S. Southern Command, said Sunday in a statement announcing the USS Ford's arrival in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group's deployment represents a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere and the safety of the American Homeland,\" he added. Southern Command is the primary combatant unit for operations in the Caribbean and South America.",
      "The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations, in what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dubbed Operation Southern Spear. The Ford's carrier strike group, which includes squadrons of fighter jets and guided-missile destroyers, transited the Anegada Passage near the British Virgin Islands on Sunday morning, the Navy said.",
      "Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the Ford's carrier strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to \"protect our nation's security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "The administration has insisted that the buildup of warships is focused on stopping the flow of drugs into the U.S., but it has released no evidence to support its assertions that those killed in the boats were \"narco-terrorists.\"",
      "President Trump said Friday that he's \"sort of\" decided how to proceed on Venezuela, as\u00a0top officials\u00a0weigh potential military operations in the Latin American country. \"I sort of have made up my mind\" about the administration's next steps in Venezuela, he told CBS News aboard Air Force One, but \"I can't tell you what it would be.\"",
      "Top Trump administration officials, military and senior staff gathered at the White House for at least the third day in a row on Friday to discuss possible military operations in Venezuela, according to sources familiar with the matter. Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were among those who spoke with Mr. Trump at the White House on Friday, the sources said.",
      "Venezuela was also discussed as part of the president's daily intelligence briefing on Wednesday. CBS News has\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that Hegseth, Caine and other military officials presented Mr. Trump on Wednesday with options for potential operations in\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0in the coming days, including possible strikes on land.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuela announced Tuesday that it was\u00a0launching a massive military exercise\u00a0across the country, reportedly involving some 200,000 forces.",
      "Many people both inside Venezuela, including Maduro himself, and observers outside the country believe the increased U.S. military pressure is\u00a0aimed at forcing Maduro out of office.",
      "When asked\u00a0in a recent interview with \"60 Minutes\" if Maduro's \"days were numbered,\" Mr. Trump responded, \"I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.\" Mr. Trump\u00a0last month also confirmed\u00a0that he had authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela.",
      "The president has justified the attacks on drug boats by saying the U.S. is in \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels while claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations. He has faced pushback from leaders in the region, the U.N. human rights chief and lawmakers, including some Republicans, who have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the boat strikes.",
      "Senate Republicans\u00a0recently voted to reject legislation that would have put a check on Mr. Trump's ability to launch an attack against Venezuela without congressional authorization. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only Republicans to support the resolution, which failed in a 49-51 vote.",
      "Experts disagree on whether or not American warplanes may be used to strike land targets inside Venezuela. Either way, the 100,000-ton warship is sending a message, one expert said.",
      "\"This is the anchor of what it means to have U.S. military power once again in Latin America,\" Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst for the Andes region, told The Associated Press. \"And it has raised a lot of anxieties in Venezuela but also throughout the region. I think everyone is watching this with sort of bated breath to see just how willing the U.S. is to really use military force.\"",

      "\"Today we filed a lawsuit to strike down California's unconstitutional law aimed at unmasking the faces of our federal agents, which will allow criminals to dox them,\" Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, wrote on X. \"Unconstitutional laws such as this one further endanger our brave men and women protecting our community.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the lawsuit in a statement to CBS News.",

      "The lawsuit against California argues the state is discriminating against federal agents as it exempts some state officials from the mask ban.",

    "story": [
      "The U.N. Security Council on Monday approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the devastated territory and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Russia, which had circulated a rival resolution, abstained along with China on the 13-0 vote. The U.S. and other countries had hoped Moscow would not use its veto power on the United Nations' most powerful body to block the resolution's adoption.",
      "The vote was a crucial next step for the fragile ceasefire and efforts to outline Gaza's future following two years of war between Israel and Hamas. Arab and other Muslim countries that expressed interest in providing troops for an international force had signaled that Security Council authorization was essential for their participation.",
      "The ceasefire went into effect on Oct. 10, but accusations of violations of the terms by both Hamas and Israel had threatened to upend the deal in the weeks since its implementation.",
      "The first phase of the deal called for Hamas to release all living and deceased hostages in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel. While the living hostages were returned by the deadline, the remains of some of the dead hostages had not been handed over \u2014 with both Hamas and U.S. officials citing the difficulties in recovering some of the remains amid the destruction in the Gaza Strip \u2014 which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said constituted a violation.",
      "There have also been flare-ups of violence in Gaza, including airstrikes from Israel, which it said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces, since the deal went into effect. International advocates have also accused Israel of not adhering to the requirement to deliver all of the aid it promised to Gaza in the deal.",
      "The U.S. resolution endorses President Trump's 20-point ceasefire plan, which calls for a yet-to-be-established Board of Peace as a transitional authority that Mr. Trump would head. It also authorizes the stabilization force and gives it a wide mandate, including overseeing the borders, providing security and demilitarizing the territory. Authorization for the board and force expires at the end of 2027.",
      "\"Congratulations to the World on the incredible Vote of the United Nations Security Council, just moments ago, acknowledging and endorsing the BOARD OF PEACE, which will be chaired by me, and include the most powerful and respected Leaders throughout the World,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media following the U.N. vote. He thanked the members of the Security Council, including Russia and China, and said, \"The members of the Board, and many more exciting announcements, will be made in the coming weeks.\"",
      "Hamas criticized the U.N.'s adoption of the plan, saying, \"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation,\" according to Reuters.",
      "\"Any international force, if established, must be stationed solely on the borders to separate the forces and monitor the ceasefire, and must be entirely under the supervision of the United Nations,\" Hamas said, according to Al Jazeera.",
      "During nearly two weeks of negotiations on the U.S. resolution, Arab nations and the Palestinians had pressed the United States to strengthen the original weak language about Palestinian self-determination.",
      "The U.S. revised it to say that after the Palestinian Authority \u2014 which now governs parts of the West Bank \u2014 makes reforms and after redevelopment of the devastated Gaza Strip advances, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\"",
      "\"The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,\" it adds.",
      "That language angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed Sunday to oppose any attempt to establish a Palestinian state. He has long asserted that creating a Palestinian state would reward Hamas and eventually lead to an even larger Hamas-run state on Israel's borders.",
      "A key to the resolution's adoption was support from Arab and Muslim nations pushing for a ceasefire and potentially contributing to the international force. The U.S. mission to the U.N. distributed a joint statement Friday with Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan and Turkey calling for \"swift adoption\" of the U.S. proposal.",
      "The vote took place amid hopes that Gaza's fragile ceasefire would be maintained after a war set off by Hamas' surprise terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel's more than two-year offensive has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.",
      "Russia last week suddenly circulated a rival proposal with stronger language supporting a Palestinian state alongside Israel and stressed that the West Bank and Gaza must be joined as a state under the Palestinian Authority.",
      "It also stripped out references to the transitional board and asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to provide options for an international force to provide security in Gaza and for implementing the ceasefire plan, stressing the importance of a Security Council role.",
      "The U.S. resolution calls for the stabilization force to ensure \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\" and \"the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.\" A big question is how to disarm Hamas, which has not fully accepted that step.",
      "It authorizes the force \"to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate\" in compliance with international law, which is U.N. language for the use of military force.",
      "The resolution says the stabilization troops will help secure border areas, along with a Palestinian police force that they have trained and vetted, and they will coordinate with other countries to secure the flow of humanitarian assistance. It says the force should closely consult and cooperate with neighboring Egypt and Israel.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-orders-grand-jury-material-given-to-comey/",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 19:22:45 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal magistrate judge wrote that there is a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in the case involving former FBI Director James Comey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal magistrate judge on Monday ordered federal prosecutors to turn over all grand jury material to former FBI Director James Comey's defense team, harshly criticizing the Justice Department for a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in its handling of the case against the ex-FBI chief.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick allowed Comey's legal team to get access to all grand jury materials, including transcripts and evidence presented to the grand jury that indicted Comey on two charges relating to past testimony to Congress. Fitzpatrick also ordered the Justice Department to turn over the complete audio recordings of the proceedings to Comey's legal team.",
      "Comey has pleaded not guilty to both counts, which stem from alleged misstatements he made to the Senate Judiciary Committee during a September 2020 hearing. The former FBI director was indicted just days before the statute of limitations on those offenses ran out.",
      "The judge recognized the magnitude of his decision to allow Comey's lawyers access to the grand jury material, which is typically kept secret, writing in a scathing 24-page decision that he is granting an \"extraordinary remedy\" to fully protect Comey's legal rights. Fitzpatrick said such a step is warranted because of \"the prospect that government misconduct may have tainted the grand jury proceedings.\"",
      "\"The Court recognizes that the relief sought by the defense is rarely granted,\" he wrote. \"However, the record points to a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps, missteps that led an FBI agent and a prosecutor to potentially undermine the integrity of the grand jury proceeding.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick wrote that \"procedural and substantive irregularities that occurred before the grand jury, and the manner in which evidence presented to the grand jury was collected and used, may rise to the level of government misconduct resulting in prejudice to Mr. Comey.\"",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is prosecuting Comey, did not immediately return a request for comment. The Justice Department had no comment. Prosecutors asked the district court to freeze Fitzpatrick's order directing them to turn over the grand jury materials to Comey's defense team in order to file objections.",
      "\"The government's position is that disclosure of grand jury materials is not warranted under the facts presented to the Magistrate Judge. Indeed, the government believes the Magistrate Judge may have misinterpreted some facts he found when issuing the latest order to release the grand jury materials to the defendant,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "Fitzpatrick's role in the case stems from the government's request to implement a filter protocol to govern its handling and the disclosure of potentially privileged material that was seized in 2019 and 2020 as part of a separate investigation and was never returned. Comey's team opposed the move and argued that the information the government wanted to review was improperly retained after the end of that earlier investigation and improperly used in the probe involving Comey.",
      "The ex-FBI director is seeking access to the grand-jury material as part of a bid to have the indictment dismissed because of alleged irregularities in those proceedings.",
      "At a hearing earlier this month, Fitzpatrick admonished\u00a0the Justice Department for what he said is its posture to \"indict first, investigate second.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick himself reviewed the grand jury materials and wrote in his decision that he identified two statements Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, made to the grand jurors that \"on their face appear to be fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the integrity of the grand jury process.\"",
      "Portions of the decision \u2014 including Halligan's comments \u2014 are redacted, but Fitzpatrick said both were made in response to questions from grand jurors and are \"directly related to communications involving Comey.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said one statement Halligan made to the grand jury \"suggests\" that Comey does not have a constitutional right to not testify at trial. The second remark from Halligan suggested that the grand jury \"did not have to rely on only the record before them\" and that there was \"more evidence \u2014 perhaps better evidence\" that the Justice Department had that would be used at trial, the judge said.",
      "The material at issue was seized by the FBI in 2019 and 2020 in response to court-authorized search warrants for accounts and devices belonging to Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University who is a friend of Comey. Richman worked as a special government employee at the FBI during Comey's tenure as director, and was his private attorney as of May 2017, when Mr. Trump fired Comey during his first term.",
      "Fitzpatrick said the materials seized from Richman were the \"cornerstone\" of Halligan's presentation to the grand jury that voted to indict Comey, even though they had been retrieved five years earlier as part of the separate investigation that has since been closed.",
      "The government also appears to have access to information it seized from Richman that was outside the scope of the search warrants, the judge said, even though agents had been instructed to seal any information that did not fall within the contours of the warrants.",
      "\"The government appears to have conflated its obligation to protect privileged information \u2013 an obligation it approached casually at best in this case \u2013 with its duty to seize only those materials authorized by the Court,\" he wrote. \"This cavalier attitude towards a basic tenet of the Fourth Amendment and multiple court orders left the government unchecked to rummage through all of the information seized from Mr. Richman, and apparently, in the government's eyes, to do so again anytime they chose.\"",
      "While the investigation involving Richman was closed in September 2021 and no charges were filed, the bureau \"chose to rummage through\" the seized material again this summer, when the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia began a criminal investigation into Comey, the judge said.",
      "Fitzpatrick wrote that despite the investigation into Comey starting this year, \"inexplicably, the government elected not to seek a new warrant for the 2025 search,\" of Richman's devices, \"even though the 2025 investigation was focused on a different person, was exploring a fundamentally different legal theory, and was predicated on an entirely different set of criminal offenses.\"",
      "If the Justice Department had sought new warrants, Fitzpatrick wrote it likely would have resulted in \"a delay the investigative team could not afford given that the statute of limitations would expire in a mere 18 days.\" Additionally, the judge said the parameters of a 2025 search would likely have been narrower in scope than the original warrants authorized for Richman's devices and accounts.",
      "The rush to prosecute Comey over his testimony in the face of the statute of limitations running out also resulted in the appointment of one of Mr. Trump's former aides and personal attorneys, Halligan, to lead the federal prosecutor's office in the Eastern District of Virginia. Both Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was also indicted under Halligan's supervision, are challenging her appointment as unconstitutional.",
      "James was indicted on charges of bank fraud last month and pleaded not guilty.",
      "Halligan appeared before the grand jury on Sept. 25, but Fitzpatrick said that same day, before her presentation, an unidentified FBI agent alerted the lead case agent and a lawyer with the FBI's Office of General Counsel that evidence obtained during the investigation into Comey may have been subject to attorney-client privilege or constitute attorney-client confidential information.",
      "But instead of removing himself from the investigative team until any potential issues were resolved, the judge said the lead case agent appeared before the grand jury \"undeterred\" and testified in support of bringing charges against Comey. That federal agent was the only person to testify before the grand jury.",
      "\"The government's decision to allow an agent who was exposed to potentially privileged information to testify before a grand jury is highly irregular and a radical departure from past DOJ practice,\" Fitzpatrick wrote.",
      "Fitzpatrick's findings Monday are among numerous legal threads that have imperiled the Comey prosecution.",
      "Last week, a South Carolina federal judge heard arguments from both Comey's and James' legal teams on the legality of Halligan's appointment to lead the Eastern District of Virginia, with both requesting the judge dismiss the indictments against them because Halligan's appointment was unlawful. The judge overseeing that argument said she will have a ruling by next week.",
      "Meanwhile, Comey's attorneys will be back in court Wednesday, where they will argue that the indictment against Comey was \"vindictive and selective\" and should separately be dismissed on those grounds.",

The bill would compel the release of flight logs, travel records, names of individuals and entities referenced in any Epstein case and internal Justice Department communications within 30 days of the legislation's passage.

      "In a 22-page filing Monday, James alleged the charges were the product of \"months of illegal and unethical behavior\" by Fair Housing Finance Authority (FHFA) Director Bill Pulte, top Justice Department official Ed Martin and interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan.",

      "Her legal team also called the origins of the James probe \"suspect,\" claiming Pulte may have relied on either a \"fringe blogger,\" records in county databases that he bought or Fannie Mae loan files that were \"unlawfully accessed.\"",
      "According to James' legal team, Pulte sent a private letter to Halligan, a former White House aide who is leading the prosecutions of James and former FBI Director James Comey, summarizing information on James' properties. That information, they say, was then used in part in James' grand jury proceedings.",

      "In a statement, a DHS spokesperson expressed their \"appreciation\" to Richardson and wished him \"continued success in his return to the private sector,\" and outlined some of the things he oversaw in his short tenure at the helm of FEMA.",
      "Richardson's resignation comes amid mounting criticism over FEMA's response to the devastating Ccentral Texas floods in July, which claimed more than 130 lives, including 27 campers and counselors at Camp Mystic on the Guadalupe River. Richardson was sharply criticized \u2013 including by lawmakers on Capitol Hill \u2013 for being inaccessible during the crisis, with FEMA officials telling CBS News that the acting administrator was unreachable for hours, complicating efforts to deploy search-and-rescue teams.",
      "At a congressional hearing in July, Richardson defended FEMA's performance as a \"model\" of disaster response, disputing reports of delayed deployments and unanswered calls. He also denied there were lapses in contracts for FEMA's disaster help line.",
      "In one widely reported gaffe, Richardson also told colleagues he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season \u2014 comments sources say raised serious concerns among seasoned emergency managers.",
      "Critics\u2014including current and former FEMA employees\u2014have also pointed to bureaucratic bottlenecks under Noem's leadership, including a directive that any expenditure over $100,000 require the DHS secretary's personal sign-off.",
      "Richardson's resignation lands at roughly the same time that the FEMA Review Council is expected to deliver a sweeping report to the president, outlining recommendations to restructure and reshape the agency. The council's work was ordered by the White House to conduct a comprehensive assessment of FEMA's performance during the Biden administration and deliver a formal report to the president in November. President Trump has repeatedly signaled that FEMA \"should be eliminated as it exists,\" with Noem directing the council not merely to evaluate the agency but to fundamentally \"reimagine\" it.",

    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri and North Carolina redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina is now the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms, following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their House maps, along with a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.",
      "The redistricting push began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats, which was approved by voters on Election Day by a 29-point margin.",
      "In Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map earlier this month to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, signed the legislation on Sunday. In October, North Carolina Republicans targeted a single Democratic district as well, passing a map that redraws the 1st Congressional District to make it lean more heavily Republican.",
      "Utah lawmakers also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans, but a judge in November threw out the GOP-controlled legislature's map and ordered one that will create a Democratic-leaning district in Salt Lake City.",
      "Challenges remain in all states. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create the new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Civil rights groups are also suing in Texas, claiming the maps are racially biased. Despite getting the seal of approval by voters in California, state Republicans filed a lawsuit against Prop 50 after Election Day.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, including Indiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "Utah redistricting",
      "Utah's redistricting is different from the other states' campaigns, starting with the fact that the state does not have any Democratic members of Congress. The redistricting push also wasn't kicked off by Mr. Trump and Republicans or in retaliation for moves by other states. Utah's 2025 redistricting was put in motion this summer when a judge ruled the current districts were in violation of a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature put forward four maps for public comment, and ultimately on Oct. 6 approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. The legislature proposed a map that will split Salt Lake County into two districts, which would make Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But a district court judge in Utah on Nov. 10 rejected redistricting maps selected by the Republican-controlled legislature and instead selected a map that would create a Democratic-leaning congressional district in Salt Lake City. The map approved by the legislature \"does not comply with Utah law,\" wrote 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson in her opinion. She continued that \"based on the evidence presented,\" the Legislature map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "Utah currently has four representatives in Congress, all of whom are Republicans. Both senators are also Republicans. The maps enacted by Gibson create a new district encompassing Salt Lake City that would be 62% Democratic, based on the 2024 presidential results.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will not reconsider a 25-year-old decision that found student-led and initiated prayer at football games unconstitutional.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a legal fight involving a Christian school that wanted to broadcast a pregame prayer over the stadium loudspeaker before a championship football game, turning away a major religious liberty dispute on the heels of a 2022 decision involving prayer in schools.",
      "In rejecting the appeal, the high court will not reconsider a 25-year-old decision that found student-led and initiated prayer at football games unconstitutional. There were no noted dissents.",
      "The legal battle before the justices was brought by a Tampa-based Christian school that wanted to broadcast a brief prayer before a state championship football game through the stadium's public-address system. But the Florida High School Athletic Association denied the request, which the schools argued violated their rights to free exercise of religion and free speech.",
      "The school, Cambridge Christian, asked the Supreme Court to overturn its 2000 ruling in the case Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe. In that decision, the court held that the school district's policy of allowing student-led, student-initiated prayer at football games violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.",
      "But in declining to take up the appeal from the school, that 25-year-old decision will remain in place. Also left intact is a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in favor of the FHSAA, which found that use of the loudspeaker by the Christian schools to engage in communal prayer before a state-organized football game would be government speech.",
      "The dispute dates back to 2015, when Cambridge Christian School and University Christian were set to square off in the Class 2A state championship, played at the Citrus Bowl in Orlando. Ahead of the championship game set for that December, a representative for University Christian asked the state athletics association for permission to say a pregame prayer over the stadium's loudspeaker.",
      "But the association informed the schools that neither would be allowed to use the public-address system to broadcast a prayer before the game. The then-head of Cambridge Christian re-upped the request to Dr. Roger Dearing, executive director of the Florida athletics group, asking he \"allow two Christian schools to honor their Lord before the game and pray\" over the loudspeaker.",
      "But Dearing denied the schools' request, and said he believed federal law prevented him from granting permission to broadcast a pre-game prayer because the Citrus Bowl is a public facility and the FHSAA is a \"state actor,\" and therefore cannot allow communal prayer. The athletics association instead suggested the two schools come together before the start of the game to pray, which they did.",
      "After the game, Dearing told the schools that he believed that if the athletic association were to allow prayer over the broadcast system, the state could be seen as endorsing or promoting religion in violation of the Establishment Clause. He cited the Supreme Court's 2000 decision in the dispute involving the Santa Fe Independent School District.",
      "Cambridge Christian sued the FHSAA in 2016, alleging that it had violated its First Amendment rights. A federal district court ruled in favor of the athletics association in March 2022. As to the school's free speech claims, the trial court found the pregame speech broadcast over the PA system at the state championship game is government speech.",
      "As to the free exercise claims, the court ruled that Cambridge Christian's religious rights were not violated when it was refused access to the loudspeaker for pregame prayer. The school appealed the decision.",
      "After the district court's ruling, the Florida legislature enacted a law requiring the FHSAA to allow schools participating in a high school championship contest the chance to make brief opening remarks, if requested, through the public address system.",
      "When the 11th Circuit reviewed the district court's decision, it agreed that pregame speech over the PA system at a FHSAA football championship game \u2014 which takes place at a neutral site \u2014 constitutes government speech.",
      "The appeals court also rejected Cambridge Christian's free exercise claim, finding that the FHSAA was regulating its own expression when it prevented pregame speech over the public-address system at the 2015 championship game.",
      "The school appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the athletic association allowed private speech over its loudspeaker but impermissibly censored private religious speech, only because it was religious.",
      "Its lawyers warned in a filing that if the 11th Circuit's decision were to stand, \"state actors will be able to claim that virtually all private speech and religious exercise in a government setting lacks First Amendment protection.\"",

    "summary": "The documents include military reports about the search as well as memos, telegrams and newspaper clippings.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. National Archives has published a batch of newly declassified government records on Amelia Earhart, the American aviator who vanished over the Pacific in 1937.",
      "Earhart went missing while on a pioneering round-the-world flight with navigator Fred Noonan, and her disappearance is one of the most tantalizing mysteries in aviation lore.",
      "President Trump ordered the declassification and release in September of all U.S. government records related to Earhart's ill-fated final flight.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the documents released on Friday included \"newly declassified files from the National Security Agency, information on Earhart's last known communications, weather and plane conditions at the time, and potential search locations, as well as subsequent inquiries and theories regarding her disappearance.\"",
      "Further documents would be publicly released on the National Archives website on a \"rolling basis\" as they are declassified, Gabbard said in a statement.",
      "The documents include a July 1937 radio log from Itasca, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter that was deployed to support Earhart's flight around the world. Itasca was the last ship to have radio contact with Earhart and Noonan before their aircraft disappeared. The phrase \"Earhart Unheard\" appears numerous times in the log.",
      "According to the National Archives, the last communication from Earhart's plane came at about 8:43 a.m. on Jul 2, 1937: \"We are on the line 157 337 wl rept msg we wl rept\u2026\"",
      "The documents also include military reports about the search as well as memos, telegrams and newspaper clippings.",
      "Among them is the July 16, 1960, front page of the San Mateo Times with the headline: \"Ex-Serviceman Claims He Saw Earhart Grave.\" Former Army Sergeant Thomas Devine told the newspaper that while serving in Saipan, a native on the island showed him an unmarked grave of two white people \"who came from the sky.\" Devine said he believed it to be the grave of Earhart and Noonan.",
      "In a separate newspaper article, dated Nov. 18, 1970, a researcher claimed that a former Pan American Airways employee had records indicating Earhart survived the crash and sent a distress call that was received by the airline.",
      "Many of the thousands of documents published online on Friday have been released previously by the National Archives or made available to researchers, and aviation experts consider it unlikely that the latest material will shed any new light on Earhart's disappearance.",
      "Earhart's final flight has fascinated historians for decades and spawned books, movies and theories galore.",
      "The prevailing belief is that Earhart, 39, and Noonan, 44, ran out of fuel and ditched their twin-engine Lockheed Electra in the Pacific near Howland Island while on one of the final legs of their epic journey.",
      "Earhart, who won fame in 1932 as the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, took off on May 20, 1937, from Oakland, California, hoping to become the first woman to fly around the world.",
      "She and Noonan vanished on July 2, 1937, after taking off from Lae, Papua New Guinea, on a challenging 2,500-mile flight to refuel on Howland Island, a speck of a U.S. territory between Australia and Hawaii.",
      "They never made it.",
      "Efforts to find the aircraft have continued to this day. Last month, an\u00a0expedition\u00a0to try to locate Earhart's plane on a remote island in the Pacific was delayed until next year.",
      "A team of researchers was planning to travel to Nikumaroro Island in early November to determine whether something known as the Taraia Object \u2014 a visual anomaly seen in satellite and other imagery \u2014 is Earhart's aircraft. They are now awaiting additional clearances from local authorities as they work through the permit approvals, and cannot go later this year due to the start of cyclone season.",
      "The underwater object has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, the year after Earhart and Noonan disappeared.",
      "Researchers previously said there is\u00a0\"very strong\" evidence\u00a0that the object, which is in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a small island in Kiribati about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, is the iconic aviator's plane. Some, however, have expressed skepticism. \"We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there,\" Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, told\u00a0NBC News in July.",
      "A team of researchers from Purdue and the Archaeological Legacy Institute plan to take photos and videos of the site, then use magnetometers and sonar devices to scan the area. The item will then be dredged and lifted from the water so researchers can attempt to identify it.",
      "Last year, an expedition team\u00a0captured a sonar image\u00a0in the Pacific Ocean that appeared to resemble Earhart's plane resting at the bottom of the sea. It\u00a0turned out to be\u00a0a rock formation.",

    "summary": "From Miami to San Diego, schools around the U.S. are seeing big drops in enrollment of students from immigrant families as President Trump's immigration crackdown makes itself felt in numerous ways.",
    "story": [
      "From Miami to San Diego, schools around the U.S. are seeing big drops in enrollment of students from immigrant families.",
      "In some cases, parents have been deported or voluntarily returned to their home countries, driven out by President Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown. Others have moved elsewhere inside the U.S.",
      "In many school systems, the biggest factor is that far fewer families are coming from other countries. As fewer people cross the U.S. border, administrators in small towns and big cities alike are reporting fewer newcomer students than usual.",
      "In Miami-Dade County Public Schools, about 2,550 students have entered the district from another country so far this school year - down from nearly 14,000 last year, and more than 20,000 the year before that. School board member Luisa Santos, who attended district schools herself as a young immigrant, said the trend is \"a sad reality.\"",
      "\"I was one of those arrivals when I was 8 years old,\" Santos said. \"And this country and our public schools - I'll never get tired of saying it - gave me everything.\"",
      "Collectively, the enrollment declines in Miami-Dade erased about $70 million from the district's annual budget, forcing administrators to scramble to cover the unexpected shortfall.",
      "The drops in immigrant students add to strains on enrollment at many traditional public schools, which have seen overall numbers dip due to demographic changes and students opting for alternatives like private schools and homeschooling. Despite needs for English instruction and social supports, the newcomers in some districts have helped to buoy enrollment and bring critical per-pupil funding in recent years.",
      "Alabama, Florida among states feeling impact",
      "In northern Alabama, Albertville City Schools Superintendent Bart Reeves has seen the local economy grow along with its Hispanic population, which for decades has been drawn by the area's poultry processing plants. Albertville soon will be getting its first Target store, a sign of the community's growing prosperity.",
      "Reeves' district is home to one of Alabama's largest Hispanic student populations, with about 60% identifying as Hispanic. But Reeves said the district's newcomer academy at a local high school hasn't been enrolling any new students.",
      "\"That's just not happening this year with the closure of the border,\" said Reeves, who expects the hit to his budget from enrollment declines will cost him about 12 teacher positions.",
      "One Sunday morning in August, Edna, a 63-year-old immigrant from El Salvador, got the call she had been dreading. Her friend, a mother from Guatemala with seven young children, had been detained in Lake Worth, Florida, on immigration charges while she was out grabbing a treat for her kids' breakfast.",
      "The family had prepared for this moment. There were legal documents in place granting temporary custody of the children to Edna, who asked to be identified only by her first name because she fears immigration enforcement.",
      "\"I'll be here, and we'll be OK,\" she recalled telling the oldest child, a 12-year-old boy.",
      "In the weeks that followed, Edna stayed home with two younger kids and got their five older siblings on the bus each day to attend Palm Beach County public schools, where enrollment has fallen by more than 6,000 students this year. One day in September, all seven children boarded a plane to Guatemala to be reunited with their mom, leaving behind neighborhood friends, band practices, and the only life they had ever known.",
      "\"My house feels like a garden without flowers,\" Edna said. \"They're all gone.\"",
      "The family is now living in a rural part of Guatemala, out of reach of phone service. School there had already started for the year and the mother, who did not attend school herself as a child, was keeping them home and weighing whether to enroll them next year, Edna said.",
      "The declines in the numbers of immigrants coming to the U.S. were already becoming evident in school registration numbers this summer.",
      "Effects showing in Denver, Chicago, Houston, Boston areas",
      "Denver Public Schools enrolled 400 new-to-country students this summer, compared to 1,500 during the previous summer. Outside Chicago, Waukegan Community Unified School District 60 signed up 100 fewer new immigrant students. And administrators in the Houston Independent School District shuttered the Las Americas Newcomer School, a program dedicated to children who are new to the U.S., after its enrollment fell to just 21 students from 111 last year.",
      "The shift is visible in places like Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city outside Boston that has long been a destination for new immigrants. The 6,000-student Chelsea Public Schools system has attracted Central Americans looking for affordable housing and, more recently, the state housed newly-arrived Haitians in shelters there. This year, the usual influx of newcomers didn't materialize.",
      "\"This year has been different. Much more quiet,\" said Daniel Mojica, director of Chelsea's parent information center.",
      "Over the summer, 152 newcomers signed up for Chelsea Public Schools, compared to 592 new-to-country students the previous summer.",
      "Some are also picking up and leaving. Since January, 844 students have withdrawn from the district, compared to 805 during the same period last year. Mojica said a greater share of students leaving - roughly a quarter - are returning to their native countries.",
      "He attributes that partly to the presence of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers walking the city's streets.",
      "\"You can feel the fear in the air,\" he said.",
      "San Diego principal says academics not only aspects of kids' lives hit",
      "In San Diego, Principal Fernando Hernandez has enrolled dozens of newcomer students from across Latin America over the past couple of years. Many made the treacherous journey through the jungles of the Darien Gap before setting up camp in a park near Perkins K-8 school.",
      "About a third of students at the school are homeless. Staff members have become experts on supporting kids who are facing adversity. As more newcomers arrived, Hernandez watched as Mexican American students switched up their playground slang to be better understood by their new classmates from Venezuela, Colombia and Peru.",
      "But so far this school year, he hasn't enrolled a single newcomer student. Other families did not return when the new school year began.",
      "Hernandez fears the toll of the disruption will extend far beyond students' academic progress. He worries students are missing out on chances to learn how to show empathy, to share, to disagree, to understand each other.",
      "\"This is like a repeat of the pandemic where the kids are isolated, locked up, not socializing,\" he said.",
      "\"These kids, they have to be in school,\" he added.",
      "Natacha, a parent who moved with her family to California after leaving Venezuela, said she tries to avoid going out in public, but continues sending her daughters to school. Natacha, who asked to only be identified by her first name because she fears immigration enforcement, said she braces herself as she drives the girls home each afternoon, scanning the road behind her in case another car is following hers.",
      "\"I entrust myself to God,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 06:05:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Aviation Administration says it is lifting all restrictions on commercial flights that were imposed during the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday it was lifting all restrictions on commercial flights that were imposed at 40 major airports during the country's longest government shutdown.",
      "Airlines were given permission to resume their regular flight schedules beginning Monday at 6 a.m. EST, the agency said.",
      "The announcement was made in a joint statement by Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford.",
      "Citing safety concerns as staffing shortages grew at air traffic control facilities during the shutdown, the FAA issued an unprecedented order to limit traffic in the skies. It had been in place since Nov. 7, affecting thousands of flights across the country.",
      "Impacted airports included large hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta.",
      "The flight cuts started at 4% and later grew to 6% before the FAA on Friday rolled the restrictions back to 3%, citing continued improvements in air traffic controller staffing since the record 43-day shutdown ended on Nov. 12.",
      "The number of flights canceled this weekend was at its lowest point since the order took effect and was well below the 3% cuts FAA was requiring for Saturday and Sunday. Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium showed that less than 1% of all flights were canceled this weekend. The flight tracking website FlightAware said 149 flights were cut Sunday and 315 were canceled on Saturday.",
      "The FAA statement said an agency safety team recommended the order be rescinded after \"detailed reviews of safety trends and the steady decline of staffing-trigger events in air traffic control facilities.\"",
      "The statement said the FAA \"is aware of reports of non-compliance by carriers over the course of the emergency order. The agency is reviewing and assessing enforcement options.\" It did not elaborate.",
      "Cancellations hit their highest point Nov. 9, when airlines cut more than 2,900 flights because of the FAA order, ongoing controller shortages and severe weather in parts of the country. Conditions began to improve throughout last week as more controllers returned to work amid news that Congress was close to a deal to end the shutdown. That progress also prompted the FAA to pause plans for further rate increases.",
      "The agency had initially aimed for a 10% reduction in flights. Duffy had said worrisome safety data showed the move was necessary to ease pressure on the aviation system and help manage worsening staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities as the shutdown entered its second month and flight disruptions began to pile up.",
      "Air traffic controllers were among the federal employees who had to continue working without pay throughout the shutdown. They missed two paychecks during the impasse.",
      "Duffy hasn't shared the specific safety data that prompted the cuts, but he cited reports during the shutdown of planes getting too close in the air, more runway incursions and pilot concerns about controllers' responses.",
      "Airline leaders have expressed optimism that operations would rebound in time for the Thanksgiving travel period after the FAA lifted its order.",

      "At midnight on New Year's Day \u2014 the first moment of 2026 \u2014 life will change for attorney Erika Evans for the second time in nine months.",
      "Evans will begin her term as the elected city attorney of Seattle on Jan. 1. Her campaign was a juggernaut \u2014 she won with nearly two-thirds of the vote on Nov. 4. But her campaign was also unexpected.",
      "Evans quit her position as an attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice in March, even though she had once considered that position a \"dream job.\"",
      "Amid a broader purge inside the agency, she opted to run for public office, rather than go into private legal practice or academia.",
      "Evans rolled to a primary victory in August and secured a larger margin of victory in this month's general election. As Seattle city attorney, Evans will represent the city in litigation and civil cases. She will also handle some prosecutions of lower-level criminal offenses.",
      "\"What we need at a time like this is fighters and people with grit and experience to fight what we are seeing,\" Evans told CBS News this weekend.",
      "Evans said the Trump administration's dismantling of the Justice Department's Civil Rights division was among her motivations for leaving her post at the federal prosecutor's office in the western district of Washington this year, where she was handling civil rights matters, hate crime cases and violent crime cases.",
      "She said that soon after Trump took office, the Justice Department leadership sent emails\u00a0 \"requiring that we report any colleagues doing diversity work in the office. We had 10 to 14 days to report them or we would get in trouble ourselves.\u00a0 That was pretty disgusting.\" She said she didn't feel safe at the agency, in part because she was the co-chair of a diversity effort.",
      "Soon after her departure in March, Evans launched her campaign for the Seattle city attorney's position and parlayed her frustration with the Trump administration into a component of her campaign message. In a campaign video, Evans pledged to challenge Mr. Trump: \"With your vote, I'll take on Trump and demand the community safety we deserve.\"",
      "Speaking to CBS News after her victory, Evans discussed a series of plans. She said she will make it a first priority to expedite the processing of DUI and domestic violence cases \"to make sure we're being good stewards of public safety.\"",
      "Evans said she will also monitor for \u2013 and take legal action against \u2013 any \"federal overreach\" into the city by the Trump administration, which has already triggered legal battles with other U.S. cities this year, from Washington, D.C. to Portland to Los Angeles.",
      "Evans is one of more than 5,000 Justice Department employees to quit, retire or face termination since January, according to a review by the Justice Connection group, which is a support organization for ousted and former Justice Department workers.",
      "Stacey Young, the Justice Connection founder and executive director, told CBS News that \"federal prosecutors are deeply committed to public service, and more are pursuing that mission through elected office when staying at the Justice Department becomes infeasible. We need people across the political spectrum fighting to uphold the rule of law, including at the local level.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said Sunday that drones pose \"the threat of humanity's lifetime,\" as officials have warned of escalating aerial security risks. But he said he's hopeful about the U.S.' approach.",
      "\"If you look at the speed and scale of the devastation that can come from drones, we as a federal government have got to lead on it,\" Driscoll said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"But I'm really optimistic. This is actually something we are doing right.\"",
      "Driscoll outlined that the U.S. Army has been put in charge of the counter-drone threat for the Pentagon, and is working \"hand in glove with the law enforcement agencies.\"",
      "\"What we are trying to do \u2014 because this problem is different from nearly anything faced in a long time \u2014 is a flying IED,\" Driscoll said, referring to Improvised Explosive Devices. \"They're cheap, you can 3D-print them at home, and they cross borders incredibly quickly.\"",
      "The comments come after Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CBS News last week that the threat to military sites and large civilian gatherings \"is severe and growing,\" citing evidence of persistent drone incursions and gaps in law enforcement authorities.",
      "Last year, there were more than 350 unauthorized drone flights over about 100 military installations, according to the Defense Department, along with more than 27,000 drones detected within 500 meters of the U.S. southern border in the last half of 2024. Meanwhile, the number of unauthorized flights during sporting events went down slightly last year, although the overall trend is continuing to move upward, according to NFL data.",
      "Driscoll said the Army is working with law enforcement agencies at borders and ports, and at major events like upcoming NFL games, the Olympics and the World Cup.",
      "\"This is something we as a nation can lead on,\" Driscoll said. \"And so under President Trump's leadership, we are moving fast at this problem.\"",
      "Driscoll said \"the problem with the drone fight is you need all sorts of layered defense,\" and he outlined that there are different authorities \"when you're doing it in your own homeland.\"",
      "\"A lot of this is a human problem of communication, command and control, and having a layered set of solutions that you can use for any given problem,\" he added.",
      "When it comes to regulating drones, Driscoll said he's \"pretty optimistic that we will be able to figure out a solution where we will know what is in the sky at every moment across our country, all at once.\"",
      "Driscoll said \"we are trying to design a system so that Americans are able to fly drones,\" along with commercial companies like Amazon. Citing the future of delivery in commercial drones, Driscoll said, \"we will just have to deconflict the skies, working with the FAA.\"",
      "\"What is amazing about our country is we are able to recognize where we need to innovate quickly,\" Driscoll said. \"What we're doing for drones, completely differently, I think than we have done as an arm in probably 50 or 60 years, is we're welcoming in American industry.\"",
      "On competition with China, which currently dominates commercial drone production, Driscoll said he expects to catch up.",
      "\"What we are going to do is we are going to invest in things like sensors and brushless motors and circuit boards and a lot of the components that are really hard for the private sector to get right now, the United States Army is going to build those on our bases and empower the private sector to purchase from us,\" he said. \"And so we will make drones. Our private partners will make drones, and we will catch up and surpass the Chinese incredibly quickly.\"",
      "After the 43-day government shutdown that resulted in $400 million in loans from USAA, Driscoll said it will take \"months and months\" for the military to get back to work on projects.",
      "\"This is part of the calcification of our system, that under President Trump, we are uniquely able to try to go after a lot of these things and actually get our army and their families living in better areas, and get our soldiers ready for the modern fight,\" he said. \"And the shutdown does not help.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who helped facilitate the deal to end the shutdown last week, said Sunday that lawmakers need to put the shutdown behind them as they look for consensus to address health care costs.",
      "\"We need to put the shutdown behind us, end the circular firing squad, and remember why we're in this situation,\" Shaheen said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Shaheen said \"we're in this situation because Donald Trump and Speaker Johnson and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate refused to address the cost of health care,\" adding that lawmakers need to reach consensus to get a bipartisan bill to address health care costs out of Congress.",
      "Democrats had sought an agreement to extend expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits in return for their votes to reopen the government. But on the 40th day of the shutdown, eight Senate Democrats, including Shaheen, broke ranks to reach a deal with Republicans to end the funding lapse, securing a promise to hold a vote next month on the tax credits, which help millions of Americans pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges.",
      "Now, Democrats have an opportunity, and a short timeline, to move forward with the legislation of their choice to address the expiring tax credits. Exactly what that looks like, and whether it could find enough support to pass, remains to be seen.",
      "Shaheen said with the legislation, \"we ought to be able to agree on some changes, like capping the income of people who receive those premium tax credits,\" along with seeking to root out fraud and abuse within the program.",
      "\"So let's focus on what we can agree to,\" she said. \"Let's look at what we can get done in the timeframe we have, and recognize there is real urgency to get these premium tax credits extended.\"",
      "The New Hampshire Democrat, who worked with Republicans to come to the deal to end the shutdown, said Democrats need to work with their Republican colleagues to come up with a bill that can find support in both chambers. She said \"we've been talking to our Republicans, Sen. Cassidy, throughout the shutdown about what we might be able to agree to,\" along with House members on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation,\" said he's been in communication with the White House about a plan to bring down the cost of health care for Americans. But the plan takes a different approach, giving Americans money to help them offset high deductibles that are often a feature of the lower-cost policies under the ACA. The president has floated a similar idea.",
      "But Shaheen cast doubt on the plan, expressing urgency to address the health care costs in the short-term.",
      "\"We can work together, we can extend the credits, but we probably can't implement significant reforms that Sen. Cassidy was talking about in the time frame that we've got,\" Shaheen said. \"So we need to look both in the short term and in the long term for how we address the cost of health care.\"",

      "There's some relief that the government shutdown is over, but Democrats are more likely to say they're frustrated about the deal that ended it, and that their party compromised too much.",
      "By a wide margin, Americans say it was Republicans and President Trump who succeeded in getting more of what they wanted from the negotiations to end the shutdown.",
      "This survey recontacted Americans first interviewed in our early-November poll, while the shutdown was in effect.",
      "Today, most Democrats think their own party's congressional Democrats compromised too much. Most Republicans say their delegation's approach to compromise was about right.",
      "And perhaps as a result, rank-and-file Democrats tend to agree that Trump and congressional Republicans got more of what they wanted, more so than their own party.",
      "Among the wider public, more think the congressional Republicans didn't compromise enough than they think this of congressional Democrats.",
      "During the shutdown, most disapproved of how all the players were handling things at that time.",
      "That negativity remains when Americans are asked now, in retrospect, how each handled it.",
      "But disapproval for congressional Democrats, when asked how they handled it, is now a bit higher than for congressional Republicans and Donald Trump.",
      "That's driven in part by views among their own party, as well as some independents, more of whom had said they approved of Democrats' handling two weeks ago.",
      "There's a lot of negativity in sentiments expressed about the deal among Democrats \u2014 top picks are frustrated, dissatisfied and also pessimistic, in front of even relieved.",
      "Republicans, for their part, are more likely to say they're relieved and satisfied.",
      "Most rank-and-file Democrats did think the party's positions were worth a shutdown, which may help explain the frustration they feel.",
      "So what now? The shutdown did seem to have the effect of highlighting health care issues: Most say that was at least included among the issues debated. Today, two-thirds think that health insurance premiums will increase in the coming months, now that the shutdown has ended. As government employees and air traffic controllers begin to get paid, people do think air travel will improve in the coming weeks.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey is based on a nationally representative sample of 1,288 U.S. adults who were recontacted November 13-14, 2024, after the government shutdown ended, following an initial survey conducted during the government shutdown October 29-31, 2025 using a nationally representative sample of 2,124 U.S. adults.\u00a0 The margin of error for the total sample in the recontact survey is \u00b13.3\u00a0 points.",

    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breast-cancer-birth-control-study-science/",
    "published": "Sat, 15 Nov 2025 07:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The study sought to answer questions about how breast cancer risk differs by type of hormonal contraceptive. Doctors say the results won't change how they counsel patients.",
    "story": [
      "As misinformation about women's health spreads faster than ever, doctors say new research on the risks of hormonal birth control underscores the challenge of communicating nuance in the social media age.",
      "The massive study, which was conducted in Sweden and tracked more than two million teenage girls and women under age 50 for more than a decade, found that hormonal contraception remains safe overall, but also found small differences in breast cancer risk based on the hormones used in the formulation. In addition, the researchers observed a small, short-term rise in breast cancer diagnoses among current or recent users. Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a 2017 Danish registry analysis and a 2023 meta-analysis.",
      "It was published online Oct. 30 in JAMA Oncology.",
      "Doctors say these study results won't change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.",
      "Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this can easily be taken out of context online and be reduced to a single alarming number.",
      "Case in point: The study reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24% higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn't. But because breast cancer is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year \u2014 about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.",
      "Co-authors \u00c5sa Johansson and Dr. Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at Uppsala University, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.",
      "Rachel Fey \u2014 interim co-CEO of Power to Decide, a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods \u2014 said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media. \"I get really angry at this because it's designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways,\" she said. \"It's really frustrating \u2026 especially when it's given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they're talking about providing that context.\"",
      "The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel \u2014 found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea \u2014 but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo\u2011Provera.",
      "How to interpret the findings",
      "Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumors, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.",
      "\"A substantial proportion of the 'cases' would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer,\" said Lina S. M\u00f8rch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. M\u00f8rch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.",
      "The doctor-patient conversation",
      "Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasize that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: that hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman's needs and values.",
      "Dr. Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won't change how she talks to her patients.",
      "\"When counseling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what's important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable),\" White wrote in an email. \"Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counseling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods.\"",
      "Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.",
      "Dr. Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, \"For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired,\" referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.",
      "Dr. Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn't change their advice yet.",
      "Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. \"It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data,\" they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.",
      "Keeping the risk in perspective",
      "Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. M\u00f8rch noted that even small risks are worth discussing but said decisions should be guided by women's \"values and preferences.\"",
      "White said it's important to see the big picture. \"The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85% for people who do not use contraception\u2014so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy,\" she wrote.",

    "story": [
      "What is thought to be the world's largest-known spider's web, housing tens of thousands of arachnids, has been discovered in a cave on the Albanian-Greek border.",
      "After researchers published their findings of two different spider species peacefully cohabiting in a giant colony nestled in a pitch-black, sulfur-rich cave, evolutionary biologist Lena Grinsted likened the \"extremely rare\" occurrence to humans living in an apartment block.",
      "\"When I saw this study, I was very excited because \u2026 group living is really rare in spiders,\" Grinsted, a senior lecturer at the U.K.'s University of Portsmouth, told The Associated Press. \"The fact that there was this massive colony of spiders living in a place that nobody had really noticed before \u2014 I find extremely exciting.\"",
      "The results of the study, published last month in the journal Subterranean Biology, spread rapidly online due to the striking images of the giant 1,140-square-foot spider's web, a carpet-thick sprawl stretching along a narrow passage wall inside Sulfur Cave, which extends into Albania from its entrance in Greece.",
      "This arachnophobe's worst nightmare was quickly labelled the \"world's largest spiderweb.\"",
      "But the most surprising thing about the spider colony \u2014 which boasts an estimated 110,000 spiders \u2014 had less to do with its size and more to do with what scientists found inside the huge mass of funnel-shaped webs.",
      "Two different spider species \u2014 about 69,000 Tegenaria domestica, or common house spider, and 42,000 Prinerigone vagans \u2014 were living side by side and thriving. The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
      "\"So often if you have spiders in close vicinity, they will fight and end up eating each other,\" said Grinsted, who was not part of the cave study but has extensively researched spiders. \"We can sometimes see that if there's an abundance of food that they sort of become a bit less aggressive.\"",
      "In addition to spiders, the terrestrial fauna in the cave include centipedes, terrestrial isopods, scorpions and beetles, the researchers said.",
      "\"In the stream passage located close to the cave entrance, a dense swarm of adult chironomid flies fills the air in the immediate vicinity of the sulfidic stream, and a large portion of the cave wall is covered by a massive colonial spider web,\" the study's authors write.",
      "Abundant food source",
      "Scientists are keen to understand how and why the two species came to coexist peacefully in a \"permanently dark zone\" about 160 feet from the entrance of the cave, carved out by the waters of the Sarandaporo River to form the Vromoner Canyon. (The study's authors note that Vromoner means \"smelly water\" in Greek.)",
      "Part of the answer, the research suggests, may lie in the combination of the estimated 2.4 million midge flies that buzz around the spider colony \u2014 an \"unusually dense swarm\" that provides a constant food source in an otherwise predator-scarce environment. The scientists also speculate that the friendly living arrangement could be a result of darkness impairing the spiders' vision.",
      "However, Grinsted says it is more likely that the larger spiders evolved or simply grew accustomed to responding to vibratory cues when the small flies land on their silken web \u2014 and maybe don't attack otherwise.",
      "\"Spiders, in general, are not particularly good at seeing stuff ... and that includes these two species,\" she said. She added that the two species might cooperate \"to some extent in building the web \u2026 but I think it's highly unlikely that they cooperate in anything else like prey capture, in brood care, or looking after each other's babies.\"",
      "Grinsted draws parallels between the cohabiting spiders and how humans tend to coexist in apartment blocks.",
      "\"You're very happy to share the stairs, the lift,\" she said. \"But if anybody comes into your living room and you haven't invited them, you'll be aggressive towards them.\"",
      "She added that while many spiders are \"typically solitary, very aggressive\" toward other critters, the cohabitation of two species is \"relatively common\" once spiders have evolved the ability to live in groups.",
      "\"But again, because these two species have never been found to live together and never been found to live in groups, it makes it particularly exciting,\" she said.",
      "\"The web is dense \u2014 like a blanket\"",
      "Blerina Vrenozi, a biologist and zoologist at the University of Tirana, in Albania, who co-authored the research paper, told the AP that the expeditions this year helped understand \"how this mystery existed in there.\"",
      "\"The DNA is interesting because they revealed that the species which live inside the cave is different from the one which lives outside the cave,\" she said. \"So it's the same species, but different DNA.\"",
      "The cave colony's giant web was first observed in 2021 by a team of Czech speleologists led by Marek Audy. A year later, the Czech team expanded to include scientists from multiple universities, which led to the recently published scientific paper.",
      "\"The web is dense; it's more like a blanket, and when there's danger, the female crawls back and hides, and no creature of a higher order can dig her out of there,\" Audy said. \"Spiders in the cave lay about a third of the eggs compared to spiders that live outdoors. Because it's certain that they will raise their offspring there \u2026 so they can afford to lay fewer eggs.\"",
      "Audy added that the cave, which is also home to large bat colonies, also thrive on the abundance of midges inside the humid, dark space. \"They are constantly having a party there, both the spiders and the bats,\" he said.",
      "Seemingly ideal environment",
      "The study noted that the methodology used might \"slightly overestimate\" the total population count of spiders in the colony, as some funnel webs may be abandoned or unoccupied. However, other experts agree that the team's exciting new research could offer broader evolutionary clues and deserves deeper study.",
      "Sara Goodacre, professor of evolutionary biology and genetics at the School of Life Sciences, at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, says these kinds of research projects help pave the way for more studies that could prove \"fundamental to our understanding of what forces shape the world around us \u2014 spidery or not.\"",
      "\"Natural selection will favor the 'best' strategies \u2026 the 'winning strategy,' whatever this is,\" she said. \"My guess is that the benefits of being part of this community far outweigh the costs.\"",
      "She added that if the dynamics in the seemingly ideal environment of abundant food and relative safety were to change, \"then 'freeloading' will emerge and it will all break down.\"",
      "The politics of coexistence will hopefully not prove trickier above ground. Audy said that Albania has already asked which side the newly famous spiders lie.",
      "\"From a conservation point of view, we did something interesting there and marked out a border,\" he said. \"I just looked into it \u2014 and the spider web is on the Greek side.\"",
      "The discovery of the massive web comes just months after Australian scientists discovered a new species of the deadly funnel-web spider that is bigger and more venomous than its relatives, nicknaming it \"Big Boy.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 03:10:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Sentinel-6B is the second of two satellites in a $1 billion program to monitor sea levels over a full decade.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched a joint NASA-European environmental research satellite early Monday, the second in an ongoing billion-dollar project to measure long-term changes in sea level, a key indicator of climate change.",
      "The first satellite, known as Sentinel-6 and named in honor of NASA climate researcher Michael Freilich, was launched in November 2020. The latest spacecraft, Sentinel-6B, was launched from California atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 12:21 a.m. EST.",
      "Both satellites are equipped with a sophisticated cloud-penetrating radar. By timing how long it takes beams to bounce back from the ocean 830 miles below, the Sentinel-6 satellites can track sea levels to an accuracy of about one inch while also measuring wave height and wind speeds.",
      "The project builds on earlier missions dating back to the early 1990s that have provided an uninterrupted stream of sea level data.",
      "That data indicates sea levels are slowly but surely rising, widely interpreted as evidence of global warming caused in large part by human industrial activity.",
      "But in keeping with recent Trump administration policies aimed at scaling back climate research and the interpretation of such data, NASA did not directly refer to \"climate change\" or \"global warming\" in a Sentinel-6B pre-launch briefing Saturday.",
      "In the press kit released by NASA for the first Sentinel 6 mission in 2020, the first item in a \"need to know list\" said the satellite would \"provide information that will help researchers understand how climate change is reshaping Earth's coastlines \u2014 and how fast this is happening.\"",
      "In the press kit for the Sentinel 6B mission launched Monday, NASA's first \"need to know\" item said simply that \"Sentinel-6B will contribute to a multi-decade dataset that is ... key to helping improve public safety, city planning and protecting commercial and defense interests.\"",
      "Karen St. Germain, director of NASA's Earth Science Division, did not directly mention climate change in the Saturday briefing, focusing instead on the practical importance of monitoring sea levels.",
      "\"Sentinel 6B is the latest in a line of missions stretching over three decades, keeping an uninterrupted watch over our planet's sea surface height, finding patterns and advancing our understanding of planet Earth,\" she said.",
      "She said the data provided by the Sentinel-6 satellites \"underpins navigation, search and rescue and industries like commercial fishing and shipping. These measurements form the basis for U.S. flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage sites and other assets along our shoreline.\"",
      "The data, she continued, will help scientists \"understand and predict coastal erosion and salt water encroachment into inland supplies of water that are used for agriculture, irrigation as well as municipal drinking water.\"",
      "Regardless of interpretation, the launch of Sentinel-6B went off without a hitch.",
      "After blasting off from launch complex 4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage powered the vehicle out of the dense lower atmosphere, separated and flew itself back to a landing pad at the California launch site.",
      "The upper stage then carried out two firings of its single engine before releasing the 2,600-pound Sentinel-6B into an 830-mile-high orbit tilted 66 degrees to the equator, the same orbit used by Sentinel-6A and earlier sea level-monitoring spacecraft.",
      "Taking 112 minutes to complete one orbit, the solar-powered satellite will fly over locations between 66 degrees north and south latitude, covering 90 percent of the world's oceans.",
      "Along with measuring sea levels, the new satellite will monitor temperature and humidity in the lower atmosphere as well as the higher-altitude stratosphere using an instrument that measures atmospheric effects on signals broadcast by navigation satellites.",
      "But the primary mission is monitoring Earth's changing sea levels.",
      "\"The dynamic balance that persisted before the industrial revolution has been upset by the almost instantaneous combustion of huge reserves of carbon as our society has developed,\" Craig Donlon, a European Space Agency project scientist, said before the first Sentinel-6 launch in 2020.",
      "\"We see evidence of this dramatic change in many different measurements ... but they all point the same direction: the Earth is warming. And the greatest indicator of this Earth system imbalance is sea level rise.\"",
      "The Sentinel-6 satellites are the result of a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "St. Germain said NASA's share of the cost for both Sentinel-6 satellites came to about $500 million. The Europeans contributed a similar amount.",

    "summary": "Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, plans to challenge SpaceX with the powerful, partially reusable New Glenn rocket.",
    "story": [
      "Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket Thursday, putting two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The centerpiece of Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos' space ambitions, the towering 321-foot-tall New Glenn rocket's seven methane-burning main engines ignited at 3:55 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the booster skyward atop 3.8 million pounds of thrust.",
      "The launch came three days late due to stormy weather on Earth and in space, where a powerful solar storm buffeted Earth's atmosphere with a torrent of high-energy radiation that could have caused electrical problems with the rocket or its payloads.",
      "The storm had abated by launch time Wednesday, and Blue Origin employees, looking on from viewing sites several miles from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad, cheered and applauded as the booster climbed skyward, followed moments later by the booming roar of its engines sweeping across the Space Coast.",
      "The New Glenn's maiden flight last January successfully boosted a  Blue Origin payload into orbit, but the reusable first stage failed in  its attempt to reach an offshore landing ship, named after Bezos'  mother, Jacklyn.",
      "The 188-foot-tall first stage launched Wednesday,  nicknamed \"Never Tell Me The Odds,\" featured a variety of upgrades to  improve performance. This time around, the big rocket flew itself to an  on-target touchdown, prompting more cheers and applause from Blue Origin  workers.",
      "Much like returning SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, the larger New Glenn booster will be hauled back to Port Canaveral and, depending on its condition, be refurbished and readied for use on an upcoming New Glenn flight.",
      "The second stage, meanwhile, pressed ahead, carrying out two firings of its twin engines to reach the planned Earth-escape trajectory. Thirty-three minutes after liftoff, the ESCAPADE satellites were released to fly on their own.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission. The acronym stands for Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers.",
      "The probes were built for UC Berkeley by Rocketlab under a NASA program intended to develop lower-cost, fast-track planetary missions.",
      "ESCAPADE cost $107.4 million, a bargain compared to the cost of more traditional, more sophisticated planetary spacecraft that can cost hundreds of millions to well over a billion dollars each.",
      "The ESCAPADE probes were originally expected to hitch a ride to Mars a few years ago with NASA's Psyche asteroid probe. But for a variety of reasons, the Mars satellites mission ultimately ended up on New Glenn's second flight.",
      "Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "To make Wednesday's New Glenn launch work in 2025, mission planners with Advanced Space LLC came up with an innovative flight plan, one that will take Blue and Gold longer to reach Mars but will enable more flexible trajectories for future missions.",
      "The probes were deployed on a trajectory that will carry them a million miles out, well past the moon's orbit, where they will loiter for the next 11 months before heading back toward Earth.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars.",
      "In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "\"We are using a very flexible ... approach where we go into a loiter orbit around Earth in order to sort of wait until Earth and Mars are lined up correctly in November of next year to go to Mars,\" said Robert Lillis, the principal investigator.",
      "\"This is an exciting, flexible way to get to Mars because in the future ... we could potentially queue up spacecraft using the approach that ESCAPADE is pioneering\" without having to wait for a planetary launch window to open, Lillis said.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",
      "Working in tandem, first in the same orbit at different distances from each other and then from different altitudes, Blue and Gold will measure how the solar wind and energetic electrons and protons from solar storms interact with the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Data from earlier Mars satellites showed the planet's atmosphere is constantly being stripped by those interactions, but exactly how that happens over time is not fully understood.",
      "\"We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,\" Lillis said. \"We know that atmospheric escape from Mars is a major driver for the evolution of the Martian climate. We know that Mars at least was episodically warm and wet for a couple billion years, but hasn't been so for about 2 billion years or so. And we think atmospheric escape is a major reason for that.\"",
      "Blue and Gold will provide what amounts to a stereo view of those processes.",
      "\"If you only have one spacecraft, you can either measure what the sun is throwing at Mars, the so-called space weather environment upstream of Mars, or you can measure the conditions close to Mars in its upper atmosphere, where the atmosphere is escaping,\" Lillis said.",
      "\"You can't be in two places at once. But we can, because we have two spacecraft to do this. So we can really get that cause-and-effect at the same time. We've never had that before, and that's really exciting,\" Lillis said.",

      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Thursday's stock market tumble \u2014 when high-flying AI stocks such as Nvidia and CoreWeave led the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to see its biggest drop in months \u2014 fueled further anxiety this week about another bubble.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",
      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

    "summary": "State-sponsored cybercriminals used Anthropic's tech to target tech companies, financial institutions and other organizations, AI company alleges.",
    "story": [
      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company shared its findings with CBS News but did not offer additional comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",
      "Chris Krebs, the former head of the federal government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS Mornings on Friday that this attack is a sign of what's to come.",

    "summary": "Google said the fake messages are part of a massive criminal network called \"Lighthouse\" that has stolen information through phishing and smishing scams.",
    "story": [
      "Google is filing a federal lawsuit against a network of foreign cybercriminals based in China that is accused of launching massive text-message phishing attacks, the tech giant told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",
      "DeLaine Prado said Google has filed what it calls a first-of-its-kind lawsuit under the RICO Act, which is typically used to take down organized crime rings.",
      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",
      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",
      "In an update on Nov. 13, Google said its request for a temporary restraining order \"was granted just hours after the complaint was filed, and the Lighthouse operation is now essentially dark.\"",
      "Kevin Gosschalk, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, said that while recovering lost money is a challenge, lawsuits like Google's could help disrupt scammers' operations.",
      "\"It has an impact on the ecosystem,\" Gosschalk told CBS News. He said that if there are three major players and you go after the big one and take it down, \"then the other two start second-guessing, 'Hey, should we be in this business, or should we get out of this business?'\"",
      "Google's move appears aimed as much at setting a legal precedent as at seeking punishment \u2014 testing whether a 1970s racketeering law can be applied to a 21st-century digital crime.",
      "Gosschalk said it will be very hard for Google to go after cybercriminals overseas since a lot of them also operate in countries like Cambodia, where there are limited extradition laws.",
      "\"But it does mean the individuals behind those things will not be able to travel to the U.S. in the future, so it does add extra risk,\" Gosschalk said.",
      "Users can avoid text scams by not clicking links or replying to unknown messages. On an iPhone, users can turn on \"Filter Unknown Senders\" and \"Filter Junk.\" On Android, enable Spam Protection and forward scam texts to 7726 (SPAM).",
      "Note that those filters can also catch legitimate messages from numbers that are not in the phone's contact list, so be sure to check the unknown senders or spam folder once in a while.",

      "President Trump has a warm and elaborate welcome planned for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, at the White House Tuesday, signaling his administration's close ties to the Saudi kingdom as the president aims to lock in major business and national security deals.",
      "Ahead of bin Salman's arrival, the president told reporters Monday that the U.S. would sell F-35 fighter jets to the Saudis.",
      "The White House has prepared an arrival ceremony laden with fanfare for the crown prince, complete with cannons and U.S. and Saudi flags draped on buildings. The U.S. military will conduct an aircraft flyover over the White House during MBS' arrival.",
      "There will also be a black-tie dinner with bin Salman. There are 120 invited guests, according to a person familiar with the planning, and 30 will be from the Saudi delegation. Although it's not a state dinner, it is the first formal dinner hosted by Mr. Trump in his second term to honor a nation's leader. Bin Salman's father, Salman bin Abdulaziz is technically the head of state of the kingdom, but he delegated his duties as ruler to MBS in 2017.",
      "\"We're more than meeting,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of the visit. \"We're honoring Saudi Arabia.\"",
      "A senior administration official said the president will be making announcements regarding Saudi investment in U.S. AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy, defense sales and the fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge, which was announced during the president's trip to Saudi Arabia in May.",
      "The White House visit is also expected to include an Oval Office meeting and lunch, similar to meetings the president has held with other world leaders in recent weeks.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly called the trip \"an official working visit\" in a statement and said, \"Americans can expect more good deals for our country spanning technology, manufacturing, critical minerals, defense, and more.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is also planning to attend a Saudi business summit in Washington, D.C., Wednesday. An invitation previously obtained by CBS News said the event at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts will be co-hosted by the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia and the U.S.-Saudi Business Council.",
      "Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and former top White House adviser Jared Kushner have fostered close relationships with the Saudis and the crown prince in particular, viewing them as critical partners for both security and business in a turbulent Middle East. The president said the Abraham Accords \u2014 an agreement from his first term that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel, Bahrain and the UAE\u00a0 \u2014 would be a big topic of discussion during the visit.",
      "\"The Abraham Accords will be a part we're going to be discussing,\" Mr. Trump said over the weekend. \"I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly. We've had tremendous interest in the Abraham Accords since we put Iran out of business.\"",
      "Mr. Trump recently told \"60 Minutes\" contributing correspondent Norah O'Donnell that he thought bin Salman would join the agreement, although the Saudis have indicated that would not happen without a path to Palestinian statehood.",
      "The Trumps also have extensive and longheld personal business ties in Saudi Arabia. Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea.",
      "Eric Trump, the president's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told Reuters that the Trump Organization also has plans for a Trump-branded property in Riyadh.",
      "And Kushner started a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received a reported $2 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund controlled by bin Salman.",
      "The trip to the White House visit is the crown prince's first U.S. visit since Washington Post journalist and human rights activist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in 2018 in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul by members of the Saudi government. The president has smoothed over relations with the Saudis since the CIA assessed about a month after Khashoggi's killing that the crown prince had ordered it. Bin Salman has denied anyinvolvement, but he told O'Donnell in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview that he took responsibility for Khashoggi's death.",
      "\"I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government,\" he told O'Donnell.",
      "The Biden administration later released the Trump-era intelligence report concluding the crown prince \"approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not seek to punish bin Salman personally during his first administration and said he viewed Saudi Arabia as a \"great ally,\" noting the economic ties between the U.S. and the Saudis. The Trump administration did sanction 19 Saudi nationals over the killing.",
      "\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Mr. Trump posted on social media in November 2018.",
      "\"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\"",
      "Human rights advocates are dismayed about the treatment bin Salman is expected to receive in Washington, not only because of Khashoggi's murder, but also because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record under bin Salman.",
      "\"We know President Trump won't ask MBS to reveal where Jamal's remains are so his family can finally bury him,\" said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now, an organization Khashoggi founded months before he was killed. \"But the least he can do \u2014 the absolute minimum \u2014 is publicly press MBS to release the dozens of activists, writers and reformers languishing in Saudi prisons for the 'crime' of speaking freely.\"",
      "Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director at DAWN, called bin Salman's journey from castigation over Khashoggi's murder to a high-profile White House welcome an \"extraordinary political feat.\" And that's not just because of Mr. Trump's gestures of friendship toward the crown prince.

    "summary": "An Indiana prosecutor has charged a homeowner who shot and killed a house cleaner earlier this month, when she showed up at his property by mistake.",
    "story": [
      "An Indiana homeowner is being charged with a felony after he\u00a0shot and killed a house cleaner on his front porch earlier this month. Police said the woman and her husband had mistakenly shown up to the property in Whitestown, about 20 miles outside of Indianapolis, thinking it was a different address. Neither appeared to enter the residence, according to police.",
      "The homeowner, Curt Andersen, faces one count of voluntary manslaughter, Boone County Prosecutor Kent Eastwood announced at a news conference Monday. Eastwood said his office decided to bring the charge, a Level 2 felony, after determining that shooting did not meet the requirements for protection under Indiana's \"stand your ground law\" \u2014 a self-defense statute that allows individuals to use deadly force in situations where they believe doing so is necessary in order to prevent their own serious bodily injury.",
      "\"It is vitally important for the citizens of Boone County to understand that our decision today in no way should be interpreted as a challenge to Indiana 'stand your ground' law, or a person's right to self-defense,\" said Eastwood. \"Based upon the particular evidence and circumstances of this case, we have determined that Curt Andersen's actions do not fall within the legal protections provided by the Indiana 'stand your ground' law.\"",
      "Eastwood identified the woman as Maria Florinda Rios Perez de Velazquez. She and her husband, Mauricio Velazquez, had gone to the home as part of a cleaning crew,\u00a0CBS affiliate WTTV\u00a0reported. They share four children, according to the station.",
      "An attorney for the family, Alex J. Limontes, said they were encouraged to see charges filed in connection with her \"tragic and preventable death.\"",
      "\"This is an important step towards accountability, truth and justice. And it's a step that Maria's family deserves. On the morning Maria was killed, she was simply arriving to clean a home. She was doing her job, supporting her family and contributing to her community,\" Limones said at a news conference.",
      "Before 7 a.m. on the morning of Nov. 5, officers with the Whitestown Metropolitan Police Department responded to a report of a possible break-in at a subdivision in the area, the department said in a\u00a0statement. When they arrived at the scene, the officers found Perez deceased on the front porch of the residence after suffering a gunshot wound. Velazquez was not harmed.",
      "Velazquez later told WTTV that the gunshot came from inside the home and had been fired through the door. A bullet hole could be seen in the door in the shooting's aftermath, the station reported.",
      "\"They should've called the police first instead of just shooting out of nowhere like that,\" Velazquez told WTTV through an interpreter.",
      "Whitestown police said the department was \"committed to conducting a thorough and impartial investigation\" into what happened and would be \"interviewing all individuals involved\" as crime scene investigators were \"meticulously collecting and analyzing all relevant evidence to understand the full scope of what occurred.\"",
      "The department had said it was working closely with the Boone County Prosecutor's Office as the investigation got underway.",
      "\"We understand that incidents like this can cause concern and speculation,\" said Whitestown police. \"We respectfully ask the public to place their trust in the investigative process and refrain from sharing unverified information. These cases are often complex and require time to fully understand. Misinformation can be harmful to those involved and to the integrity of the investigation.\"",
      "Indiana is one of 31 states with a \"stand your ground law,\" but experts say that the circumstances surrounding the implementation have to be reasonable. In 2023, a Black teenager in Missouri was shot and killed when he rang the wrong doorbell; the shooter later pleaded guilty. That same year in upstate New York, a man was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for shooting and killing a woman who inadvertently pulled into his rural driveway.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 19:22:45 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal magistrate judge wrote that there is a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in the case involving former FBI Director James Comey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal magistrate judge on Monday ordered federal prosecutors to turn over all grand jury material to former FBI Director James Comey's defense team, harshly criticizing the Justice Department for a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in its handling of the case against the ex-FBI chief.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick allowed Comey's legal team to get access to all grand jury materials, including transcripts and evidence presented to the grand jury that indicted Comey on two charges relating to past testimony to Congress. Fitzpatrick also ordered the Justice Department to turn over the complete audio recordings of the proceedings to Comey's legal team.",
      "Comey has pleaded not guilty to both counts, which stem from alleged misstatements he made to the Senate Judiciary Committee during a September 2020 hearing. The former FBI director was indicted just days before the statute of limitations on those offenses ran out.",
      "The judge recognized the magnitude of his decision to allow Comey's lawyers access to the grand jury material, which is typically kept secret, writing in a scathing 24-page decision that he is granting an \"extraordinary remedy\" to fully protect Comey's legal rights. Fitzpatrick said such a step is warranted because of \"the prospect that government misconduct may have tainted the grand jury proceedings.\"",
      "\"The Court recognizes that the relief sought by the defense is rarely granted,\" he wrote. \"However, the record points to a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps, missteps that led an FBI agent and a prosecutor to potentially undermine the integrity of the grand jury proceeding.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick wrote that \"procedural and substantive irregularities that occurred before the grand jury, and the manner in which evidence presented to the grand jury was collected and used, may rise to the level of government misconduct resulting in prejudice to Mr. Comey.\"",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is prosecuting Comey, did not immediately return a request for comment. The Justice Department had no comment. Prosecutors asked the district court to freeze Fitzpatrick's order directing them to turn over the grand jury materials to Comey's defense team in order to file objections.",
      "\"The government's position is that disclosure of grand jury materials is not warranted under the facts presented to the Magistrate Judge. Indeed, the government believes the Magistrate Judge may have misinterpreted some facts he found when issuing the latest order to release the grand jury materials to the defendant,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "Fitzpatrick's role in the case stems from the government's request to implement a filter protocol to govern its handling and the disclosure of potentially privileged material that was seized in 2019 and 2020 as part of a separate investigation and was never returned. Comey's team opposed the move and argued that the information the government wanted to review was improperly retained after the end of that earlier investigation and improperly used in the probe involving Comey.",
      "The ex-FBI director is seeking access to the grand-jury material as part of a bid to have the indictment dismissed because of alleged irregularities in those proceedings.",
      "At a hearing earlier this month, Fitzpatrick admonished\u00a0the Justice Department for what he said is its posture to \"indict first, investigate second.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick himself reviewed the grand jury materials and wrote in his decision that he identified two statements Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, made to the grand jurors that \"on their face appear to be fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the integrity of the grand jury process.\"",
      "Portions of the decision \u2014 including Halligan's comments \u2014 are redacted, but Fitzpatrick said both were made in response to questions from grand jurors and are \"directly related to communications involving Comey.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said one statement Halligan made to the grand jury \"suggests\" that Comey does not have a constitutional right to not testify at trial. The second remark from Halligan suggested that the grand jury \"did not have to rely on only the record before them\" and that there was \"more evidence \u2014 perhaps better evidence\" that the Justice Department had that would be used at trial, the judge said.",
      "The material at issue was seized by the FBI in 2019 and 2020 in response to court-authorized search warrants for accounts and devices belonging to Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University who is a friend of Comey. Richman worked as a special government employee at the FBI during Comey's tenure as director, and was his private attorney as of May 2017, when Mr. Trump fired Comey during his first term.",
      "Fitzpatrick said the materials seized from Richman were the \"cornerstone\" of Halligan's presentation to the grand jury that voted to indict Comey, even though they had been retrieved five years earlier as part of the separate investigation that has since been closed.",
      "The government also appears to have access to information it seized from Richman that was outside the scope of the search warrants, the judge said, even though agents had been instructed to seal any information that did not fall within the contours of the warrants.",
      "\"The government appears to have conflated its obligation to protect privileged information \u2013 an obligation it approached casually at best in this case \u2013 with its duty to seize only those materials authorized by the Court,\" he wrote. \"This cavalier attitude towards a basic tenet of the Fourth Amendment and multiple court orders left the government unchecked to rummage through all of the information seized from Mr. Richman, and apparently, in the government's eyes, to do so again anytime they chose.\"",
      "While the investigation involving Richman was closed in September 2021 and no charges were filed, the bureau \"chose to rummage through\" the seized material again this summer, when the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia began a criminal investigation into Comey, the judge said.",
      "Fitzpatrick wrote that despite the investigation into Comey starting this year, \"inexplicably, the government elected not to seek a new warrant for the 2025 search,\" of Richman's devices, \"even though the 2025 investigation was focused on a different person, was exploring a fundamentally different legal theory, and was predicated on an entirely different set of criminal offenses.\"",
      "If the Justice Department had sought new warrants, Fitzpatrick wrote it likely would have resulted in \"a delay the investigative team could not afford given that the statute of limitations would expire in a mere 18 days.\" Additionally, the judge said the parameters of a 2025 search would likely have been narrower in scope than the original warrants authorized for Richman's devices and accounts.",
      "The rush to prosecute Comey over his testimony in the face of the statute of limitations running out also resulted in the appointment of one of Mr. Trump's former aides and personal attorneys, Halligan, to lead the federal prosecutor's office in the Eastern District of Virginia. Both Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was also indicted under Halligan's supervision, are challenging her appointment as unconstitutional.",
      "James was indicted on charges of bank fraud last month and pleaded not guilty.",
      "Halligan appeared before the grand jury on Sept. 25, but Fitzpatrick said that same day, before her presentation, an unidentified FBI agent alerted the lead case agent and a lawyer with the FBI's Office of General Counsel that evidence obtained during the investigation into Comey may have been subject to attorney-client privilege or constitute attorney-client confidential information.",
      "But instead of removing himself from the investigative team until any potential issues were resolved, the judge said the lead case agent appeared before the grand jury \"undeterred\" and testified in support of bringing charges against Comey. That federal agent was the only person to testify before the grand jury.",
      "\"The government's decision to allow an agent who was exposed to potentially privileged information to testify before a grand jury is highly irregular and a radical departure from past DOJ practice,\" Fitzpatrick wrote.",
      "Fitzpatrick's findings Monday are among numerous legal threads that have imperiled the Comey prosecution.",
      "Last week, a South Carolina federal judge heard arguments from both Comey's and James' legal teams on the legality of Halligan's appointment to lead the Eastern District of Virginia, with both requesting the judge dismiss the indictments against them because Halligan's appointment was unlawful. The judge overseeing that argument said she will have a ruling by next week.",
      "Meanwhile, Comey's attorneys will be back in court Wednesday, where they will argue that the indictment against Comey was \"vindictive and selective\" and should separately be dismissed on those grounds.",

    "summary": "Many fans of Taylor Swift showed parasocial relationships with the pop star after her engagement to Travis Kelce.",
    "story": [
      "If you felt a personal connection with a celebrity this year, you likely weren't alone.",
      "That feeling led Cambridge Dictionary to select \"parasocial\" as its 2025 word of the year. Parasocial is defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",
      "It's an academic term that has only been around for about 70 years, but it has now become mainstream, said Colin McIntosh, the lexical program manager for Cambridge Dictionary.",
      "\"Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise,\" McIntosh said in a statement. \"The data reflects that, with the Cambridge Dictionary website seeing spikes in lookups for 'parasocial.'\"",
      "A recent example of this happened when pop star Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce announced their engagement. Many fans who have been captivated by Swift's lyrics for years celebrated the moment despite not actually knowing her or Kelce.",
      "But parasocial relationships can become problematic, Simone Schnall, a professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, said.",
      "\"We've entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers,\" Schnall said. \"This leads to a sense that people 'know' those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. Yet it's completely one sided.\"",
      "The trend is also evolving to include artificial intelligence.",
      "\"Parasocial trends take on a new dimension as many people treat AI tools like ChatGPT as 'friends,' offering positive affirmations, or as a proxy for therapy. This is an illusion of a relationship and group think, and we know young people can be susceptible for this,\" Schnall said.",
      "Cambridge Dictionary's announcement follows Dictionary.com naming \"67\"\u00a0as its 2025 word of the year.",

    "summary": "Joseph Emerson tried to shut down a commercial plane's engines midflight in 2023 while traveling off duty in the cockpit's jump seat.",
    "story": [
      "Joseph Emerson, the former Alaska Airlines pilot who tried to shut down a commercial plane's engines midflight in 2023 while traveling off duty in the cockpit's jump seat, was sentenced Monday in federal court  to time served and three years of supervised release.",
      "Emerson, of Pleasant Hill, California, had pleaded guilty to the single charge of interfering with a flight crew in a September plea deal.",
      "Without the deal, Emerson had faced a potential maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Instead, prosecutors recommended a year behind bars followed by three years of supervised release. Emerson asked for time served and probation.",
      "Emerson told CBS News earlier this year he felt a sense of \"all-out panic and fear\" in the cockpit. He said he had been grieving the death of his best friend, leading him to turn to alcohol and the recreational drug known as \"magic mushrooms,\" which he said he tried two days before the flight.",
      "His attorneys said Emerson had hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, which made the effects of the psychedelic drug last for days instead of hours. U.S. District Judge Amy Baggio said the longer-lasting effects were a unique danger that was at the heart of the case.",
      "\"Pilots are not perfect,\" Baggio said before announcing her sentence. \"They are human. There is no such thing as a perfect pilot. They are people and all people need help sometimes.\"",
      "Emerson said in court that he saw mental health professionals while in custody and that he regretted the harm he caused.",
      "Emerson had previously pleaded no contest to state charges of endangering an aircraft and 83 counts of endangering another person. For those charges, he was sentenced to five years of probation and 50 days in jail, but he was credited for time served.",
      "Monday's sentence comes over two years after a chaotic scene erupted in the cockpit of a flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco on Horizon Air, which is affiliated with Alaska Airlines.",
      "According to prosecutors in Oregon, Emerson tossed a pilot headset across the cockpit and said, \"I'm not OK.\" He then pulled on the handles that cut fuel from the plane's engines in case of a fire, but he wasn't able to get the handles all the way down before the pilots grabbed him. After Emerson left the cockpit, the pilots landed at Portland International Airport, where he was taken into custody.",
      "In the cockpit, he said he didn't realize the consequences of his actions.",
      "\"I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life,\" Emerson told CBS News.",
      "In the interview, Emerson said he takes full responsibility for what happened.",
      "\"I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane,\" the onetime airline captain said. \"I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:18:14 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Nov. 9 said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a\u00a0Truth Social post last week. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later\u00a0told Fox News that the rebates would likely be given to families making \"less than, say, $100,000.\"\u00a0 That threshold is still in discussion, he added.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "Speaking from the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said his administration plans on issuing dividends from tariffs \"probably in the middle of next year.\"\u00a0He said \"thousands of dollars\" would go to \"moderate income, middle income\" Americans, adding that his administration has taken in \"tremendous amounts of money\" from tariffs.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "Bessent on Nov. 9 told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending new tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

      "An attorney for a man charged with killing four members of the same family told a judge on Monday he plans to request that a jury from outside the county hear the case, which set a swath of rural Tennessee on edge as the man eluded authorities for a week after the shootings.",
      "Austin Robert Drummond pleaded not guilty in his first court appearance since he was indicted on charges including first-degree murder and aggravated kidnapping in the July 29 shootings in Lake County, in rural northwest Tennessee. He was also charged with weapons offenses.",
      "Prosecutors have said they plan to seek the death penalty if Drummond is convicted of first-degree murder at trial.",
      "During the brief hearing, Drummond's attorney, Bryan Huffman, told Circuit Court Judge Mark Hayes that he intends to file a motion for a change of venue. Such motions can be entered in cases where pretrial publicity is high and lawyers believe that an unbiased jury cannot be selected. During the weeklong manhunt for Drummond, several people were arrested and accused of helping him after the killings.",
      "Drummond appeared in court wearing orange jail clothing and a protective vest, with shackles on his wrists and ankles.",
      "A grand jury indicted Drummond on Nov. 10. Drummond had also pleaded not guilty in a lower court before a judge ruled there was enough evidence for his case to proceed to the grand jury. Drummond is accused of the deaths of the parents, grandmother and uncle of an infant found abandoned in a home's front yard. A trial date has not been set.",
      "An intense search for Drummond ended on Aug. 5 in Jackson, about 70 miles southeast of the location of the killings in Tiptonville. Jackson Police Chief Thom Corley said Drummond was staying in a vacant building at the time of his arrest. Drummond was unarmed, but authorities said several guns were recovered. It was unclear if they were used in the killings.",
      "An FBI agent testified at a hearing in September that data from a cellphone used by Drummond showed he was in the vicinity of a wooded area where the bodies were found with gunshot wounds and covered by tarpaulins.",
      "But Huffman argued there was no evidence presented at the hearing that showed Drummond actually shot any of the victims.",
      "On the day of the shootings, officers responded to a call of an infant in a car seat being dropped off at a \"random individual's front yard\" roughly 40 miles from Tiptonville, the Dyer County Sheriff's Office has said.",
      "Then, investigators in neighboring Lake County reported four people had been found dead from gunshot wounds in Tiptonville. They were identified as the baby's parents, James M. Wilson, 21, and Adrianna Williams, 20; Williams' brother, Braydon Williams, 15; and their mother, Cortney Rose, 38. Drummond's girlfriend is Rose's sister, Huffman said.",
      "Dyer County Sheriff Jeff Box told reporters at the time of Drummond's arrest that the baby was \"safe, healthy and being well taken care of.\"",
      "In all, five people have been charged with being accessories after the fact in the case.",
      "Drummond has served prison time for robbing a convenience store and threatening to go after jurors. He was also charged with the attempted murder of a prison guard while behind bars, and he was out on bond at the time of the killings, District Attorney Danny Goodman has said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-retirement-age-2026-change-66-67-increase/",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:27:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age is changing next year, affecting when the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers can collect 100% of their benefits.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security's so-called \"full retirement age\" \u2014 the age when people can start collecting all of their earned benefits \u2014 is about to hit a new threshold, a change that will affect Americans born in 1960 or later.",
      "The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security is calculated using a worker's birth year, while their monthly benefits are based on the number of years they've worked and their income over that period. People may claim Social Security as early as age 62, but doing so permanently reduces their monthly benefit by about 30% compared with waiting until hitting their FRA.",
      "Starting in 2026, Social Security's full retirement age is set to make its final scheduled increase, marking the last step-up in age enacted under a\u00a01983 congressional reform\u00a0designed to shore up the program's finances. Before that overhaul, people could claim their FRA benefits at 65, but the law gradually pushed that age higher, culminating in the change that takes effect in 2026.",
      "Since 2021, the FRA has been rising by two months each year. It now stands at 66 years and 10 months for people born in 1959. Next year brings the final step in that schedule, when the FRA will reach 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later.",
      "With the FRA hitting 67, people born in 1960 won't qualify for their full benefits until 2027, rather than 2026. (You can check your own full-benefit age by entering your birthdate into this Social Security calculator.)",
      "The increase in the FRA will first impact the youngest baby boomers, or those born between 1960-1964, followed by Generation X, which spans 1965 to 1980. The change comes as many workers report feeling financially unprepared for retirement, with only about four in 10 Americans saying they're on track to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement,\u00a0according\u00a0to recent research from Vanguard.",
      "\"Raising the retirement age is an effective cut in lifetime benefits for younger baby boomers, members of Gen X and all the generations after,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the advocacy group National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, in an email to CBS News.",
      "While the increase in the full retirement age shouldn't come as a surprise given it was enacted 43 years ago, it doesn't guarantee older workers will be any more prepared financially for retirement, he added.",
      "\"Having time to plan, however, does not mean they have been able to put aside more for retirement, considering the stagnation of real wages and the rising cost of college tuition, home prices and other key living expenses,\" Richtman said.",
      "Retirement expectations versus reality",
      "There's also a longstanding gap between the age at which people expect to stop working and their real-world experiences, which can add to the financial strain of funding retirement. Many Americans believe they'll retire at age 65, but the median retirement age in the U.S. is in fact 62.",
      "Nearly six in 10 retirees say they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned, according to research published last year by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. An October survey from the same group found that most middle-class retirees \u2014 people with annual household incomes between $50,000 and $199,999 \u2014 stopped working earlier than they envisioned because of employment issues, such as losing their jobs, or poor health.",
      "That gap between expectations and reality may explain recent research that found 44% of Americans said they plan to claim Social Security before they\u00a0reach their full retirement age, which would result in lower monthly benefits.",
      "Some Americans also flle for Social Security before reaching their FRA out of a belief it makes more sense to bank more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower monthly amount.",
      "Transamerica also found that nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore the conventional financial advice of\u00a0waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, which locks in a 24% boost to a retiree's FRA payments.",
      "In the meantime, younger boomers and Gen Xers will have to hold off a little longer to claim their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"These younger cohorts will have to try their best to plan for retirement, knowing that they cannot collect full benefits until 67,\" Richtman added.",

    "summary": "A federal jury about to hear the drug-trafficking case against former heavyweight boxer Goran Gogic was abruptly dismissed after three men were charged with trying to bribe a juror with up to $100,000 to exonerate Gogic.",
    "story": [
      "Three men were arrested Monday for allegedly offering to pay $100,000 in cash to a juror at the Brooklyn drug trial of former heavyweight boxer Goran Gogic, leading a federal judge to abruptly dismiss the jury as it was about to hear opening statements.",
      "An anonymous jury will be chosen when Gogic's trial resumes after a 30-day break, said John Marzulli, a spokesperson for federal prosecutors in Brooklyn. Judge Joan Azrack scheduled a Dec. 17 conference.",
      "Gogic, of Montenegro, was set to stand trial for allegedly conspiring to smuggle 20 tons of cocaine to Europe from Colombia through U.S. ports using commercial cargo ships. He has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Three individuals were arrested after they approached a juror and offered to pay $100,000 to return a not guilty verdict, according to a transcript of the proceeding, Assistant U.S. Attorney Francisco Navarro told Azrack.",
      "The individuals may have obtained a copy of the jury list or jury information from \"individuals connected to this trial,\" the prosecutor said.",
      "Defense attorney Joseph Corozzo informed the judge that he told Gogic the trial would not proceed on Monday.",
      "Law enforcement officials have described Gogic as a \"major drug trafficker\" and said he operated on a \"mammoth scale.\"",
      "A former heavyweight boxer, Gogic fought professionally in Germany from 2001 to 2012, compiling a 21-4-2 record, according to boxing website Sport & Note. He was listed as 6-foot-5 and weighed in at anywhere from 227 pounds to 250 pounds.",
      "In a criminal complaint in Brooklyn federal court, an FBI agent wrote that the bribery scheme unfolded between Thursday and Sunday.",
      "According to the court papers, one of the men charged in the plot \u2014 Mustafa Fteja \u2014 already knew a juror described in the complaint as \"John Doe #1\" and called him multiple times on his cellphone Thursday before the juror agreed to meet him in Staten Island.",
      "During the meeting, which took place Thursday, Fteja told the juror that associates in the Bronx were willing to pay him to return a not guilty verdict, the complaint said.",
      "Two days later, Fteja told the juror during a second meeting that they were willing to pay him between $50,000 and $100,000 to corrupt the trial, the complaint said.",
      "It was not immediately clear who will represent Fteja and two others accused in the alleged jury tampering scheme when they appear in court later Monday.",
      "According to the complaint, investigators secured several recorded conversations of the defendants planning the juror corruption plot as the men spoke in Albanian and English. The court papers contained some quotes from the recorded conversations.",
      "At his trial, Gogic is charged with violating and conspiring to violate the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act. If convicted, he faces a sentence of 10 years to life in prison.",
      "According to prosecutors, Gogic and his co-conspirators worked with the ships' crew members to smuggle cocaine in shipping containers, hoisting loads of the drug from speedboats that approached the cargo vessels along their route, including near ports in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.",
      "Three shipments were intercepted by U.S. law enforcement agents, prosecutors said, including 1,437 kilograms (3,168 pounds) of cocaine aboard the MSC Carlotta at the Port of New York and New Jersey in February 2019 and 17,956 kilograms (39,586 pounds) of cocaine \u2014 with a street value of over $1 billion \u2014 aboard the MSC Gayane at the Port of Philadelphia in June 2019.",

    "summary": "Looking to save a few bucks on your Thanksgiving meal? AI can help, while some retailers are offering low-cost bundles.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can save you money preparing that Thanksgiving Day feast.",
      "Just tell an AI chatbot such as ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft Co-Pilot how many guests you're expecting, provide information on any dietary restrictions and outline your budget. The tools will help compare prices at different stores, and can even offer step-by-step instructions on how to prepare a Thanksgiving meal, as well as outline different recipes for various dishes.",
      "For example, Microsoft Co-Pilot lets users take photos of specific products and then ask questions about the product, like \"where can I find the best deal on this boxed stuffing?\" or \"how many boxes of this stuffing will I need to feed 10 people?\" The chatbot will offer suggestions based on those prompts, help shoppers buy the appropriate amount of ingredients and stay on budget by pointing to any cheaper options at local stores.",
      "Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst who goes by \"The SupermarketGuru,\" said smart shoppers can feed guests this holiday season for under $6 a person.",
      "AI is one tool consumers can use to ensure they're getting the best deals and to keep their holiday budgets under control. This year, shoppers can expect to spend roughly $80 to $95 \u2014 or $8 to $9.50 per person \u2014 preparing Thanksgiving dinner, according to a recent Wells Fargo analysis.",
      "That's about 2% to 3% less this year compared with Turkey Day costs in 2024, the bank found. Consumers are catching a break on foods such as bread, butter, eggs and wine, while the cost of staples such as potatoes, milk and some vegetables has remained flat or risen only modestly, according to the CBS News price tracker.",
      "As for the star ingredient, turkey, wholesale prices have jumped about 40% since last year, from 94 cents a pound to $1.32, according to the Department of Agriculture. However, wholesale costs don't always mean higher store prices. Wells Fargo found that retail prices for turkey are down 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Retailers are also making it easier for shoppers to save money and time by offering budget-friendly Thanksgiving dinner packages. Target offers a dinner option that serves four people for $20, while Amazon provides a similar package that feeds five for $25. Each bundle includes a turkey, along with ingredients for classic sides such as stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy and bread.",
      "For larger gatherings, Walmart and ALDI also have $40 meal baskets designed to serve up to 10 people.",
      "Tech can also help consumers find the best deals at supermarkets in their area. The Flipp app compiles digital ads from more than a thousand retailers and lets users browse weekly flyers, compare prices across stores and create shopping lists.",

    "summary": "The percentage of Americans just scraping by financially is rising as wage growth slows and inflation flares, Bank of America finds.",
    "story": [
      "A growing share of lower-income Americans are struggling to get by financially as their wages fail to keep up with inflation, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Roughly 29% of lower-income households are living paycheck to paycheck, up slightly from 2024 and from 27.1% in 2023, data from the Bank of America Institute shows. The financial firm defines that as spending more than 95% of household income on necessities such as housing, gasoline, groceries, utility bills and internet service.",
      "In 2025, nearly a quarter of all U.S. households lived paycheck to paycheck, Bank of America estimates. Several factors explain why many people are falling behind.",
      "First, the nation's inflation rate this year has edged up to an annual rate of 3%\u00a0after dipping to 2.3% in April. The rise in consumer prices this year is well below their pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in 2022, but remains above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%.",
      "\"Inflation is picking back up again, and cost increases are picking back up again,\" said Joe Wadford, an economist at the Bank of America Institute, which recently\u00a0examined\u00a0the financial pressures facing Americans by income. \"That's definitely going to put some renewed pressure on those households.\"",
      "Second, the cost of groceries and other essentials is continuing to rise as lower-wage workers see their paychecks and purchasing power stagnate. In October, wages for lower-income households were up only 1% from a year ago, according to Bank of America deposit data.",
      "\"The gap between their wages and expenses has just continued to widen since the beginning of the year,\" Wadford said. \"When the cost of living is increasing 3% but your wages are only increasing 1%, you're just going to really struggle to keep up.\"",
      "Lower-wage workers experienced strong wage growth during the pandemic and subsequent economic recovery, but that rise has slowed sharply since late 2022, according to Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. One factor weighing on wage growth \u2014 a decline in job openings and the rate at which workers are leaving their jobs.",
      "\"When people aren't looking for other offers or quitting, that is going to cause wage growth to slow,\" she said.",
      "In the trailing 12 months through October, higher-income millennial households have seen their average wages grow five percentage points faster than those of lower-income millennials, according to the Bank of America Institute.",
      "While lower-income households are struggling to scrape by, middle- and higher-income households are on firmer financial footing, buoyed by stronger wage growth. This group has seen little to no increase in the share of households living paycheck to paycheck, the Bank of America Institute found.",
      "\"These higher-income cohorts are more able to absorb the recent reacceleration in inflation due to their outsized wage growth,\" Wadford wrote in the report.",
      "That bifurcation is fueling what economists refer to as the \"K-shaped economy,\" a term experts use to describe the divergence in spending and financial health between wealthier Americans and people with more modest incomes.",
      "Gould also noted that many low-income Americans are unbanked and that Bank of America's findings, which are drawn from an analysis of its depositor data, may not fully capture the impact of slowing wage growth on poor households.",
      "\"You're missing some of the bottom end and how much pain [and] economic distress they may be feeling,\" she said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-californias-redistricting-maps/",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 12:56:00 -0500",
    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri and North Carolina redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina is now the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms, following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their House maps, along with a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.",
      "The redistricting push began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats, which was approved by voters on Election Day by a 29-point margin.",
      "In Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map earlier this month to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, signed the legislation on Sunday. In October, North Carolina Republicans targeted a single Democratic district as well, passing a map that redraws the 1st Congressional District to make it lean more heavily Republican.",
      "Utah lawmakers also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans, but a judge in November threw out the GOP-controlled legislature's map and ordered one that will create a Democratic-leaning district in Salt Lake City.",
      "Challenges remain in all states. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create the new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Civil rights groups are also suing in Texas, claiming the maps are racially biased. Despite getting the seal of approval by voters in California, state Republicans filed a lawsuit against Prop 50 after Election Day.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, including Indiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "Utah redistricting",
      "Utah's redistricting is different from the other states' campaigns, starting with the fact that the state does not have any Democratic members of Congress. The redistricting push also wasn't kicked off by Mr. Trump and Republicans or in retaliation for moves by other states. Utah's 2025 redistricting was put in motion this summer when a judge ruled the current districts were in violation of a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature put forward four maps for public comment, and ultimately on Oct. 6 approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. The legislature proposed a map that will split Salt Lake County into two districts, which would make Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But a district court judge in Utah on Nov. 10 rejected redistricting maps selected by the Republican-controlled legislature and instead selected a map that would create a Democratic-leaning congressional district in Salt Lake City. The map approved by the legislature \"does not comply with Utah law,\" wrote 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson in her opinion. She continued that \"based on the evidence presented,\" the Legislature map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "Utah currently has four representatives in Congress, all of whom are Republicans. Both senators are also Republicans. The maps enacted by Gibson create a new district encompassing Salt Lake City that would be 62% Democratic, based on the 2024 presidential results.",

Under Japan's self-imposed domestic rules, an existential threat is one of the few cases where it can act militarily. Taiwan sits around 60 miles from the nearest Japanese island.",

    "story": [
      "Eleven people have been detained in connection with the deaths of four members of the same family from suspected poisoning in Istanbul, the state-run Anadolu news agency said Monday.",
      "A Turkish-German woman, her husband and their two children, who were on holiday from Germany in Turkey's largest city, fell ill on Wednesday after eating several popular street food dishes in the waterside neighborhood of Ortakoy, at the foot of a bridge spanning the Bosphorus.",
      "They were taken to hospital but the two children died on Thursday and the mother a day later. Anadolu identified them as Cigdem Bocek, her son Kadir, six, and her daughter Masal, three.",
      "The father, Servet Bocek, died Monday after several days in intensive care.",
      "\"I offer my condolences to the family members who have passed away, and express my sympathies to their relatives,\" Istanbul's regional health chief Abdullah Emre Guner\u00a0wrote on X on Monday. \"Our investigation into the incident is being conducted with utmost diligence.\"",
      "Istanbul prosecutors opened an investigation, initially focusing on suspected food poisoning.",
      "But evidence has since emerged that the family may have been exposed to pesticides in the hotel where they were staying, Turkish media reported.",
      "Quoting investigators, Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper said a substance was sprayed in a room on the ground floor of the hotel to combat a bed bug infestation, which may have reached the family's room on the first floor through a bathroom vent. Police collected samples from sheets, pillows, water bottles and blankets before sealing the building, the newspaper reported.",
      "The unnamed hotel in the Fatih neighborhood near Istanbul's historic peninsula was evacuated on Saturday after two more guests were taken to hospital with similar symptoms, Anadolu said.",
      "The hotel was sealed off by municipal officials on Sunday, the agency added.",
      "Among those detained were five food sellers, the hotel's owner and two staff, and three people from the pest control company, it reported, without giving a timeline for exactly when they were all detained.",
      "Eight of them were to appear before a judge on Monday.",
      "A toxicology report prepared by forensic experts was expected to be released later on Monday, along with a report on the food samples being checked by experts at the agriculture ministry, Anadolu added.",
      "President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after a cabinet meeting Monday that \"our security forces and prosecutors will lead the necessary investigations to determine the causes of these deaths.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 20:08:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The most advanced U.S. aircraft carrier has arrived in the Caribbean Sea in a display of American military power.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. is set to designate Cartel de los Soles \u2014 a group that the Trump administration has claimed is headed by Venezuela's president \u2014 as a foreign terrorist organization, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Sunday night, hours after the most advanced aircraft carrier in the nation crossed into the Caribbean Sea, the U.S. Navy said.",
      "Rubio's announcement and the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford mark a major moment in what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation but has been seen as an escalating pressure tactic against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Cartel de los Soles' designation as a foreign terrorist organization is set to go into effect on Nov. 24, Rubio said in a statement. He alleged the cartel is headed by Maduro and \"other high-ranking individuals of the illegitimate Maduro regime who have corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary.\"",
      "\"Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,\" Rubio added. \"Cartel de los Soles by and with other designated FTOs including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel are responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters Sunday night after the announcement was made, President Trump said, \"We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we'll see how that turns out. They would like to talk.\"",
      "Cartel de los Soles is not known to be a traditional, hierarchical drug cartel like the Sinaloa or Tren de Aragua The term is instead generally used to describe a loose, decentralized network of military and government officials within the Venezuelan state who are alleged to be involved in the illegal drug trade.",
      "The U.S. has asserted that Maduro is complicit with armed criminal gangs that smuggle drugs into the U.S., allegations that Maduro has rejected. And over the last two months, the U.S. military has\u00a0conducted strikes against at least 22 vessels it alleges were ferrying drugs from South America to the U.S., killing at least 83 people.",
      "\"Through unwavering commitment and the precise use of our forces, we stand ready to combat the transnational threats that seek to destabilize our region,\" Adm. Alvin Holsey, commander of U.S. Southern Command, said Sunday in a statement announcing the USS Ford's arrival in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group's deployment represents a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere and the safety of the American Homeland,\" he added. Southern Command is the primary combatant unit for operations in the Caribbean and South America.",
      "The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations, in what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dubbed Operation Southern Spear. The Ford's carrier strike group, which includes squadrons of fighter jets and guided-missile destroyers, transited the Anegada Passage near the British Virgin Islands on Sunday morning, the Navy said.",
      "Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the Ford's carrier strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to \"protect our nation's security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "The administration has insisted that the buildup of warships is focused on stopping the flow of drugs into the U.S., but it has released no evidence to support its assertions that those killed in the boats were \"narco-terrorists.\"",
      "President Trump said Friday that he's \"sort of\" decided how to proceed on Venezuela, as\u00a0top officials\u00a0weigh potential military operations in the Latin American country. \"I sort of have made up my mind\" about the administration's next steps in Venezuela, he told CBS News aboard Air Force One, but \"I can't tell you what it would be.\"",
      "Top Trump administration officials, military and senior staff gathered at the White House for at least the third day in a row on Friday to discuss possible military operations in Venezuela, according to sources familiar with the matter. Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were among those who spoke with Mr. Trump at the White House on Friday, the sources said.",
      "Venezuela was also discussed as part of the president's daily intelligence briefing on Wednesday. CBS News has\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that Hegseth, Caine and other military officials presented Mr. Trump on Wednesday with options for potential operations in\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0in the coming days, including possible strikes on land.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuela announced Tuesday that it was\u00a0launching a massive military exercise\u00a0across the country, reportedly involving some 200,000 forces.",
      "Many people both inside Venezuela, including Maduro himself, and observers outside the country believe the increased U.S. military pressure is\u00a0aimed at forcing Maduro out of office.",
      "When asked\u00a0in a recent interview with \"60 Minutes\" if Maduro's \"days were numbered,\" Mr. Trump responded, \"I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.\" Mr. Trump\u00a0last month also confirmed\u00a0that he had authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela.",
      "The president has justified the attacks on drug boats by saying the U.S. is in \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels while claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations. He has faced pushback from leaders in the region, the U.N. human rights chief and lawmakers, including some Republicans, who have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the boat strikes.",
      "Senate Republicans\u00a0recently voted to reject legislation that would have put a check on Mr. Trump's ability to launch an attack against Venezuela without congressional authorization. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only Republicans to support the resolution, which failed in a 49-51 vote.",
      "Experts disagree on whether or not American warplanes may be used to strike land targets inside Venezuela. Either way, the 100,000-ton warship is sending a message, one expert said.",
      "\"This is the anchor of what it means to have U.S. military power once again in Latin America,\" Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst for the Andes region, told The Associated Press. \"And it has raised a lot of anxieties in Venezuela but also throughout the region. I think everyone is watching this with sort of bated breath to see just how willing the U.S. is to really use military force.\"",

    "summary": "The U.N. Security Council has approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the Palestinian territory.",
    "story": [
      "The U.N. Security Council on Monday approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the devastated territory and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Russia, which had circulated a rival resolution, abstained along with China on the 13-0 vote. The U.S. and other countries had hoped Moscow would not use its veto power on the United Nations' most powerful body to block the resolution's adoption.",
      "The vote was a crucial next step for the fragile ceasefire and efforts to outline Gaza's future following two years of war between Israel and Hamas. Arab and other Muslim countries that expressed interest in providing troops for an international force had signaled that Security Council authorization was essential for their participation.",
      "The ceasefire went into effect on Oct. 10, but accusations of violations of the terms by both Hamas and Israel had threatened to upend the deal in the weeks since its implementation.",
      "The first phase of the deal called for Hamas to release all living and deceased hostages in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel. While the living hostages were returned by the deadline, the remains of some of the dead hostages had not been handed over \u2014 with both Hamas and U.S. officials citing the difficulties in recovering some of the remains amid the destruction in the Gaza Strip \u2014 which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said constituted a violation.",
      "There have also been flare-ups of violence in Gaza, including airstrikes from Israel, which it said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces, since the deal went into effect. International advocates have also accused Israel of not adhering to the requirement to deliver all of the aid it promised to Gaza in the deal.",
      "The U.S. resolution endorses President Trump's 20-point ceasefire plan, which calls for a yet-to-be-established Board of Peace as a transitional authority that Mr. Trump would head. It also authorizes the stabilization force and gives it a wide mandate, including overseeing the borders, providing security and demilitarizing the territory. Authorization for the board and force expires at the end of 2027.",
      "\"Congratulations to the World on the incredible Vote of the United Nations Security Council, just moments ago, acknowledging and endorsing the BOARD OF PEACE, which will be chaired by me, and include the most powerful and respected Leaders throughout the World,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media following the U.N. vote. He thanked the members of the Security Council, including Russia and China, and said, \"The members of the Board, and many more exciting announcements, will be made in the coming weeks.\"",
      "Hamas criticized the U.N.'s adoption of the plan, saying, \"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation,\" according to Reuters.",
      "\"Any international force, if established, must be stationed solely on the borders to separate the forces and monitor the ceasefire, and must be entirely under the supervision of the United Nations,\" Hamas said, according to Al Jazeera.",
      "During nearly two weeks of negotiations on the U.S. resolution, Arab nations and the Palestinians had pressed the United States to strengthen the original weak language about Palestinian self-determination.",
      "The U.S. revised it to say that after the Palestinian Authority \u2014 which now governs parts of the West Bank \u2014 makes reforms and after redevelopment of the devastated Gaza Strip advances, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\"",
      "\"The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,\" it adds.",
      "That language angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed Sunday to oppose any attempt to establish a Palestinian state. He has long asserted that creating a Palestinian state would reward Hamas and eventually lead to an even larger Hamas-run state on Israel's borders.",
      "A key to the resolution's adoption was support from Arab and Muslim nations pushing for a ceasefire and potentially contributing to the international force. The U.S. mission to the U.N. distributed a joint statement Friday with Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan and Turkey calling for \"swift adoption\" of the U.S. proposal.",
      "The vote took place amid hopes that Gaza's fragile ceasefire would be maintained after a war set off by Hamas' surprise terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel's more than two-year offensive has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.",
      "Russia last week suddenly circulated a rival proposal with stronger language supporting a Palestinian state alongside Israel and stressed that the West Bank and Gaza must be joined as a state under the Palestinian Authority.",
      "It also stripped out references to the transitional board and asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to provide options for an international force to provide security in Gaza and for implementing the ceasefire plan, stressing the importance of a Security Council role.",
      "The U.S. resolution calls for the stabilization force to ensure \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\" and \"the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.\" A big question is how to disarm Hamas, which has not fully accepted that step.",
      "It authorizes the force \"to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate\" in compliance with international law, which is U.N. language for the use of military force.",
      "The resolution says the stabilization troops will help secure border areas, along with a Palestinian police force that they have trained and vetted, and they will coordinate with other countries to secure the flow of humanitarian assistance. It says the force should closely consult and cooperate with neighboring Egypt and Israel.",
      "As the international force establishes control and brings stability, the resolution says Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\" These must be agreed to by the stabilization force, Israeli forces, the U.S. and the guarantors of the ceasefire, it says.",

    "summary": "The attackers, who have not yet claimed responsibility publicly, killed one person and kidnapped more than two dozen students.",
    "story": [
      "More than two dozen schoolgirls have been abducted and one staffer has been killed after gunmen attacked a high school in northwestern Nigeria, police said in the region.",
      "No group immediately claimed responsibility for the abductions of 25 girls from the boarding school in Kebbi state, and the motivation for the attack is unclear.",
      "Nigeria has been facing a multi-dimensional security challenge with threats from a range of different groups. Armed bandits who specialize in kidnapping for ransom \u2014 sometimes totaling thousands of dollars \u2014 have been responsible for several high-profile abductions across Nigeria's northern region. Kidnappings and attacks on villages and along major roads have become common because of the limited security presence.",
      "Those bandits are not connected to militant groups such as Boko Haram and the splinter group Islamic State West Africa Province, whose attacks on communities and government installations are motivated by religion.",
      "Police said the boarding school girls were taken from their dorms at about 4 a.m. Monday. The school is in Maga, in the state's Danko-Wasagu area, police spokesperson Nafi'u Abubakar Kotarkoshi said.",
      "The assailants were armed with \"sophisticated weapons\" and exchanged fire with guards before abducting the girls, Kotarkoshi said.",
      "\"A combined team is currently combing suspected escape routes and surrounding forests in a coordinated search and rescue operation aimed at recovering the abducted students and arresting the perpetrators,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Attacks have targeted schoolchildren in the region since at least 2014, when Boko Haram abducted 276 students from Chibok in Borno state. That abduction marked the beginning of a new era of fear. Dozens remain in captivity.",
      "Since the Chibok abductions, at least 1,500 students have been kidnapped, as armed groups increasingly find in abductions a lucrative way to fund other crimes and control villages in the nation's mineral-rich but poorly policed region. In March 2024, more than 130 schoolchildren were rescued after spending more than two weeks in captivity in the Nigerian state of Kaduna.",

    "story": [
      "Australian cyclist Paige Greco, a Paralympic gold medalist, has died. She was 28.",
      "A joint statement by the Australian Paralympic Committee and Australian Cycling Federation said that Greco \"passed away in her Adelaide home after experiencing a sudden medical episode\" on Sunday.",
      "\"Paige meant everything to us,\" her mother Natalie Greco said in a statement. \"Her kindness, her determination and her warmth touched our family every single day. She brought so much joy and pride into our lives, and the pain of her passing is something we will carry forever.",
      "\"While we are devastated by her loss, we are incredibly proud of the person she was and the way she represented Australia.\"",
      "Greco, who was born with cerebral palsy, won the first gold medal of the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Paralympics in 2021, breaking her own world record in the women's C1-3 3,000-meter individual pursuit. She went on to add bronze medals in the road race and time trial.",
      "In August, she won another bronze medal at the para-cycling World Championships in Belgium, this time for the C3 road race event, BBC News reported.",
      "Greco also won multiple world championship titles and World Cup medals, after bursting onto the para-cycling scene with three world records, two gold medals and a silver at the 2019 track world championship \u2014 just a year after switching to cycling from para-athletics.",
      "Cameron Murray, chief executive officer of Paralympics Australia, said the loss of one of the brightest young stars of the Australian Paralympic movement was devastating.",
      "\"The sadness being felt across Paralympics Australia today is a reflection of the enormous regard in which she was held,\" Murray said. \"Paige was an extraordinary athlete, but more importantly, a remarkable person.",
      "\"Her achievements on the international stage were exceptional, but it was her kindness, her quiet determination and the way she uplifted people around her that will stay with us all. She had a rare ability to make people feel included and supported, and her influence will no doubt leave a lasting impression on so many.\"",
      "AusCycling's Chief Executive Officer Marne Fechner called Greco\u00a0an \"extraordinary athlete who achieved outstanding accomplishments at the highest levels of [the] sport.\"",
      "\"Much more than that, she touched the lives of everyone around her with her positive spirit and courageous outlook,\" Fechner said.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 11:22:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A human rights group says the \"rate at which people are killed in Israeli custody\" shows a loss of \"all moral and professional restraint.\"",
    "story": [
      "At least 94 Palestinians died in Israeli custody between Oct. 7, 2023, and August 2025, according to a report by an Israel-based human rights group led by medical professionals, representing a dramatic surge in prisoner deaths during the war in Gaza.",
      "The report by Physicians for Human Rights \u2014 Israel (PHRI) says its figures may only represent a portion of the total actual deaths of Palestinians in civil or military detention.",
      "The PHRI says its research revealed \"deeply concerning patterns of physical violence and medical negligence,\" which it says were the two primary factors behind the deaths of most Palestinians in Israeli custody.",
      "\"The alarming rate at which people are killed in Israeli custody reveals a system that has lost all moral and professional restraint,\" said Naji Abbas, a director at PHRI.",
      "PHRI documented the deaths by interviewing former detainees and prison medical staff, examining reports prepared by doctors who observed autopsies at the behest of dead prisoners' families, and confirming dozens of fatalities through freedom of information requests for Israeli government data.",
      "The Israeli prison service said in response to the PHRI report that all of its facilities are operated in adherence with Israeli laws and with proper oversight.",
      "The PHRI says it analyzed post-mortem examinations that showed some Palestinian detainees died after sustaining bruising \"consistent with beatings,\" multiple rib fractures, hemorrhages and lacerations of intra-abdominal organs.",
      "Among the examples it cites of purported medical negligence, the PHRI notes one case of documented severe malnutrition and several cases of severe infections that it said were left untreated.",
      "The authors of the report used official Israeli data obtained through freedom of information requests as well as individual inquiries to compile its report. It says that of the 94 Palestinians who died in Israeli detention facilities since October 2023, 68 were from the Gaza Strip. The remaining 26 were from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and some also held Israeli citizenship.",
      "PHRI says the actual death toll over this timeframe is \"likely significantly higher,\" noting that Israel has refused to provide information about hundreds of Palestinians detained during the war.",
      "Fewer than 30 Palestinians died in Israeli custody in the 10 years preceding the war, the PHRI says. But since the war sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, the organization says Israel's prison population more than doubled to 11,000 as people were rounded up, mainly from Gaza and the West Bank.",
      "The number of prisoners dying grew at an even faster rate over that period, PHRI data show.",
      "In response to the report, the Israel Prison Service told CBS News it operates \"in accordance with the law and under the supervision of official oversight bodies.\"",
      "The service said it was not aware of the specific incidents presented in the report, and that the claims \"do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service.\"",
      "The IPS also maintains that inmates have adequate access to medical care, hygiene and adequate living conditions.",
      "Last year, the far-right, nationalist government minister in charge of Israel's prison system, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, boasted that he had degraded prison conditions to the legal minimum, vowing they would no longer be \"summer camps.\"",
      "Under pressure from rights groups, conditions in Israeli detention facilities have improved slightly in recent months, the PHRI says.",
      "Personal testimonies from prison staff",
      "A former nurse at the Sde Teiman military prison in southern Israel, whom the PHRI said had spoken on the condition of anonymity, told the organization chains were used to shackle many prisoners' arms and legs, causing such severe wounds in some cases that Palestinians' limbs had to be amputated.",
      "During the several weeks in early 2024 when she said she worked at the facility, which has held many detainees from Gaza and been the focus of high-profile abuse allegations, she said she didn't see anyone die, but that staff had mentioned prisoner deaths. PHRI said she left the job in response to the alleged abusive treatment of the prisoners.",
      "The Israeli army said prolonged handcuffing is implemented only in exceptional cases, when there are \"significant security considerations.\" Even then, detainees' medical condition is taken into account, it said. Only a few detainees from Gaza are currently being handled this way, it added.",
      "A former Sde Teiman guard told PHRI that colleagues were at some point asked by their commanders \u2014 whom she said participated in the beatings \u2014 to reduce the number of deaths. Eventually cameras were installed, which helped mitigate the alleged abuse, the PHRI says.",
      "PHRI's report says 29 prisoners have died at Sde Teiman since the war began. Earlier this year, an Israeli soldier was convicted of abusing Palestinian detainees at Sde Teiman and sentenced in a high profile case to seven months in prison, which the army said was evidence of accountability.",
      "But lawyers for prisoners say Israel rarely conducts serious investigations into alleged violence, which it claims fuels the problem.",
      "In a sign of the public mood on the issue, the Israeli military's top lawyer was recently forced to resign after admitting that she had approved the leak of a surveillance video at the center of an investigation into allegations of severe abuse against a Palestinian detainee at Sde Teiman.",
      "She said she intended the leak to defend the decision by her office to prosecute guards for the alleged abuses. Instead, it triggered fierce criticism from hard-line Israelis, including some in the government, who sympathized with the guards. Sde Teiman and another detention center were swarmed by angry protesters who clashed with prison guards and tried to breach both facilities.",
      "Several soldiers were indicted in the case, which is still pending before a military court.",
      "It is difficult to pinpoint with certainty the cause of death for most prisoners. Sometimes, at the behest of prisoners' families, doctors were granted permission by Israel to attend autopsies and provided reports to the families on what they saw.",
      "Purported medical negligence",
      "Eight reports cited by the PHRI and seen by The Associated Press showed a pattern of physical abuse and medical neglect.",
      "In one, a 45-year-old man who died in Kishon detention center, Mohammad Husein Ali, showed multiple signs of physical assault, likely causing brain bleed, according to the report. The potential use of excessive restraints was also noted.",
      "His family said he was healthy before he was detained at his home in the West Bank. He died within a week of being imprisoned.",
      "Malnutrition was a contributing factor in at least one detainee death, according to PHRI, with a 17-year-old boy dying from starvation.",
      "In September, Israel's Supreme Court ordered that more and better food be served to Palestinian inmates. Rights groups say the situation has slightly improved.",
      "The army said detainees receive three meals a day, approved by a dietitian. It said every detainee is examined by a doctor upon arrival and, for those who need it, monitored with regular checkups.",

Around the same time, a missing man's body was discovered on a melting glacier in Pakistan, 28 years after he went missing.",
      "In July 2024, the preserved body of an\u00a0American mountaineer was found\u00a022 years after he disappeared while scaling a snowy peak in Peru. A month before that,\u00a0five frozen bodies were retrieved\u00a0from Mount Everest \u2014\u00a0 including one that was just skeletal remains \u2014 as part of Nepal's mountain clean-up campaign on Everest and adjoining peaks Lhotse and Nuptse.",

      "There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin to the French-Ukrainian military agreement, which both Paris and Kyiv touted as a landmark moment.",
      "\"Today marks a significant moment, truly historic for both our nations \u2014   France and Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post, adding that the joint defense agreement, \"enables Ukraine to procure military equipment from France's defense industrial and technological base, including 100 Rafale F4 aircraft by 2035 for Ukraine's combat aviation, SAMP/T air-defense systems, air-defense radars, air-to-air missiles, and aerial bombs.\"",

      "Hasina and Khan faced the charges of crimes against humanity over the killing of hundreds of people during a student-led uprising in July and August of 2024. The United Nations in a February report said up to 1,400 may have been killed in the violence, while the country's health adviser under the interim government said more than 800 people were killed and about 14,000 were injured.",
      "The deliberation of the verdict from the tribunal in the capital, Dhaka, was broadcast live on Monday.",
      "The interim government beefed up security ahead of the verdict, with paramilitary border guards and police deployed in Dhaka and many other parts of the country. CBS News' British partner network BBC News said security forces had deployed tear gas amid unrest following the announcement of the sentencing on the streets of Dhaka on Monday.",
      "Hasina's Awami League party has called for a nationwide shutdown to protest the verdict. Hasina and Khan, who have been in exile in India, were tried in absentia.",
      "Both Hasina and her party have called the tribunal a \"kangaroo court\" and denounced the appointment of a lawyer by the state to represent her.",
      "The tribunal last week had fixed Monday for delivering the verdict as reports of explosions of crude bombs and arson led to the disruption of classes and transportation across the country after the \"lockdown\" called for by Hasina's party.",
      "Before the tribunal's ruling Monday, the former ruling party called for the shutdown again, with Hasina in an audio message urging her supporters not to be \"nervous\" about the verdict.",
      "The verdict came after local media reported new explosions of crude bombs in Dhaka, including one in front of the house of an adviser, equivalent to a Cabinet minister, on Sunday.",
      "Meanwhile, Dhaka's police chief Sheikh Mohammad Sazzat Ali issued a \"shoot-on-sight\" order if anyone attempts to torch vehicles or hurl crude bombs. The directive came as nearly 50 arson attacks, mostly targeting vehicles, and dozens of explosions of crude bombs have been reported nationwide over the past week. Two people were killed in the arson attacks, local media reported.",
      "Authorities at the Supreme Court, in a letter to army headquarters on Sunday, requested the deployment of soldiers around the tribunal premises ahead of the verdict.",
      "Hasina was ousted on Aug. 5 last year and fled to India. Bangladeshi Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took over as the head of an interim government three days after her fall. Yunus vowed to punish Hasina and banned the activities of her Awami League party.",
      "Yunus said his interim government would hold the next elections in February, and that Hasina's party would not get a chance to contest the race.",
      "Dhaka-based human rights activist Shireen Huq, who works with people injured during the unrest, told the BBC on Monday that the \"harsh punishment\" for Hasina would offer little solace for the families of people killed and maimed during last summer's crackdown on protesters.",
      "\"They will never be able to forgive her,\" she told the BBC, adding that many people's anger at Hasina's political party also had \"not subsided.\"",
      "\"Neither she nor the party has apologized or shown any remorse for the killings of hundreds of people,\" Huq said. \"It makes it difficult for the party to be accepted by a majority of people in this country.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. \u00a0On Friday, we spoke with the Chairman of one of the Senate committees responsible for crafting health care legislation, Louisiana's Bill Cassidy, who is also a doctor. We began by showing him what the President is thinking of for a healthcare fix.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm calling today for insurance companies not to be paid, but for the money, this massive amount of money to be paid directly to the people of our country so that they can buy their own health care, which will be far better and far less expensive than the disaster known as Obamacare.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you, Senator, coordinating with the White House on this proposal?",
      "SEN. BILL CASSIDY: So we're absolutely in communication with the White House and with the administration, because there's a lot of stuff that you have to work out to do that. But let me give a little meat on the bones of what the President's speaking about. If you look at an Obamacare policy now, there's a $6,000 deductible. Democrats are fighting to lower the premiums. You lower a premium on something which has $6,000 deductible, it's basically a catastrophic policy. Now, I like to speak of the cost of being insured, not just the cost of the health insurance. The President is proposing that we take the $26 billion that would be going to insurance companies if we just do a straight out extension, and by the way, 20 percent of that $26 billion, 20 percent will go for profit and administrative overhead, give it directly to the American people in an account in which 100 percent of the money is used for them to purchase health care on their own terms. Now- now, that makes them an informed consumer. It also helps address the need to have coverage for that deductible, and if they get that policy with a higher deductible, they can actually lower their premium. It's a sweet spot, lower premiums, help with the deductible, making the patient the informed consumer, the President and I are united. We should all be united about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President's economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, was on this program last Sunday. He said the president was just brainstorming, things aren't formally put together among Republican senators yet, but I just want to clarify what you are coordinating with the President on here, because, is it to buy your own insurance policy, which is kind of complicated, or is it to use this flexible spending account you've talked about for related health care needs? Like, are there restrictions on how you can use that money?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: So first, there's two types of premium tax credits. There's the baseline premium tax credit, which was part of Obamacare, that would stay in effect, and people would still buy a policy. For example, they get in a car wreck, something disastrous. They need somebody negotiating on their behalf with all the providers. That stays the same. What we're talking about the shutdown was over the enhanced premium tax credits. Policies have become so expensive under Obamacare that under Joe Biden, Democrats passed another subsidy on top of the first subsidy. That's what we're fighting about and what Republicans are saying, and I like to hope Democrats will too. Hey, wait a second, if we can have lower premiums and help people with their deductible by giving the money directly to the patient. By the way, 20 percent doesn't go for insurance company profit and overhead. 100percent goes for health care. Why don't we unite Republican and Democrats in doing that? That's where the President is. You got to figure some things out. But we're a lot further along than you might imagine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you want to fix Obamacare, or do you want to eliminate Obamacare?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: First, you have to, like, we're going into 2026. That's like a month and a half from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: And so you've got to work with what you have. But on the other hand, Obamacare was a top heavy, administratively heavy type system in which a lot of money is a lot of money, and responsibility is taken from individuals and given to insurance companies. As one example, I'm a doctor. I work for 20 years in a hospital for the uninsured. I found that if you give the patient the power, good things happen that's supported, by the way, by the medical literature, if the patient is engaged in her health care and the health care of her family. She's going to be a wise shopper, wise for her health and wise for her pocketbook. We need to have a new model, and that model is to engage the patient in her own health care. Doing so is good for her, good for us all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but you said we need to work with what we have. That is, as you just said, you have a short amount of time before the end of the year. Do you think you need to extend the health care tax subsidies that are currently in place until you figure out all the rest of this complicated policy making?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Let me back you up just a little bit, Margaret. I'll just say, everybody assumes it's easy just to extend the premium tax credits, the enhanced premium tax credits. It's not that easy. 50 percent of the states did not plan on them being extended, and they don't have rates as if they were to be extended. So that means if we pass this mid December, they've got to recalculate rates in time for, wait a second, by that time, we're already into 2026 it's not an easy matter. And by the way, did I mention the policies that people want to lower the premiums for have $6,000 deductibles. It is basically something for insurance companies to make money off of and for the individual to wade through $6,000 of debt before they can finally access it. Now, the kind of proposal I am proposing Republicans are, and I hope Democrats will join, is, let's take that money, and we have a mechanism to do so. We give it to the patient. By giving her that money, she could choose a bronze level plan, which is to say lower premiums. So now her premiums are down, but she has money in an account to help with the deductible, and I think we can figure that out about as easily as we can figure out what we would do if we just did a straight out extension.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to do all this, though, by the second week of December, when the Democrats have been promised they'll have a vote on an ACA bill of their choice.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Yes, and I tell my Democratic colleagues first, let's not be Democrats and Republicans. Let's be Americans, representing all of Americans. Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies, but we can do it better with lower premiums and with money and accounts to pay deductibles. And then why don't we come together? There can be a Democratic bill and a Republican bill, and both fail. Let's do an American bill where the American people benefit and this work together, collaborate to lower those premiums and help them with that first dollar coverage in the- in the deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we looked and there are about 293,000 Louisianans, your state, enrolled in Obamacare currently, six weeks from now, those extent expanded tax credits that you've been talking about will go away for individuals making $62,000 or above. Individuals making less than that amount will see their tax credit shrink. So are you telling those hundreds of thousands of Louisianans that that tax credit is going away no matter what, that- that they should make plans\u2013",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 for higher prices?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I'm telling them that we're I'm telling them that we are working to make it work better for them. And they would tell you, by the way, wait a second, I got a $6,000 deductible that does not work for me. Margaret, I'm a doctor. I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, I can't afford that. My deductible is too high. That's reality, and that reality is being lost in this discussion. We've got to do something about sky high deductibles. Maybe you can afford the premium. You can't afford the policy. Let's lower the cost of having health insurance, focusing by not just on the premium, but the deductible. And I think we can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, even in the private market, health care costs have gone up up six to 9 percent when you look at the projections. But I want to ask you about your oversight role. Secretary Kennedy has this hand picked panel of vaccine advisors. You know them at ACIP. They're going to meet in a few days and potentially vote on changing the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants. That same vaccine advisory group is also considering the safety of vaccine ingredients like aluminum, which would impact a number of childhood shots. This should matter for American parents. Are you comfortable with what they are about to put to a vote?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I'm very concerned about this. As it turns out, my medical practice focused on hepatitis B, and so we know that because of a recommended dose at birth of hepatitis B vaccine, recommended, not mandated, the number of children born contracting hepatitis B at birth, or shortly thereafter, has decreased from about 20,000, 20 years ago to like 200 now. That's 20- effectively a clerical error. We have decreased incidence of chronic hepatitis B by 20,000 people over the last two decades with this kind of recommendation. And by the way, if you're infected at birth, you're more likely- you're 95 percent likely to become a chronic carrier. The vaccine is safe. It has been established, and these ingredients they're speaking of have been shown to be safe. This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels. I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease. I want people to be healthy. I want to make America healthy, and you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president of the United States also told American women not to take Tylenol. Or give it to their kids. This is based on a theory that it causes autism somehow. And he also in a social media post, the same one, called for the measles, mumps and rubella shot to be broken up into three different shots. That was then endorsed by the acting CDC director. Are you concerned by this kind of suggestive linkage at the top of the CDC and from the White House?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Again, I'm a doctor, and so I'm going to go where the evidence takes me. And the best evidence is a study out of Sweden with 2 million children that found no- no causality, no association, if you will, between taking Tylenol in pregnancy and getting autism. And of course, that concerns me, because there's going to be a mom out there \u2014again, I'm a doctor, I talk to I talk to patients\u2014 in a room, and her child has autism. She took Tylenol for a high fever during pregnancy and now she blames herself. That's just the way mamas think, and that's wrong. We don't want her to think that. The best evidence is that there is no relationship, by the way, if you have a high fever during pregnancy, that may be a risk for autism. Now, of course, if you're pregnant, talk to your physician before you take anything, but point being, the best evidence is that there is no relationship between the two. And I don't want women putting themselves on a guilt trip when the best evidence shows not. By the way, the President has spoken out strongly in favor of immunizations in other cases, and I noted, when he got his physical, he got the flu and COVID shots. So the President has demonstrated that he believes in immunization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's why clarifying the statements, I think, is important, since you interpret them differently. I wonder, do you regret your confirmation vote for Secretary Kennedy?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I smile because every reporter asks me that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, because these questions run right into a pledge that you extracted from him not to tinker with some of the structures that were set in place to have oversight of these vaccines and this process.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: So you live life forward, again, you just do, let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra-processed food that has, frankly, never received this sort of attention before, and people praise him for that. So he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others, and so, so that's how I'll answer your question.",
      "if this is your final year in office, sir, will you make overhauling health care your top priority?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Well, I sure hope it's not my final year in office, but, but I've been thinking about healthcare for 30 years, because when I worked in a public hospital for the uninsured, I saw the burden it could be on middle-income families who had middle income but couldn't afford the insurance or couldn't assure afford the healthcare. And so it's been my priority for 30 years, and I will continue to do that. And if there is a silver lining, if there is a silver lining in the shutdown, we just had, the silver lining is now we are focused on how do we make health care more affordable for the American people. That should be our goal, not to be partisan one way or the other. How do we make it more affordable for fellow Americans? If we can accomplish that, I will feel like I've done my job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Thank you Margaret.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Good morning. Nice to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well you have spent a good part of the past year trying to get legislation through to extend those Obamacare tax credit subsidies. Last Sunday, you crossed the aisle. You agreed to reopen the government, end the shutdown without a guaranteed extension, but with a promise to have some kind of vote on an ACA bill of Democrats' own choosing. Do you have consensus among Democrats that this needs to be a vote simply to extend the tax credits as they stand now or are you open to a broader reform of Obamacare?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well from the beginning of this shutdown I've had two goals. One is to get government up and running again to end the suffering that too many Americans were experiencing because they lost food assistance or they weren't getting paid federal employees, and the second was to address the high cost of premium- health insurance that people are looking at because insurance companies are setting rates based on the fact that those premium tax credits are not- are supposed to go away at the end of this year. I think people are now very aware of the fact that they are going to see huge rate increases double for so many people, and an unaffordable cost of health insurance if those premium tax credits go away. And what I think we need to do, and these are conversations that we need to have, is we need to work with our Republican colleagues to try and get a bill that can be supported. That can get through both houses of Congress where we've been talking to our Republicans, Senator Cassidy, throughout the shutdown, about what we might be able to agree to. We've been talking to House members on both sides of the aisle, and so now we need to work together. I agree with Senator Cassidy. This should be a bill that is not partisan, but it should be a bill to extend those premium tax credits, because, as everybody has talked about, there is real urgency to get this done. And if we don't address it, then people are going to see huge rate increases. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- So we can work together, we can extend the credits, but we probably can't implement significant reforms that Senator Cassidy was talking about in the time frame that we've got. So we need to look both in the short term and in the long term for how we address the cost of health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so that's an important point. So the 26 billion or so that he talks about as the cost for extension of these that he wants to redirect into these cash accounts, these flexible accounts. You're saying you can't get that done in six weeks time.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: No, you can't. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- And again, there's real urgency to do this. There's some good, bipartisan legislation that has come out of committee in the Senate that I think we should take up. Things that would expedite approval of generic drugs and biosimilars, that would address PBM reform, which is a huge cost increase for health care, but that's a longer term issue. Right now, we need to address what people are facing in terms of those high rate increases because of the threat that these premium tax credits are going to end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to put a fine point on it, when we heard the Congressman at the top of the program talk about, you know, caps on income and restrictions on who can benefit from those tax credits. Can you get your fellow Democrats, who, by the way, are pretty angry at each other, angry at you as well, about this decision to reopen the government? Can you get everyone on board? Or can you at least get to 60 votes to be able to extend those subsidies with tweaks?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, first of all, we need to put the shutdown behind us in the circular firing squad and remember why we're in this situation. We're in this situation because Donald Trump and Speaker Johnson and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate have refused to address cost, the cost of health care, and are trying to throw people off their health care. Can we get to consensus? Well, we need to, if we're going to get a bipartisan bill out of the Congress. I think we've seen and heard from health insurance companies that implementing significant changes in the first year is going to be really difficult to do, almost impossible. But we ought to be able to agree on some changes like capping the income of people who receive those premium tax credits. Right now, 94% of people who get the credits earn under $200,000 a year, and the average income for a single recipient is about a little over $30,000 a year. So most people who are getting these tax credits are not in that high income level --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- And so we should be able to agree on that. We should be able to agree that we don't want any fraud and abuse in the program. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- That's something Republicans and Democrats believe in. So let's focus on what we can agree to. Let's look at what we can get done in the time frame we have, and recognize there is real urgency to get these premium tax credits extended.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're going to have this vote around the second week of December, but premiums are already notified out. They are already --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- Right. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- sort of baked in here for- certainly for Americans who buy government health care. Is it too late to extend open enrollment? I mean, Senator Cassidy was saying like ship has sailed here.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: No, we could actually decide that we were willing as part of this legislation to extend open enrollment. Obviously, we need support from the administration, but insurance companies, in meeting with the insurance industry, they've indicated that while it would be difficult, they could address some of the challenges around not getting agreement until December. Again, that's why there's urgency to get this done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about another matter. Survivors of convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as some of the families of those survivors, wrote a letter to lawmakers supporting the release of Justice Department internal communications in regard to his case. In that letter, they said there was no middle ground here. There was no hiding behind party affiliation. We will remember your decision at the ballot box. You know, this House vote is set to come up this week. Should there be a vote in the Senate? And would you support it, to see the release of these documents?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Absolutely. We need to release the documents. The American people need to see what's in them. And if President Trump says there's nothing there that he's concerned about, then why doesn't he support release of the documents?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see if the Republican leader in the Senate takes up your proposal there. There has not been a commitment to have that kind of vote. But on Venezuela, since you are ranking member on Senate Foreign Relations, I want to make sure I ask you, the President said he has sort of made up his mind on what to do about Venezuela. You were one of the very few senators who have received briefings within the past few weeks from Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth regarding the strikes that are being carried out on these small, fast moving boats. Is there a clear end game here and is your understanding that ousting Nicolas Maduro from power is part of the administration's plan?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think it's clear what the end game is for this administration with respect to Venezuela. They're relying on a legal opinion, excuse me, in terms of the boat strikes that they have not released. They have finally made it available to members of Congress, but they haven't released it to the public. They are escalating in a way that talking about a land strike through special operations that puts at risk our men and women in the military. We have so much firepower now in the Caribbean, the Gerald R. Ford has been taken from the Red Sea, so that now we don't have any firepower, really, in the Middle East as we look at the threats there. We don't have what we need, I think, in the Indo-Pacific or in Europe. And so what the President has done here is to put at risk other parts of the world and Americans in other parts of the world for this fascination on trying to get rid of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela, who clearly is --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- a bad character. He's been involved in drug --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- illegal drugs. But he is not a threat to the United States of America. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- And what the President is doing is raising real questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Shaheen, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Army Secretary Dan Driscoll that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to some of the challenges faced by the U.S. military, and we're joined by the Secretary of the Army, Dan Driscoll. Good morning, thank you for being here.",
      "SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY DAN DRISCOLL: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGERET BRENNAN: A lot to get to with you. Just quickly on news of day, the president did say he \"sort of\" made up his mind on Venezuela. I know this is the Marines, this is the Navy that are deployed. But does the Venezuelan army pose any kind of threat to the U.S. if action is taken?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I think that the President and Secretary of War have spent a lot of time thinking about what is the best thing they can do for the American people, and I can speak from the Army's perspective, which is, we have a lot of training in that part of the world. We're reactivating our jungle school in Panama, we would be ready to act on whatever the president and Sec. War needed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But no orders beyond these exercises at this point?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I- we don't talk about those kinds of things, but we would be ready if asked.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I do want to ask you about what has been happening with this shutdown. The government's now funded through January 30, you did get from Congress full year funding for veterans affairs and military construction, a few other measures in this short term bill. But we have seen the shutdown hit military bases and hit military families. Costly. $400 million or more in emergency loans from USAA. How do you insulate the force so that the next shutdown doesn't hit these families the way it did this time.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I think the shutdown is indicative of one of the bigger problems that we have a nation have had. And so if you look back for the last 30 or 40 years, one of the reasons we've had such bad outcomes, when we spend the American taxpayers hard earned dollars, and we go buy things that our soldiers will need to fight, when we build things where our soldiers and their families will live, we are such a bad customer, because when you're on the other side of the deal with us and you have to deal with shutdowns. I mean, this shutdown will take months and months for us to get back and going on these projects. And this is part of the calcification of our system that under President Trump, we are uniquely able to try to go after a lot of these things and actually get our army and their families living in better areas, and get our soldiers ready for the modern fight. And the shutdown does not help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the modern fight. Tom Cotton, who is the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told our Olivia Gazis here at CBS that the threat to military sites and large civilian gatherings \"is severe and growing.\" He cited gaps in law enforcement authorities, some of them lapsed during the shutdown, I understand, and he's talking about trying to close enforcement gaps when it comes to drones. What authorizations do you need?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: So under Secretary of War Hegseth, the United States Army has been put in charge of the counter drone threat for the Pentagon, and then we are working hand in fist- or hand in glove with the broader law enforcement agencies. We just last week had a meeting right outside the White House where what we are trying to do, because this problem is different from nearly anything we've faced in a long time. It is a flying IED. And so this IED--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: IED, the explosive--",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: IED, improvised explosive device. They're cheap. You can 3D print them at home, and they cross borders incredibly quickly. And so what you basically need is a digital layer to exchange information and exchange sensing and allow the closest person on the ground, or the closest effector on the ground, to be able to take out a drone. And Senator Cotton is right. I mean, this is the threat of humanity's lifetime. What's occurring in Ukraine, what's happening in Russia, if you look at the speed and scale of the devastation that can come from drones, we as a federal government have got to lead on it. But I'm really optimistic. This is actually something we are doing right. We are partnering with both federal law enforcement, in a couple of weeks, we're having the Sheriff's Association come. We were just at the NYPD. We're including all of the different law enforcement agencies, thinking about the borders and the ports and the upcoming NFL games and Olympics and World Cup. Like this is something we as a nation can lead on. And so under President Trump's leadership, we are moving fast at this problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is about radar jamming of drones to take them out, not exploding them.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: So the problem with the drone fight is you need all sorts of layered defense. One solution does not work. If you just try to jam them- if you look at what's happening in Ukraine, people have started to hard wire drones, and so you can't do RF jamming on a hard wire drone. And so there are things like net guns that are coming back, we're using all sorts of solutions and tools, and it makes it even more complicated. When you're by an airport and you're doing it in your own homeland, you just have different authorities. And so a lot of this is a human problem of communication, command and control and having a layered set of solutions that you can use for any given problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're talking about here at the homeland, things like the U.S. hosting the Olympics, the World Cup, even just the Super Bowl, games that are coming up. Should there be restrictions in this country on who is able to own and operate drones?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I'm pretty optimistic that we will be able to figure out a solution where we will know what is in the sky at every moment across our country, all at once. And so if you think of the President's--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're not there yet.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: We're not there yet, but under the President's Golden Dome, I would think about this like a golden mini dome, where, if you took one of the sites for the World Cup, we are heavily focused on being able to see everything in the area, have all of the interceptors we will need, have all of the training for all of the different forces that will have to be able to act. And so to your specific question, I think we are trying to design a system so that Americans are able to fly drones, so that commercial companies, like Amazon- like the future of delivery, in a lot of ways, is commercial drones. And so we will just have to de-conflict the skies, working with the FAA. But this is a big topic. I check in with Secretary of War Hegseth on this almost weekly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when we last saw the President of Ukraine, Zelenskyy, at the White House, he brought up to President Trump, on camera, we've got great drones we want to sell to the United States or provide to the United States. You referred to Ukraine as the \"only Silicon Valley of warfare\" right now. What do you mean by that? Are they really ahead of the United States on innovation?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I think if you look at what's happening, Operation Spider's Web in Russia, the Ukrainians used probably a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of drones and took out almost $10 billion worth of equipment in Russia. And Russia's in that fight. And so I think what is amazing about our country is we are able to recognize where we need to innovate quickly. And what we're doing for drones, completely differently, I think, than we have done as an army in probably 50 or 60 years, is we are welcoming in American industry. So we just did an AI war game where we invited 15 of the top CEOs in the nation. They were worth probably $18 trillion in enterprise value. And we said, howdy, can you please help us? What do you have in your tech innovation pipeline to help us with data in contested environments? How do we do logistics 6,000 miles away if we're facing an enemy who's trying to contest us? And we are working with them, no joke, daily, to basically take their innovation and apply it to this problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what I heard you saying there is, you look at the battlefield in Ukraine as kind of like a test lab for where warfare is going. Can you convince some of your fellow Republicans that there is value in that fight, in terms of, you know, those who are so isolationist they don't want to be involved in Ukraine, even financially?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: Well, I don't think I've talked to a single person who has said we shouldn't be learning from what's occurring in Ukraine. All of our equipment, all of the exquisite features we will need, are definitionally going to come- the data set that the Ukrainians are getting for their generative AI models of when they have drones and they're flying and they're learning and they're doing counter drone and they're taking all of this information from their sensors and trying to figure out what's going on. There's not a single person I know that doesn't think that is an incredible treasure trove of information for future warfare. I think a lot of the questions are, how do we actually execute on the President's agenda of peace in that part of the world. Where- I have not been to the White House, where it has not come up that we just want peace so that the American industrial base can thrive everywhere, and we have to focus on that part of the world unnecessarily right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're at the Department of War.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you announced that the army wants to buy a million drones over the next two to three years. Navy, Marines, Air Force, they will obviously be very involved in any war in the Pacific, but you've got to defend those American bases.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So how do you think of the threat from China there? Because I've read that you think they're ahead of America.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: So we're working on something with Congress called SkyFoundry. And basically the idea is to, again, do it right from the beginning. What the army has historically gotten wrong in the last couple of decades is, we're either all in or all out, meaning we either use our organic industrial base and we make the drones ourselves, or we say, this is too complicated for us, we're going to have private industry do it. We are not doing that with drones. Because if you look at- Ukraine is manufacturing four million a year, China, I think, is at 12 to 14 million drones a year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: And we as a nation will have to have our private sector able to help us. And so what we are going to do is, we are going to invest in things like sensors and brushless motors and circuit boards and a lot of the components that are really hard for the private sector to get right now. The United States Army is going to build those on our bases and empower the private sector to purchase from us. And so we will make drones, our private partners will make drones, and we will catch up and surpass the Chinese incredibly quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary, thank you for your time. And I do want to make the point that you are taking questions, and that is unusual these days, since the Pentagon has restricted access to reporters. And we think it's important here that the American people hear about their own security as well as the military's three million or more employees. So thank you. We'll be right back.",

We know these Covid-era tax credit subsidies for Obamacare will go away at the end of the month.* That's going to hit about 22 of the 24 million Americans who use that program. What can you do in the next six weeks to make costs go down in January?",
      "REP. DON BACON: Well, we need a temporary extension of these tax credits to keep these prices down. Republicans nor Democrats want to see premiums skyrocket, and they will if these expire with nothing in its place. That's why I worked with Tom Suozzi and other Democrats and Republicans to find a compromise. We just want to do a clean extension. Most Republicans don't anyway, so we think there needs to be some caps on income, and we want to ensure all these credits go directly to lowering people's premiums. And right now, about a third of the money doesn't make it to the premiums. So those are some reforms that we would like to see. And if we can get those accomplished, then we can extend these tax credits and keep these- the prices lower, but we do need a longer term fix. The Affordable Care Act is unaffordable, and I think we need to have this extension to give us time to work on something bigger and deeper, and that will help lower costs overall. But I'm proud to work with Tom Suozzi on this, and I appreciate his partnership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, I understand this is a two-year proposed extension of those enhanced premium tax credits and an income cap that phases out for those making between $200,000 to $400,000. When you look at the breakdown, though, that's a pretty small portion of the overall recipients of the tax credits, it's like less than 10%. So what does this accomplish? How does this make it more affordable and fair?",
      "REP. TOM SUOZZI: Well, it helps everybody else who makes under $200,000 dramatically. And the number one concern people have in America is affordability and health care affordability is right at the top of the list. So we need to do something to extend these premium tax credit--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- How much more affordable?--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: -- It'll save people thousands and thousands of dollars, literally $1,000 a month for some people. So it'll be dramatically more affordable. The people who make above $400,000 are the teeny little percentage of people that are not a very small group of people that would benefit from the existing tax credits. Most of the people are below- below $200,000. That $200,000 to $400,000 is a way to taper it off so there's not a cliff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And how much Democratic support do you have for this at this point?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: I think the Democrats are going to strongly back the idea of extending premium tax credits so that we can keep people's insurance affordable. So, we've got to come up with this compromise--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Even with these caps?--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: -- Even with the caps. Yeah, people- Democrats have always said that they want to direct the policy towards lower and middle income folks, people making under $400,000 a year- is- are bread and butter issues that we want to try and make things affordable for those folks. So- and that will be like literally 95%- 99% of the people that are affected right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Bacon- sorry, go ahead.",
      "REP. BACON: I would just say, as Republicans, we push back on the thought of someone earning $600,000 getting all these tax credits. So when I listened to Speaker- or Leader Thune, that was one of his big concerns on these so that's why I wanted to ensure that we had this in our framework.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But a tweak with a not permanent, just a two-year extension. Republicans haven't really been proposing a lot of alternative Obamacare options here. Do you think the entire system needs to be rebooted, and when will we see that plan?",
      "REP. BACON: Well, I do I think Republicans and Democrats have to sit down at the table and figure out, what can we really do besides just throw more money at this. Right now, the- you know, the premiums are just going up so much faster than inflation. It's unsustainable and- but we can't do a Republican only fix it. It's not going to work. You're not gonna get 60 votes in the Senate to do it. And I know certainly some folks proposed that back in Congress. Let's go up with our plan. Well, it can't just be a Republican plan if we want to pass something. So we got to sit down with Democrats and figure out what can we do. And there's some good ideas out there. So for example, you know, I've heard, you know, if we can directly subsidize high risk people and put them in a separate pool and just lower their premiums through subsidies, and then the we can call it, the healthier folks, their premiums go- are going to go down significantly if we do that. So there's different concepts that we can do to that can have an impact, but it's going to- to be a bipartisan way forward. It's not going to be a Republican only bill, because you'll never get it passed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, I mean, Aetna pulled out of the Obamacare marketplace this year after CVS said they expected to lose as much as $400 million. Other big insurance companies have been pulling out. If insurance companies themselves are having problems with Obamacare, do Democrats need to be more open to broader reforms of the Affordable Care Act?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Yeah, we absolutely should be looking at any kind of reform. I want to mend it, not end it. You know that over the past decade that there have been over 70 attempts, mainly by the Republicans, not guys like Don Bacon, who is a very reasonable guy, to try and get rid of Obamacare altogether. We think that's a terrible idea. But if people want to try and make it a better system, to make a- health care more affordable in America and to get health care to more people, we should be doing that. That's what the people want. That's what reasonable people in Congress want. We should be working together to try and expand health care coverage, lower prices for everybody, and make health care more effective and less expensive for people. Now that's not going to happen with everybody yelling and screaming at each other. Everybody says, why don't you just- doesn't know what the hell they're talking about. You cannot solve complicated problems in an environment of fear and anger, you need reasonable people to sit down and talk to each other and say, I think this. Well, I think that, and then work your way towards finding compromise, very hard to do in this toxic environment. People like Don Bacon and other members of the Problem Solvers Caucus want to do that type of thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yeah well, but private health care costs are also going up. But on this topic of toxic environments here Congressman Suozzi, Democrats who won elections just a few days ago credited their wins to this affordability issue and the message focused on that. Can you explain the focus this past week in the House by Democrats on the Jeffrey Epstein files? Is this a tactic to distract from the failure to extract health care changes, or is there something else going on here? I mean, does the Speaker putting it to a vote end this issue?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: I think it's a combination of factors, of people shining their lights on the most hot topic at the time. You know, Jeffrey Epstein, of course, is an important topic. I'm sure I'll vote to release his files, but that's not my priority. My priority is to focus on the things that the American people care about: affordability, immigration, taxes, crime and health care. That's what people are fighting about, that's what they're concerned about, that's what we should be focused on in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Bacon, does the Speaker putting this to a vote end the Epstein issue and get you back on to health care? I mean, the Speaker said this is all a political exercise. Certainly the families of the victims don't think it is.",
      "REP. BACON: I think the Speaker realizes the train has left the station on this. Let's rip the Band-Aid off and get it done. I wish the president realized that. The more the White House pushes back on this. It's, you know, it just looks bad, right? I mean, it was- the attorney general came out and said, all these white binders, we're gonna release all this information and then, a month later, said, Oh, no, we're not. So it's been a PR blunder from the beginning. And I think the Speaker is right, this is gonna happen, so let's get it done and vote on it. Now, we got to realize it still has to go to the Senate. Then it has to go to the president for a signature. Meanwhile, our Oversight Committee is releasing thousands and thousands of pages of evidence concerning Epstein. So for example, like 3,000 pages was released late last week. So the Oversight Committee, Republicans and Democrats are putting out the data. They're putting out subpoenas. I think it's already working, but like Tom when this comes on the floor, I'm going to vote yes on it. I want transparency. We must- we want to protect the victims, but everything else should just be- should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You also. Congressman Bacon, run the Cyber Subcommittee. I want to ask you about something significant this past week that AI firm Anthropic said that Chinese state sponsored hackers used their technology to automate break-ins and carry out the first cyber espionage operation, largely using AI. It hit like 30 different companies. What can you tell us about the scope and the targets of this attack?",
      "REP. BACON: I can't say much more than what was just released. Other than I can say this, China has replaced Russia as the most formidable cyber threat. They have much higher technology. They are using AI, which gives you a lot more capability in finding weaknesses in your adversaries' cyber defenses. What concerns me more than anything, while China is attacking us every single day, and Russia, we've had no commander in charge of cyber command for over eight months. You know, the White House or the president, fired the Cyber Command commander over eight months ago and has not replaced him. Also, the top two positions at the National Security Agency, the top two are vacant for over eight months, and we've been cutting CISA, which is the- the agency that protects our private sector, our businesses, our infrastructure, and we've cut it by about a third. And so our cyber capabilities are going backwards. We don't- we're rudderless in a time where China is attacking us every day, and that's something that really concerns me, and I've been pushing the White House to- to deal with this and to confront the cyber threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will continue following that important story. Congressmen, thank you for trying to be problem solvers with us today. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

In a message on X, Spain's National Police posted a photo of Chavarria wearing a black and green track suit as he was escorted by police officers toward a patrol car.",
      "Chavarria is believed to be the leader of Los Lobos, a drug trafficking group with around 8,000 fighters that was recently designated a terrorist organization by the United States. Los Lobos has been linked to political assassinations in Ecuador and has also been accused of working closely with Mexico's Jalisco New Generation Cartel.",

    "story": [
      "Iran on Saturday confirmed the seizure of a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker as it traveled through the narrow Strait of Hormuz over violations, including carrying an illegal consignment, state media reported.",
      "A report by the official IRNA news agency carried a statement by the Revolutionary Guard that said the tanker was taken to Iranian waters. It did not elaborate on the \"illegal consignment,\" the crew or say where the ship was now heading.",
      "It said the seizure came following a court order and the operation was aimed at \"protecting Iran's national interests and resources.\" It identified the oil tanker as the Talara and said it was carrying 30,000 tons of petrochemical products.",
      "The seizure happened on Friday. Tehran has been increasingly warning it could strike back after a 12-day war with Israel in June that saw the U.S. strike Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "It said the ship had been en route to Singapore when Iranian forces intercepted. A private security firm, Ambrey, described the assault as involving three small boats.",
      "U.S. Central Command forces also acknowledged the incident, saying in a statement on Sunday that the M/V Talara was seized after being boarded by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces via helicopter.",
      "\"IRGC operatives then steered the tanker to Iran's territorial waters where the ship remains,\" the statement said. \"Iran's use of military forces to conduct an armed boarding and seizure of a commercial vessel in international waters constitutes a blatant violation of international law, undermining freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce. We call on Iran to articulate to the international community the legal basis for its actions.\"",
      "A U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton drone had been circling above the area where the Talara was for hours on Friday, observing the seizure, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed.",
      "The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center separately acknowledged the incident, saying a possible \"state activity\" forced the Talara to turn into Iranian territorial waters.",
      "Cyprus-based Columbia Shipmanagement later said in a statement that it had \"lost contact\" with the tanker, which was carrying high-sulphur gasoil. It did not immediately provide any update on Saturday.",
      "Iran has been blamed for a series of limpet mine attacks on vessels that damaged tankers in 2019, as well as for a drone attack on an Israeli-linked oil tanker that killed two European crew members in 2021. Those attacks began after President Trump, in his first term in office, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "In 2022, Iran took two Greek tankers and held them until November of that year. Iran seized the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship MSC Aries in April 2024.",

      "\"It articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express,\" Leo said.",
      "The first U.S.-born pope also acknowledged the financial difficulties facing movie theaters. He said institutions should not give up, but \"cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\" of theaters, drawing applause from the audience.",

    "summary": "The Vatican has returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada.",
    "story": [
      "The Vatican on Saturday returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada as part of the Catholic Church's reckoning with its role in helping suppress Indigenous culture in the Americas.",
      "Pope Leo XIV gave the artifacts, including an iconic Inuit kayak, and supporting documentation to a delegation of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops during an audience. According to a joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church, the pieces were a gift and a \"concrete sign of dialogue, respect and fraternity.\"",
      "The items were part of the Vatican Museum's ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The collection has been a source of controversy for the Vatican amid the broader museum debate over the restitution of cultural goods taken from Indigenous peoples during colonial periods.",
      "Most of the items in the Vatican collection were sent to Rome by Catholic missionaries for a 1925 exhibition in the Vatican gardens. The Vatican insists the items were \"gifts\" to Pope Pius XI, who wanted to celebrate the church's global reach, its missionaries and the lives of the Indigenous peoples they evangelized.",
      "But historians, Indigenous groups and experts have long questioned whether the items could really have been offered freely, given the power imbalances at play in Catholic missions at the time. In those years, Catholic religious orders were helping to enforce the Canadian government's\u00a0forced assimilation policy\u00a0of eliminating Indigenous traditions, which Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called \"cultural genocide.\"",
      "Part of that policy included confiscating items used in Indigenous spiritual and traditional rituals, such as the 1885 potlatch ban that prohibited the integral First Nations ceremony. Those confiscated items ended up in museums in Canada, the U.S. and Europe, as well as private collections.",
      "Negotiations accelerate on returning items",
      "Negotiations on returning the Vatican items accelerated after Pope Francis in 2022 met with Indigenous leaders who had traveled to the Vatican to receive his apology for the church's role in running Canada's disastrous residential schools. During their visit, they were shown some objects in the collection, including an Inuit kayak, wampum belts, war clubs and masks, and asked for them to be returned.",
      "Francis later said he was in favor of returning the items and others in the Vatican collection on a case-by-case basis, saying: \"In the case where you can return things, where it's necessary to make a gesture, better to do it.\"",
      "The Vatican said Saturday the items were given back during the Holy Year, exactly 100 years after the 1925 exhibition where they were first exhibited in Rome.",
      "\"This is an act of ecclesial sharing, with which the Successor of Peter entrusts to the Church in Canada these artifacts, which bear witness to the history of the encounter between faith and the cultures of the Indigenous peoples,\" said the joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church.",
      "It added that the Canadian Catholic hierarchy committed to ensuring that the artifacts are \"properly safeguarded, respected and preserved.\" Officials had previously said the Canadian bishops would receive the artifacts with the explicit understanding that the ultimate keepers will be the Indigenous communities themselves.",
      "The items are expected to be taken first to the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec. There, experts and Indigenous groups will try to identify where the items originated, down to the specific community, and what should be done with them, officials said previously.",
      "A process of reckoning with abuses",
      "The Canadian ambassador to the Holy See, Joyce Napier, said the return had been a key priority for the Canadian government, something the embassy has been working on for years with the Holy See, Canadian church and Indigenous communities.",
      "\"This is historic, something Indigenous communities have been asking for,\" she told The Associated Press. \"Today's announcement is a significant step towards reconciliation.\"",
      "As part of its broader reckoning with the Catholic Church's colonial past, the Vatican in 2023 formally repudiated the \"Doctrine of Discovery,\" the theories backed by 15th-century \"papal bulls\" that legitimized the colonial-era seizure of Native lands that form the basis of some property laws today.",
      "The statement marked a historic recognition of the Vatican's own complicity in colonial-era abuses committed by European powers, even though it didn't address Indigenous demands that the Vatican formally rescind the papal bulls themselves.",
      "The Vatican on Saturday cited the 2023 repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery in its statement, saying Leo's return of the artifacts concludes the \"journey\" initiated by Francis.",

      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",

      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",
      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",
      "In an update on Nov. 13, Google said its request for a temporary restraining order \"was granted just hours after the complaint was filed, and the Lighthouse operation is now essentially dark.\"",
      "Kevin Gosschalk, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, said that while recovering lost money is a challenge, lawsuits like Google's could help disrupt scammers' operations.",
      "\"It has an impact on the ecosystem,\" Gosschalk told CBS News. He said that if there are three major players and you go after the big one and take it down, \"then the other two start second-guessing, 'Hey, should we be in this business, or should we get out of this business?'\"",
      "Google's move appears aimed as much at setting a legal precedent as at seeking punishment \u2014 testing whether a 1970s racketeering law can be applied to a 21st-century digital crime.",
      "Gosschalk said it will be very hard for Google to go after cybercriminals overseas since a lot of them also operate in countries like Cambodia, where there are limited extradition laws.",
      "\"But it does mean the individuals behind those things will not be able to travel to the U.S. in the future, so it does add extra risk,\" Gosschalk said.",

      "\"Home Alone\" is turning 35 this year.",
      "The classic Christmas movie premiered in November 1990 and became an immediate hit, launching its star, Macaulay Culkin, into greater levels of fame.",
      "The movie follows a young boy who is accidentally left behind when his family travels to Paris for the holidays and has to protect not only himself, but also his home from a pair of burglars who call themselves the Wet Bandits.",

      "\"Home Alone\" is celebrating its 35th anniversary this year. (Courtesy: Everett Collection)",
      "It was always Macaulay",
      "Macaulay Culkin was already making a name for himself before starring as Kevin McCallister in \"Home Alone,\" but the 1990 movie made him a household name.",
      "The film's screenwriter, John Hughes, wrote the movie with Culkin in mind. The two worked together on an earlier film, 1989's \"Uncle Buck,\" and Hughes was impressed by Culkin's acting chops.",
      "John Hughes wrote the script with Macaulay Culkin in mind. (Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images)",
      "\"John was such a respectful guy as far as the directors he worked with, and I remember him saying \u2014 based on\u00a0'Uncle Buck'\u2014 [that] Macaulay would be great for this,\" director Chris Columbus told Entertainment Weekly in November 2015. \"But I think it\u2019s just directorial responsibility [that] I should meet other kids.\"",
      "Columbus recalled meeting with \"hundreds and hundreds of kids\" and watching just as many audition tapes before meeting with Culkin. Following his audition, Columbus was convinced, saying he liked him because he wasn't like \"one of these Hollywood-perfect kids,\" adding that \"he was really funny.\"",
      "Scream heard around the world",
      "Culkin improvised keeping his hands on his face as he yelled in the movie. (Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)",
      "One of the most iconic scenes in the movie almost didn't happen.",
      "When speaking with Entertainment Weekly, Columbus provided insight on the famous scene in which Culkin's character puts his hands on his cheeks and screams out in pain after applying aftershave.",
      "\"That was not written the way Macaulay performed it,\" Columbus explained. \"I thought he was going to slap on the cologne and move his hands and scream. But on the first take, he slapped his face and kept his hands glued to his face as if he had just put superglue on his face, and his hands stayed completely still as he screamed like the Edvard Munch painting. That\u2019s why he was such an interesting kid: No one else would have done that.\"",
      "The director loved the moment so much, it ended up being the expression on Kevin's face on the movie poster.",
      "Most famous fake movie",
      "The film Culkin is watching in the movie was made for \"Home Alone.\" (Barry King/WireImage)",
      "When left to his own devices, Kevin sits down in front of the TV with a big bowl of ice cream and starts watching a gangster movie called \"Angels with Filthy Souls.\"",
      "\"Guys, I\u2019m eating junk and watching rubbish! You better come out and stop me!\" he yells out, knowing there is no one there to get in the way of his fun.",
      "The film-within-a-film \u2013 which includes the memorable line \"Keep the change, ya filthy animal\" \u2013 has become legendary, but the movie itself is not real and was only filmed for the purposes of \"Home Alone.\"",
      "The clip was filmed the day before filming on \"Home Alone\" began, and was based off of the 1938 James Cagney film \"Angels with Dirty Faces.\"",
      "\"I believe the title was decided upon only because we needed to create a label for the tape Kevin puts in the VHS player,\" art director Dan Webster told Vanity Fair in December 2015. \"Now that is a very old-fashioned sentence!\"",
      "Buzz's girlfriend",
      "Buzz's girlfirend in the film is the art director's son dressed as a girl. (John Parra/Getty Images for STXfilms/Alexander Wang)",
      "The adults behind the scenes of the film didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings for the sake of a joke.",
      "In one of the scenes, Kevin takes advantage of being alone in the house and starts rummaging through his big brother Buzz's belongings. In doing so, he finds a picture of Buzz's girlfriend, and after seeing the photo says, \"Buzz, your girlfriend\u2026 woof!\"",
      "In a 2013 interview with Yahoo, the actor who played Buzz, Devin Ratray, revealed the picture was not of a real young girl.",
      "\"They decided it would be unkind to put a girl in that role of just being funny-looking,\" Ratray said. \"The art director had a son who was more than willing to volunteer for the part. I think if he had known it would become the highest-grossing family comedy of all time, he might have had second thoughts about it.\"",
      "Box office gold",
      "The film set records at the box office. (Maximum Film/Alamy; Sarah Crowley)",
      "The movie wasn't only a career boost for Culkin, but was a huge success for everyone involved.",
      "Debuting in November 1990, the film held the number one spot for the remainder of the year and into the next, for a total of 12 weeks on top.",
      "It then remained in theaters until late into the summer of 1991, staying in the top 10 until June of that year. Its success in theaters was reflected in the box office numbers, as the film grossed $285.7 million domestically and over $470 million worldwide.",
      "The movie would become the highest-grossing film of 1990 and one of the highest grossing live-action comedies ever. It held the record for 27 years until \"Never Say Die\" broke it in 2017, according to Time.",

      "Pesci actually bit Culkin when rehearsing for one of the scenes. (The Everett Collection)",
      "Joe Pesci portrayed one of the two burglars who were terrorized by Kevin when they attempted to break into his house.",
      "When rehearsing for one of the scenes, it seems Pesci got a bit too in character and left a permanent mark on Culkin.",
      "\"In the first\u00a0'Home Alone,'\u00a0they hung me up on a coat hook, and Pesci says, \u2018I\u2019m gonna bite all your fingers off, one at a time,\u2019\" Culkin told Rule Forty Two in 2004. \"And during one of the rehearsals, he bit me, and it broke the skin.\"",

      "The movie's director almost worked on another classic Christmas movie, but his issues with the film's star led him to \"Home Alone.\"",
      "Columbus was first approached by Hughes to direct \"Christmas Vacation,\" and after directing a series of flops, Columbus was quick to accept the offer, but backed out after meeting the film's star, Chevy Chase, saying, \"I realized I couldn't work with the guy.\"",
      "\"First of all, he's not engaged. He's treating me like s---. I don't need this. I'd rather not work again,\" he told Variety in December 2024. \"I quit 'Christmas Vacation.' The next weekend, I got another script from John \u2013 and it's 'Home Alone.' 'Home Alone' for me was even more personal, a better script, and I thought, I can really do something with this, and I don't have to deal with Chevy Chase.\"",

      "Candy only had 24 hours to film his scenes for the movie, a lot of which were improvised. (Steve Schapiro/Corbis via Getty Images)",
      "When working with a comedy legend, a little improvisation is expected, and working with John Candy was no different, according to Columbus.",
      "\"John took those scenes and ran with them,\" Columbus told Entertainment Weekly. \"We\u2019d do a couple scripted takes and then we would improvise about four or five other takes, and a lot of the improvisation ended up in the film. Whereas something like the church scene was like doing a play \u2014 we did it exactly as John had written it.\"",
      "The filmmakers were lucky to even be able to have Candy in the film, as due to his busy schedule, they only had 24 hours to film his scenes. In that time, the comedian improvised many scenes.",
      "Columbus recalled him telling Catherine O'Hara's character about a time he spent all night alone with a corpse in a funeral home, saying, \"that just came out of nowhere.\"",

      "In a 2019 episode of the documentary series \"The Movies That Made Us,\" Stern explained the shooting schedule was changed from six weeks to eight weeks, but there was no pay increase for the additional two weeks.",
      "After Stern walked away, they replaced him with Daniel Roebuck. However, after a few days of rehearsal, Columbus decided he wasn't right for the part. After offering Stern the part a second time, the actor agreed, and the rest is history.",
      "\"What an idiot I was to let that almost get away,\" he said in the documentary. \"I would have been like, 'Ooh, I missed it, why? Oh, because of my pigheadedness.' Thank God they came back to me!\"",

      "\"Back then, John and I had a conversation about it, and we decided on what the jobs were,\" Columbus told The Hollywood Reporter's \"Awards Chatter\" podcast in December 2024.",
      "\"We thought the mother, at the time, because we used mannequins in the basement \u2014 I do remember having a conversation \u2014 she was a very successful fashion designer. The father could have, based on John Hughes' own experience, worked in advertising, but I don\u2019t remember what the father did.\"",
      "He also dispelled the long-standing rumor that the father was involved in organized crime, explaining that \"even though there was, at the time, a lot of organized crime in Chicago,\" the father was definitely not involved.",

      "Participants also saw less reduction in inflammation and fasting glucose levels.",
      "At the end of the study, those who exercised without the drug showed clear improvements in vascular insulin sensitivity, meaning their blood vessels responded better to insulin and allowed more oxygen and nutrients to reach muscles.

      "On Friday, judges on the panel declined by an 8-3 vote to further review Boasberg's ruling, which in theory would have kept the lower court's ruling in place.

      "But instead of activating anything, the PowerShell command connects to a remote domain named slmgr[.]win, which downloads harmful executables from Cloudflare-hosted pages. The main file, updater.exe, is a variant of the Aura Stealer malware. Once inside the system, it hunts for your credentials and sends them back to the attacker.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) can take a serious toll on families, not only emotionally but financially, especially when every cycle comes with new bills and no clear sense of what the full journey might cost. Gaia Family aims to change that by removing the guesswork around pricing with a blend of tech and AI-driven forecasting.",
      "Instead of worrying about unpredictable costs, couples pay a fixed upfront price or monthly installments that cover their planned IVF treatment, medications, embryo transfers and built-in protections if cycles or transfers aren't successful. It gives families a clearer path forward and support that lasts through the entire process.",

      "How Gaia Family was born",
      "Gaia Family was founded by Nader AlSalim, a former Goldman Sachs executive who knew the IVF struggle firsthand. After spending over $50,000 across five IVF rounds in multiple countries, he and his wife finally had a son. The experience left him frustrated by how little clarity the system offered and how emotionally draining the process could be.",
      "He saw that most fertility systems were built around procedures, not people. His goal with Gaia Family was to build something different, a program that uses data to empower families instead of leaving them to navigate uncertainty and mounting debt. That personal experience became the foundation of Gaia Family's mission to bring agency, transparency and compassion to fertility care.",

      "Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",
      "If a cycle doesn't result in viable embryos, Gaia's built-in protection covers another attempt, helping families try again without financial shock. Once you have viable embryos, your Gaia Plan allows you unlimited frozen embryo transfers (usually $5,000 each) at no extra cost until you have a baby. And, if none of those transfers result in a live birth, then Gaia will give you money toward another cycle. Plus, you have the option of including all of your PGT-A testing and your medication for a fixed cost, so you have even more protection throughout your journey. AlSalim, tells CyberGuy the company's mission goes beyond technology.",
      "\"At Gaia Family, we're using AI not to replace the human element of fertility care, but to bring more confidence to it,\" AlSalim said. \"Fertility treatment can feel like a game of chance \u2014 our technology helps turn it into a guided, informed journey. By analyzing millions of data points, we can forecast the most effective and affordable pathway for each individual, so patients can make decisions grounded in data rather than uncertainty. Ultimately, it's about giving hopeful parents more agency, transparency and peace of mind in one of the most emotional experiences of their lives.\"",
      "SKIN DNA BREAKTHROUGH COULD LET 60-YEAR-OLD WOMEN HAVE GENETICALLY RELATED KIDS",
      "For many couples, this combination of data and compassion is transforming uncertainty into confidence and renewed hope. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Gaia Family's model matters",
      "IVF in the United States can cost as much as $30,000 per cycle, and most couples need several tries. Each failed attempt adds more bills and stress. Gaia Family's fixed-cost model gives families financial predictability while keeping them emotionally supported. It also encourages clinics to focus on outcomes rather than repeated treatments.",
      "This approach is transforming how people view fertility care. Instead of relying on luck, families can benefit from AI insights to make better decisions. While it may not lower the medical costs yet, it changes how couples experience one of life's most emotional challenges, turning fear into informed planning and despair into hope. Gaia removes the spiraling costs, making couples' outcomes so much more cost-efficient.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are thinking about IVF or egg freezing, Gaia Family's model could make your path more manageable. It provides upfront transparency about costs, protection against financial loss and a data-driven forecast of success. It helps you make decisions based on evidence rather than guesswork.",
      "Still, while AI can analyze data patterns, it cannot alter biology. Factors like age, health and genetics continue to shape outcomes. Even so, Gaia Family's system gives couples a sense of control that traditional fertility care rarely provides by serving everyone, with no eligibility criteria in terms of age or health factors. Knowing that your finances are protected can ease stress and allow you to focus on what matters most: building your family.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Gaia Family is blending AI and empathy to rewrite how fertility care works. It replaces uncertainty with insight and transforms risk into reassurance. For many, it's not just about technology, it's about restoring hope and fairness to one of life's most personal journeys.",

      "The proposal amends Title 75 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, creating a new legal category for roadable aircraft. These vehicles would have the unique ability to operate both on public roads as motor vehicles and in the air as aircraft.",
      "The legislation was referred to the Senate Transportation Committee Nov. 5, 2025. Although a similar version failed to pass last session, Flynn remains committed to positioning Pennsylvania as a leader in advanced transportation technology. He believes that laying the groundwork now will allow the state to adapt quickly when these vehicles become commercially viable.",

      "Why this bill matters",
      "Technology is advancing faster than most laws can keep up. The rise of advanced air mobility is blurring the line between cars and aircraft.",
      "Several companies, including\u00a0Alef Aeronautics,\u00a0Samson Sky and\u00a0CycloTech are developing vehicles that can take off vertically or transform from cars to small aircraft within minutes.",
      "Some states are already laying the groundwork for this new era. Minnesota and New Hampshire have passed legislation formally recognizing \"roadable aircraft,\" making them the first states to treat flying cars as both vehicles and aircraft under state law. Pennsylvania now hopes to follow their lead with its own version through Sen. Marty Flynn's Jetsons Act.",
      "At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has begun approving real-world tests. In 2023, the FAA granted a special airworthiness certificate to SpaceX-backed Alef Aeronautics for its Model A prototype, allowing it to operate on roads and in the air for research and development. That approval marked the first time a flying car received official clearance for combined ground and flight testing in the United States.",
      "Sen. Flynn wants Pennsylvania to be part of this growing national conversation. In his co-sponsorship memo, he explained that proactive legislation will help the state prepare for the next wave of innovation.",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "The Alef flying car is made of ultra-light material, allowing it to fly and travel on roads. (Alef Aeronautics)",
      "How the Jetsons Act would work",
      "Under Senate Bill 1077, Pennsylvania would officially define a \"roadable aircraft\" as a hybrid vehicle capable of both driving and flying. These vehicles would need to register with the state, display a unique registration plate and meet standard inspection requirements. When operated on highways or city streets, they would be subject to the same rules as other vehicles. When used in flight, they would remain under federal aviation oversight.",
      "The bill also clarifies how drivers and pilots must transition between ground and air operations safely. It allows take-offs and landings only in approved areas, except during emergencies. Flynn emphasizes that clear definitions and consistent oversight will prevent confusion for both motorists and law enforcement. He hopes this clarity will also encourage manufacturers to consider Pennsylvania a test site for future flying car technologies.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Pennsylvania, this bill could one day change how you think about personal transportation. While flying cars remain in development, legislation like this sets the stage for their eventual arrival. Drivers may one day register, inspect and insure a flying car just like a regular vehicle. Pilots could use the same roadways to reach take-off zones before switching to flight mode.",
      "Even for residents who never plan to own a flying car, the ripple effects could be significant. New rules may influence local zoning, airspace management and infrastructure planning. Communities might see new vertiports or designated landing pads as part of urban development. Insurance companies and safety regulators will need to rethink how they handle this new class of hybrid travel.",
      "The bill also signals a broader change in how states approach innovation. Rather than waiting for federal action, Pennsylvania wants to establish a framework that welcomes new technologies while protecting public safety.",

      "When I looked closer, several warning signs stood out:",
      "The email said\u00a0\"Dear User\" instead of using my name.It also says\u00a0TO: KAREN HILL, which is obviously not me.The sender's address was from a\u00a0Gmail account, not Geek Squad.It listed a\u00a0phone number urging me to call customer support to cancel the renewal, or my account would be debited.The invoice said\u00a0$580.57 would be charged for a two-year Geek Squad subscription, even though I never signed up for one.",

      "BEWARE OF FAKE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT RESTRICTION SCAMS",
      "This fake Geek Squad invoice looks professional, but small red flags, like a generic greeting, expose the scam. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the scam works",
      "The scam depends on fear and confusion. Once you call the number, the person on the line sounds polite and professional. They might say they need to verify your payment or reverse a charge. In reality, they are trying to get your credit card number or convince you to install software that gives them access to your computer.",
      "In some cases, they claim to refund too much money by accident and ask you to send part of it back. That is how victims lose hundreds or even thousands of dollars.",
      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "Scammers want you to panic and call their number. Remember, real companies never ask for sensitive details over the phone or email. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why these scam emails look so real",
      "Scammers have refined their tactics. In this Geek Squad scam email I received, they copied the official logo, used clean layouts and included my actual email address to make it look legitimate. They often get this information from\u00a0data leaks or\u00a0security breaches found online.",
      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) now makes these scams even harder to spot. It helps scammers write natural messages, design fake invoices and create support scripts that sound real. With these tools, they can make almost anyone believe the email is genuine.",
      "Always pause before reacting. Read carefully, check the sender, and question anything that feels suspicious. If you want to stay one step ahead, here are some other things that can help keep you safe.",
      "How to stay safe from scam emails",
      "Scam emails like the fake Geek Squad invoice are becoming more common and more convincing. They use fear and urgency to make you click or call before you think. Protecting yourself means slowing down, verifying every detail and strengthening your digital defenses. Here is how you can stay safe.",
      "The phone number or link in the message connects you directly to scammers, so don't click or call.\u00a0 Once you engage, they can pressure you into sharing personal details or even install harmful software on your device. The moment I saw that \"Payment order settled\" email, I realized something was off because I don't even have a Geek Squad account. That alone was a major red flag. If you ever get a message about a service you never signed up for, delete it right away. Instead of calling the number in the message, go to the official Best Buy or Geek Squad website to confirm if there is a real issue with your account. Also, sign up for strong antivirus software. Antivirus software acts as your digital guard. It scans downloads, detects malicious links and warns you before dangerous sites load. Choose a trusted program that updates automatically and includes email protection features. This extra layer of defense can prevent malware from taking hold if you accidentally click something suspicious.",

      "Scammers often use email addresses that look real but have slight differences, such as extra numbers, misspelled words, or unusual domains. A genuine Geek Squad or Best Buy email will come from @bestbuy.com. Always hover over the sender's name to see the actual address before responding.",
      "If someone contacts you claiming to be from Geek Squad or Best Buy, stay calm and skeptical. Real companies do not ask for banking details, gift card payments, or remote access to your computer over the phone. Hang up and contact the company directly through its verified website or customer service number.",
      "Many scams start with stolen or leaked personal data. A data removal service can help delete your information from data broker sites that sell contact lists to marketers and scammers. Reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for criminals to target you with fake invoices or phishing emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even with precautions, it is smart to monitor your accounts. Check your bank and credit card activity weekly for any charges you do not recognize. If you see something suspicious, contact your financial institution right away to report and dispute the charge.",
      "Two-factor authentication adds another barrier between you and scammers. Even if someone steals your password, they cannot log in without the secondary code sent to your phone or authentication app. Turn on 2FA for your email, online shopping and banking accounts.",
      "Weak or repeated passwords make you an easy target. Create long, unique passwords for each account. A password manager can securely store them and generate complex combinations that are hard to guess or crack.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Old software is one of the easiest ways for hackers to slip in. Keep your operating system, browser and security programs updated. Turn on automatic updates so you do not have to think about it. These patches often close known security holes that scammers exploit.",
      "Before reacting to any invoice or payment alert, go straight to the official account or service mentioned, such as Geek Squad, PayPal, Amazon or your bank. Log in directly through their website or app to verify the details. If nothing shows up there, the email is a scam. This quick step can save you from a costly mistake.",
      "Reporting suspicious emails helps stop scammers from targeting others. Most email services, including Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo, allow you to mark messages as phishing. You can also forward the email to reportphishing@apwg.org, which goes to the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), or to abuse@bestbuy.com to alert the proper teams.",

      "Conduent, which manages critical public services across the United States, says hackers infiltrated its systems for nearly three months. The cyberattack exposed personal information linked to more than 10 million people.",
      "All about the Conduent breach and its scale",
      "Conduent discovered the intrusion in January 2025 and said hackers had infiltrated its network as early as Oct. 21, 2024. During this period, attackers reportedly stole large amounts of data linked to state-level programs such as Medicaid, child support, food assistance and toll systems. Conduent claims that its investigation found no ongoing malicious activity and said operations were safely restored after the breach was contained.",
      "Conduent manages technology and payment systems for dozens of U.S. state governments, processing roughly $85 billion in annual disbursements and handling over 2 billion customer service interactions every year. According to its own estimates, it supports around 100 million residents through various government health and welfare programs.",

      "How the Conduent breach unfolded",
      "In January, Conduent described the event as an \"operational disruption caused by a third-party compromise.\" The breach led to several days of downtime, disrupting vital services in multiple states. In Wisconsin, for instance, parents and beneficiaries were unable to process payments due to system outages, leaving many struggling to meet obligations related to child support and welfare programs.",
      "The SafePay ransomware group later claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging it had stolen 8.5 terabytes of data. Conduent confirmed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that hackers had indeed exfiltrated files belonging to a limited number of clients. The company says it hired cybersecurity experts to analyze the stolen data and recently confirmed that it contained significant amounts of personal information from end-users across multiple programs.",
      "Despite the massive theft, Conduent said there is currently no evidence that the stolen data has been published online or on dark web marketplaces.",
      "HACKERS TARGET ONLINE STORES WITH NEW ATTACK",
      "We reached out to Conduent for a comment, and a rep for the company provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",

At this time, Conduent has no evidence of any attempted or actual misuse of any information potentially affected by this incident.",
      "\"Upon discovery of the incident, Conduent acted quickly to secure its networks, restore its systems and operations, notify law enforcement and conduct an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensics experts. In addition, given the nature and complexity of the data involved, Conduent has been working diligently with a dedicated review team, including internal and external experts, to conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information contained therein, which was a time-intensive process. Conduent takes this matter seriously and regrets any inconvenience this incident may have caused.\"",

    "summary": "Texas startup Janta Power raises $5.5M for innovative vertical solar towers that generate 50% more energy than traditional panels while using just one-third the land.",
    "story": [
      "As AI data centers use more electricity, the solar industry is ramping up to provide more power.",
      "Texas startup Janta Power has secured $5.5 million in seed funding to expand its next-generation solar power towers, a vertical alternative to flat solar farms. The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.",
      "Why flat solar panels are no longer enough",
      "Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day's available sunlight. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.",
      "Janta Power takes a different approach. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.",
      "Janta Power\u2019s 3D solar towers capture more sunlight throughout the day while using just a third of the land. (Janta Power)",
      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How Janta's solar towers work",
      "Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.",

      "Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.",
      "Stronger, smarter and more efficient",
      "Janta's towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.",
      "Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide.",
      "A game-changer for energy economics",
      "The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.",
      "That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.",
      "Built to endure 170 mph winds, Janta\u2019s modular towers are already powering airports in Munich, Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, and across Aena\u2019s global network. (Shelby Tauber/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "CHINESE-MADE SOLAR PANELS USED ON AMERICAN FARMS PUTS US POWER GRID AT RISK: FORMER NSA OFFICIAL",
      "What this means for you",
      "For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.",
      "For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 07:15:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Discover how Apple&apos;s passkeys revolutionize Mac security by replacing vulnerable passwords with biometric authentication and encryption for ultimate protection.",
    "story": [
      "CyberGuy explains how to make safe and secure passwords on your iPhone.",
      "Your Mac holds a lot more than just files. It carries your personal information, payment data, messages and every online account you access. Keeping that information safe starts with how you sign in. For years, passwords have been the standard way to protect accounts, but they are also one of the weakest links in digital security. They can be guessed, stolen or reused across multiple sites.",
      "Apple's introduction of passkeys marks a major step forward. Instead of relying on something you need to remember, passkeys rely on something you have (your trusted Apple device) and something you are, like your fingerprint or face. Together with iCloud Keychain and two-factor authentication, passkeys create a seamless and much safer way to secure your Mac and your digital life.",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys are a modern alternative to passwords. They use public key cryptography to let you sign in without ever creating or typing a password. When you register for an account using a passkey, your Mac creates two unique keys. One is public and stored by the website or app, and the other is private and stays securely on your device.",
      "The public key is not sensitive information. The private key, on the other hand, never leaves your Mac and is protected behind your device's security features. When you sign in, Touch ID or Face ID confirms your identity before your Mac uses the private key to authenticate you. This process prevents phishing and password leaks because no shared secret is ever transmitted to the website.",

      "HOW TO USE PASSKEYS TO KEEP YOUR COMPUTER SAFE",
      "A passkey on your Mac replaces passwords with a faster, more secure way to sign in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Apple keeps passkeys secure",
      "Passkeys are stored and synced across your devices through iCloud Keychain, which is protected by end-to-end encryption. This means that not even Apple can access your passkeys or passwords. iCloud Keychain also has built-in protection against brute force attacks, even if someone were to gain unauthorized access to Apple's servers.",
      "If you lose your devices, you can still recover your passkeys through iCloud Keychain recovery. To do this, you must sign in with your Apple ID and password, verify your identity with a code sent to your trusted number and confirm using your device passcode. The system limits the number of attempts, and if too many failed attempts occur, the recovery record is locked or destroyed to prevent misuse.",
      "You can also set an account recovery contact to make sure you never lose access, even if you forget your Apple ID password or device passcode. This multi-layered design ensures that your data remains secure even in extreme scenarios, such as a compromised Apple account or cloud breach.",
      "How to set up passkeys on your Mac",
      "Setting up passkeys is simple and requires iCloud Keychain to be enabled.",
      "Choose the Apple menu, then select\u00a0System Settings.Click your\u00a0name, then click\u00a0iCloud.Click\u00a0Passwords.

      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds another layer of protection to your Apple ID.

      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",

Then go to\u00a0System Settings \u2192 Apple ID \u2192 Devices and remove anything you don't recognize. Make sure your trusted phone number is still current, since it's critical for account recovery.",
      "Even though passkeys are replacing passwords, many sites still rely on traditional logins. A password manager helps you create, store and fill in unique passwords for every account. iCloud Keychain can do this automatically across all your Apple devices, but if you want more flexibility, you might want to consider a third-party password manager.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing remains one of the most common ways attackers try to steal personal information. They may send fake emails or messages pretending to be from Apple or other trusted companies, urging you to click links or provide login details. Always double-check the sender's address and avoid clicking on links that seem suspicious. Instead, visit the website directly by typing the address into your browser.",
      "While macOS has strong built-in defenses such as Gatekeeper and XProtect, installing strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection against malware, adware and potentially unwanted programs. Strong antivirus software continuously monitors your system for suspicious behavior and can alert you to threats before they cause damage. It is especially useful if you download files from outside the App Store or connect external drives frequently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Apple regularly releases software updates that include important security patches. Cybercriminals often target outdated systems because they contain known vulnerabilities. By keeping macOS and your apps up to date, you make it harder for attackers to exploit weaknesses. To make this effortless, turn on\u00a0Automatic Updates under\u00a0System Settings \u2192 General \u2192 Software Update \u2192 Automatic Updates.",
      "Backing up your Mac is just as important as protecting it. Time Machine automatically backs up your files to an external drive or network disk, keeping your data safe from ransomware, hardware failure or accidental deletion. Make sure your backup drive is encrypted for extra protection.",
      "HOW A SINGLE MACBOOK COMPROMISE SPREAD ACROSS A USER\u2019S APPLE DEVICES",

It's an effective way to reduce your online footprint and protect your identity, especially when combined with Apple's built-in security tools.",

      "5 PHONE SAFETY TIPS EVERY PARENT SHOULD KNOW",
      "AI-powered scams are finding new ways to reach kids who go online earlier than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Nearly 80% of kids between the ages of 3 and 12 already have their own tablet or another connected device. Many parents assume supervision software or family settings are enough, but that assumption breaks down when kids explore apps, games and chat spaces designed to hold their attention. Device access has become nearly universal by early elementary school, but meaningful supervision and honest safety conversations are lagging behind.",
      "The AI threat and the parental disconnect",
      "Artificial intelligence has changed the nature of online scams by making them sound familiar, personal and hard to recognize. Bitwarden's data shows that 78% of parents worry their child could fall for an AI-enhanced threat, such as a voice-cloned message or a fake chat with a friend. Despite that fear, almost half of those same parents haven't talked with their kids about what an AI-powered scam might look like. The disconnect is even stronger among Gen Z parents.",
      "About 80% of them say they are afraid their child will fall victim to an AI-based scheme, yet 37% allow their kids full or nearly full autonomy online. In those households, problems are more common. Malware infections, unauthorized in-app purchases and phishing attempts appear at the highest rates among families who worry the most but monitor the least. The paradox is clear. Parents recognize the threat but fail to translate awareness into consistent action.",
      "Why parents haven't had the talk",
      "There are many reasons this important talk keeps getting delayed. Some parents simply feel unprepared to explain AI, while others assume their existing safety tools will protect their children. Only 17% of parents in the United States actively seek information about AI technologies, according to related research by Barna Group. That leaves a large majority relying on partial knowledge or outdated advice.",
      "Many parents also juggle multiple devices at home, making it difficult to track every app or game their child uses. Some overestimate how safe their own habits are, even though they admit to reusing passwords or skipping security updates. Without firsthand understanding or personal discipline, it becomes even harder to teach those lessons to children. As a result, many kids face the internet with curiosity but without proper guidance.",
      "Smart ways to protect your child online",
      "The Bitwarden findings make one thing clear: kids are getting connected younger, and scams powered by artificial intelligence are already targeting them. The good news is that parents can take practical steps right now to reduce those risks and build lasting online safety habits.",
      "Set up tablets, laptops and gaming consoles in shared family areas rather than bedrooms. When screens stay visible, you naturally become part of your child's online world. This not only encourages open conversation but also helps spot suspicious messages, fake friend requests or scam links before they cause trouble.",
      "Staying involved in your child\u2019s digital life is the best defense against today\u2019s AI threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Most devices have strong tools you can activate in minutes. Apple's Screen Time and Google Family Link let you limit screen time, approve new app installs and monitor how long your child spends on specific apps. These controls are especially useful for younger kids who, according to the Bitwarden poll, often have little supervision despite heavy device use.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Before your child installs a new game or app, take a moment to check it together. Read the reviews, look at what data it collects and confirm the developer's name. Explain why some games or \"free\" apps might ask for camera or contact access they don't need. This kind of shared review teaches healthy skepticism and helps children recognize red flags later on.",
      "AI scams thrive on weak or reused passwords. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins for each account.\u00a0Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible so that even if a password is stolen, the account stays protected.\u00a0Let your kids see how you use these tools so they learn that security isn't complicated, it's just a habit.",
      "Many parents delay important online safety talks because they feel unprepared to explain AI, leaving kids curious but without the guidance they need to stay safe. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "One of the best defenses is simple: encourage your child to pause and talk before reacting to anything unusual online. Whether it's a pop-up claiming a prize, a strange link in a chat or a voice message that sounds familiar, remind them it's always okay to ask you first. Quick conversations like these can prevent costly mistakes and turn learning moments into trust-building ones.",
      "Outdated software can leave gaps that scammers exploit. Regularly update operating systems, browsers and apps to close those holes. Add strong antivirus software. Explain to your child that updates and scans keep their favorite games and videos running safely, not just their parents happy.",
      "The best way to safeguard from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't save these conversations for when something goes wrong. Bring them up casually during family time or when watching YouTube or gaming together. Treat digital safety like any other life skill, something practiced daily and improved with time. The more normal it feels, the more confident your child becomes when facing online risks.",
      "Talking about online safety early helps build trust and awareness before trouble starts.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a parent, guardian or anyone helping a child use technology, this issue deserves your attention. Start talking early, even before your child begins exploring the web on their own. Teach them simple concepts like asking before clicking or sharing. Instead of relying only on parental controls, have ongoing conversations that help them recognize suspicious links, messages or pop-ups. Show them that cybersecurity isn't about fear but about awareness. Model strong digital habits at home by using unique passwords and turning on\u00a0two-factor authentication. Explain why those steps matter. When your child understands the reasoning behind the rules, they are more likely to follow them. Make technology part of your family routine rather than a private space your child navigates alone. Regularly check the apps they use and the people they interact with. Set clear expectations and age-appropriate boundaries that can grow with your child's experience. Staying engaged is the most powerful protection you can offer.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The numbers from Bitwarden show a clear warning sign. Concern among parents is high, yet actual conversations about AI-powered scams remain rare. That silence gives scammers the upper hand. Children who learn about online safety early are more confident, more cautious and better equipped to handle unexpected messages or fake alerts. It only takes a few minutes of honest conversation to create awareness that lasts for years. By taking action now, you can close the gap between fear and understanding, protecting your family in a digital world that changes every day.",

The threat wasn\u2019t hidden.\"",
      "Authorities told Congress they found no evidence that Crooks followed any particular ideology on his laptop, but according to the Post's source, there was a clear timeline of Crooks' changing ideology and violent rhetoric that remains to be addressed.",

It happens in every city and every town, whether you're rural [or in a] city \u2013 it really doesn't matter. But for Charlotte, one thing is that we have a lot of factors that attract demand.\"",
      "The eye-watering number of cases is best explained by North Carolina\u2019s sweeping interstate highway system, high demand for inexpensive labor throughout its agricultural industry and increased amount of gang activity, experts said.",
      "\"Part of the reason why Charlotte is such a huge trafficking hub is because of the highway system,\" Toby Braun, founder of American Special Investigative Group, told Fox News Digital. \"A lot of these traffickers are running victims and may start in South Florida.

      "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrives in Washington on Tuesday for his first White House visit in seven years, marking a pivotal moment to rebuild U.S.-Saudi ties and strengthen a partnership that remains central to American security and energy interests.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, a group of 9/11 survivors, first responders and victims\u2019 families urged President Donald Trump to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for its alleged role in the 2001 attacks. This follows a United States federal district court judge, George B. Daniels, ruling against Saudi Arabia's efforts to dismiss a lawsuit brought against it by the families of 9/11 victims, which alleged the country was party to the attacks.",
      "The visit comes as Trump has publicly confirmed the United States will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, telling reporters on Monday, \"I will say that we will be doing that. We\u2019ll be selling the F-35s,\" a move that immediately places Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge and the region\u2019s future defense architecture at the center of the conversation.",

Thanks to our Dealmaker-in-Chief, the United States secured $600 billion in historic investments during the President\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year, and Americans can expect more good deals for our country spanning technology, manufacturing, critical minerals, defense, and more.\"",
      "A senior administration official, speaking on background, told Fox News Digital that the expected agreements will include a multibillion-dollar investment in America\u2019s AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and defense sales aimed at strengthening defense cooperation between the two countries.",
      "The official added that the visit will also focus on the fulfillment of the Saudis\u2019 $600 billion investment pledge through dozens of targeted investments across key U.S. sectors.",
      "In Saudi Arabia, the visit is being seen as historic. Aziz Alghashian, a lecturer in international relations at Naif Arab University in Riyadh, said there is \"a lot of excitement. The Saudis have said they\u2019re not isolated in the region\u2026 this is back through open doors and the front door again.\" He said the moment reflects a broader shift in how Saudis understand their country\u2019s place in the world. According to Alghashian, Trump\u2019s repeatedly warm comments about the crown prince and the kingdom also contribute to a sense that Riyadh is re-entering Washington on strong footing.",
      "The visit by MBS will be his first White House appearance since the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which U.S. intelligence assessed he approved, a charge he denies.",
      "Jacob Olidort, director for American Security at the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital that \"Saudi Arabia is one of the top partners of ours in the region,\" calling the trip \"well overdue, a reset of relations.\"",
      "At the heart of the visit is the emerging U.S.-Saudi security pact. Alghashian described its purpose in three words: \"elevate, facilitate and consolidate.\"",
      "In his view, the agreement is meant \"to elevate the Saudi-American relationship,\" transforming it from what he called a \"strategic partnership\" into a more formalized security alignment. Although not a full treaty, which Riyadh had previously pursued, the pact would still represent the most significant upgrade to the relationship in decades. He said the shift also has a domestic political rationale in Washington, arguing that being included in an \"alliance\" category \"helps make Saudi Arabia become more of a bipartisan issue, and not just necessarily a Trump legacy.\"",

      "That urgency extends to nuclear cooperation, where Saudi Arabia has made clear that while China and South Korea exist as alternatives, its preference is for an American program. \"Saudi Arabia really wants American nuclear cooperation because it adds more security,\" he said, adding that Riyadh will not \"wait forever\" if conditions become overly restrictive but sees the current U.S. posture as an opening.",

      "Olidort said Saudi Arabia has been \"very categorical\" in what it expects in a changed Middle East: a defense pact and movement on Palestinian statehood. He recalled hearing a senior Saudi official say recently that \"there will be no regional integration without Palestinian statehood,\" a line that reflects the kingdom\u2019s long-standing public position that recognition of Israel will only come after a credible pathway to a Palestinian state is in place.",
      "Still, Olidort said full Saudi-Israel normalization may not be necessary at this moment for U.S. priorities to advance. He said normalization \"doesn\u2019t need to be the immediate priority\" and suggested that \"an upgraded deepening of cooperation, but short of full normalization,\" could be possible if both sides see value in closer security integration.",

      "That perspective is particularly relevant given the war in Gaza and Riyadh\u2019s position on reconstruction. As Alghashian noted, Saudi Arabia has said it \"will not do reconstruction unless Hamas is gone and Israel withdraws,\" a stance that places the kingdom at odds with any rushed postwar plan and, in his view, leaves the region \"in no man\u2019s land.\"",

      "Trump\u2019s decision to approve F-35 sales to Saudi Arabia adds another layer. Saudi Arabia has formally requested up to 48 of the fifth-generation jets, making it the largest potential F-35 buyer outside NATO and the first Arab state after the United Arab Emirates to receive them. The move would test Washington\u2019s commitment to maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge.",
      "Olidort, however, argued that the sale does not automatically threaten Israel\u2019s superiority. \"I don\u2019t know that it will mean Israel losing air superiority,\" he said, noting that Israel\u2019s defense and aerospace sectors are \"world-class\" and that the sale could \"potentially deepen collaboration between Israel and Saudi Arabia and make each of our partners\u2026 more effective.\"",

The Israelis want to make sure that these complications don\u2019t overwhelm the benefits of the plan. Which is a legitimate concern.\"",
      "He warned that the plan faces major challenges but urged against pessimism. \"There are enormous obstacles to the implementation of the entire plan. The U.N. aspect of it is just one of them. We\u2019re already seeing some fundamental disagreement over, say, the definition of disarmament, which could derail the whole effort. Now, I think one has to be hopeful. The opportunity here is huge. The desire to find solutions among the states that are committed to this is real and serious.

Arab countries claimed U.N. involvement was \u2018necessary\u2019 for them to participate and support the Gaza international force. That was a lie and blatant power grab. The proof is in the text which could have been a one-liner noting, with approval, a non-U. N. initiative. Instead, the resolution is a long-list of orders doing enormous harm to Israeli national security, sovereignty and right of self-defense, hamstringing America's range of action by a web of agencies and involvement antithetical to U.S. interests and peace.\"",
      "She said the move is \"an about-face for American foreign policy on the United Nations and the Arab-Israeli conflict,\" and argued that the United Nations \"has repeatedly demonstrated its antisemitic bias, lack of good faith and support for Palestinian aggression.\" Bayefsky added that the draft \"fails to condemn Hamas\" and \"refuses to acknowledge and reaffirm Israel\u2019s U.N.

    "published": "Tue, 18 Nov 2025 02:49:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren had called for institutions affiliated with Summers, who served as treasury secretary during the Clinton administration, to sever ties with him.",
    "story": [
      "Larry Summers, who was treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, said Monday that he will be stepping back from public commitments following the recent publication of his correspondence with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\u201cI am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\u201d Summers said in a statement.",
      "The House Oversight Committee last week released more than 20,000 emails from Epstein\u2019s estate, which included extensive correspondence between the disgraced financier and Summers. The most recent one was from the day before Epstein was arrested in 2019.",
      "\u201cWhile continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me,\u201d Summers added in his statement.",
      "The emails released last week revealed a close relationship between Epstein and Summers. In an March 2019 exchange, they corresponded about a woman Summers was interested in.",
      "Epstein was in jail awaiting trial on the federal charges when he died by suicide in 2019. Summers has not been accused of taking part in the crimes associated with Epstein.",
      "President Donald Trump directed the Justice Department on Friday to investigate Epstein\u2019s ties with notable Democrats, including Clinton and Summers.",
      "A spokesperson for Clinton said last week that the released emails \u201cprove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The emails released by Congress mentioned Trump, as well. In one of the emails, Epstein said Trump \"knew about the girls\" \u2014 but did not accuse him of any wrongdoing. In another email, sent during Trump's first term, Epstein said he was \"the one able to take him down\" but did not include further details or context.",
      "Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any criminal activity.",
      "\u201cThese emails prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters last week.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Monday for institutions affiliated with Summers to sever ties with him.",
      "\"For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,\" Warren said in a statement shared with NBC News before Summers said he would be stepping back from his public commitments.",
      "\"If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein\u2019s sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation\u2019s politicians, policymakers, and institutions \u2014 or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else,\" she added.",
      "Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019. He had been arrested in 2006 after a grand jury indicted him in connection with soliciting prostitution and pleaded guilty to state charges in 2008. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida negotiated a secret non-prosecution agreement with Epstein at the time, which protected him from federal prosecution.",
      "Summers, a former Harvard president, is a tenured professor at the university, serves on the board of OpenAI, is a distinguished senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress and a contributor at Bloomberg, and has served as an adviser at the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "A CAP spokesperson said Monday night that Summers' announcement to step back from public commitments \"includes ending his fellowship\" at the Washington-based think tank.",
      "Harvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Summers\u2019 status at the university had changed following his announcement.",
      "Summers was president of Harvard from 2001 to 2006.",
      "Bloomberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while OpenAI did not provide a comment.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab did not immediately return a request for comment Monday night, but its website, which listed Summers as recently as Aug. 31, no longer includes him among its advisers.",
      "The House is poised to pass a bill Tuesday that would force the release of the Justice Department's files on Epstein. Trump, who previously opposed the measure, now says he would sign the measure into law if it makes it through both the House and the Senate."

    "story": [
      "Whether viewed as a visionary reformist or a murderous despot, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader, will be taking a huge step toward rejoining the international community when he meets with President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday.",
      "Bin Salman, 40, became an international pariah after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a fierce critic of his government, in 2018, though Trump defended the Saudi government even after the CIA concluded that the crown prince himself ordered the killing.",
      "Then-President Joe Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2022 and controversially fist-bumped bin Salman, an image that went viral, at a time when most leaders had shunned the crown prince. Bin Salman said in 2019 that he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the Khashoggi killing since it happened on his watch, but denied ordering it.",
      "But it is bin Salman\u2019s trip Tuesday, his first during Trump\u2019s second term, that will be seen more broadly as a move toward acceptance back into the diplomatic fold.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a different kind of figure now. Obviously, the questions about the manner of his rule and internal repression, those things haven\u2019t gone away. But he\u2019s a changed figure; it\u2019s a changed moment. And, I think, important symbolically in that sense,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a global nonprofit organization based in Brussels that works to prevent conflicts.",
      "He added: \u201cHe\u2019s central to what this administration wants to do in the region.\u201d",
      "Trump and bin Salman are expected to sign economic and defense agreements, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "Even before bin Salman had set foot in the United States, Trump confirmed at an Oval Office event Monday that he would be willing to sign off on the sale of F-35 stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, a contentious move that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East, where Israel has been the primary recipient of America\u2019s cutting-edge military technology.",
      "Trump\u2019s announcement of the sale may not actually lead to Saudi Arabia\u2019s receiving the F-35s anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe devil will kind of be in the details there,\u201d said Andrew Leber, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has done extensive research on Saudi Arabia, noting that a similar deal announced with the United Arab Emirates fell through.",
      "He added, \u201cThat deal ultimately ran aground on a combination of U.S. concerns with maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge and concerns about the extent to which U.S. security technology might leak to China.\u201d",
      "The possibility of Saudi Arabia\u2019s normalizing relations with Israel will be a key part of the talks, according to the White House official. The official said Trump \u201chopes\u201d the kingdom will soon join the Abraham Accords, the 2020 U.S.-brokered agreement that led a number of regional countries to establish formal diplomatic ties with Israel, though analysts are skeptical about a breakthrough.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no near-term horizon for normalization at the moment,\u201d said Hanna of the ICG.",
      "\"The risks for Mohammed bin Salman are extremely high if he joins the Abraham Accords,\" agreed Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. He noted that the Saudis had made clear they would need some form of Israeli commitment to a path to a Palestinian state \u2014 something the Israelis have publicly dismissed.",
      "The crown prince's strategy was generally \"to minimize the risks to his rule,\" said Gerges.",
      "Even if bin Salman does not announce the establishment of diplomatic ties with Israel, he has won favor with Trump as one of the regional leaders who helped pull together the current ceasefire between the Israel Defense Forces and the militants of Hamas.",
      "Trump has long touted his deal-making abilities, and, according to a senior administration official, a number of deals are expected to be announced Tuesday, including a multibillion-dollar Saudi investment in America\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and fulfillment of the Saudis\u2019 $600 billion investment pledge via dozens of targeted investments.",
      "Critics have raised questions about Trump\u2019s affinity for mixing personal business and diplomacy. His properties have for years hosted tournaments for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. And The New York Times reported this weekend that the Trump Organization is looking at a huge real estate deal with Saudi Arabia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some massive ethical questions in here,\u201d said Leber of the Carnegie Endowment. \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that all of the Gulf states have realized that the way you get to Trump is to find some way to enrich his family members, enrich his friends, promise to enrich them down the line.\u201d",
      "Governments dealing with Saudi Arabia, human rights groups have long said, should also push the country\u2019s leaders on its dismal human rights record. In August, a report from Human Rights Watch noted an \u201cunprecedented surge\u201d in executions in 2025, with 241 people killed as of Aug. 5.",
      "Still, the restrictions on women, another regular criticism leveled at the kingdom, have been eased, and bin Salman has tried to open up the society to Western exports, like Ultimate Fighting Championship matches and comedy shows, though the comedians who recently appeared at a comedy festival in Riyadh, including Louis C.K. and Bill Burr, were blasted for performing there.",
      "\u201cThis hasn\u2019t been political reform in the sense of creating space for real politics, but he\u2019s absolutely, fundamentally reoriented Saudi society and changed the role of the religious authorities,\u201d said Hanna of the ICG. \u201cThere\u2019s incredible social change that has happened partly because he\u2019s operating without any real constraints.\""

    "summary": "After immigration officials arrested more than 130 people, some churches report being half empty, an after school program canceled activities and one U.S. citizen said he started carrying his passport.",
    "story": [
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 Jonathan Ocampo has called this Southern city home for six years, but, after immigration enforcement descended here over the weekend, the American citizen of Colombian descent said he doesn\u2019t leave the house without his U.S. passport.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m carrying it here right now, which is sad,\u201d he told NBC News. Ocampo said he worries that his father, a citizen who has been in the country for 40 years, could be targeted because of being Hispanic-looking and speaking what he described as very broken English.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just scary,\u201d he said.",
      "According to the Department of Homeland Security, more than 130 people have been arrested since Border Patrol began an immigration enforcement push it calls \u201cOperation Charlotte\u2019s Web\u201d on Saturday, putting many residents and business owners of the state\u2019s largest city on edge. A popular Latino bakery was closed Monday over fears of Border Patrol activity. Several small businesses in a shopping center also shut their doors Monday after immigration authorities were seen smashing the car window of a Honduran-born U.S. citizen, Willy Aceituno, over the weekend.",
      "Aceituno told NBC affiliate WCNC he was getting breakfast when he noticed immigration authorities chasing two people. Three vehicles then surrounded his car, and agents began asking about his immigration status. \u201cI was scared,\u201d he said. Aceituno, who recorded the incident, is seen on video staying inside his car and telling agents that if they broke the window they\u2019d have to pay for it. An agent ultimately shattered the window, opened Aceituno\u2019s car door and pulled him to the ground.",
      "DHS accused Aceituno on social media of \u201ctrying to distract officers so others could evade the law.\u201d",
      "DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that those arrested in North Carolina \u201chave all broken the immigration laws of our country.\u201d",
      "The deployments in Charlotte are the latest in a string of high-profile immigration enforcement actions targeting specific cities across the country, such as Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, and, most recently Chicago, where hundreds of the people arrested did not have criminal histories, according to the Chicago Tribune.",
      "Ocampo said he doesn\u2019t think Charlotte is unique in being the focus of federal immigration enforcement. \u201cI think they\u2019re targeting wherever there is a strong Hispanic presence, whether it\u2019s Charlotte, whether it\u2019s Chicago, California, I\u2019m seeing on the news, they\u2019re everywhere,\u201d he said.",
      "Charlotte residents have reported dozens of sightings of Border Patrol agents, including one Monday outside the community center for ourBRIDGE for Kids, a nonprofit group that provides after-school programs for refugee and immigrant students.",
      "Several trucks carrying more than 20 Border Patrol agents showed up at the center Monday morning, according to a witness who shared a video of the scene with NBC News. The witness asked not to be named out of fear it would cause retaliation against the business. It is not known whether anyone was arrested. No children were present at the time since programs run in the afternoons, and they were canceled Monday afternoon as a precaution, the person said.",
      "In detailing immigration arrests in Charlotte, McLaughlin said some of the detainees have criminal records, including \u201cknown gang membership, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony larceny, simple assault, hit and run, possession of stolen goods, shoplifting, DUI, DWI, and illegal re-entry after prior deportation, a felony.\u201d",
      "Staff members at the Carolina Migrant Network said they are working on confirming those by tracking down all of those arrested.",
      "So far, some of the people detained in Charlotte include workers at a Home Depot parking lot putting up Christmas decorations, a young man who worked at a grocery store and others in the surrounding areas of churches, apartment complexes and stores, according to Siembra NC, another advocacy group that manages an immigration hotline.",
      "\u201cThis is not about public safety,\u201d said Stefania Arteaga, a co-executive director and co-founder of the Carolina Migrant Network, a legal services group for those facing deportation. \u201cWe are seeing clear racial profiling on our streets and absolute militarization. ... This is about causing fear and destroying, really destroying our community.\u201d",
      "Among the incidents the group confirmed was an arrest a pastor at Central United Methodist Church reported to its hotline. Another incident outside Weeping Willow AME Zion Church involved the detention of a \u201cman who was participating in a church cleanup day,\u201d according to Siembra NC. That man was hospitalized after he had \"a panic attack\" following his immigration arrest, according to McLaughlin, who said that the man unsuccessfully tried to escape from the hospital and that he has a previous arrest in an assault case.",
      "On Sunday morning, a Spanish-language service at Casa Viva Church was half-empty as hundreds of people in the congregation chose to stay home because they are \u201cscared about going out because of the situation right now,\u201d Pastor Alejandro Montez said.",
      "Jeremy McKinney, a North Carolina attorney who was president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association from 2022 to 2023, said an attorney confirmed that some of those arrested had been sent to Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia.",
      "The privately run immigration center, about 2\u00bd hours south of Atlanta in a rural and isolated area, is often used because North and South Carolina have no detention centers. Because of overcrowding in Stewart, McKinney said, attorneys expect some of those arrested could be transferred to Louisiana.",
      "The distance and isolation make getting legal counsel difficult for detainees who can face waiting up to a week to schedule attorney meetings, McKinney said.",
      "Manolo Betancur, who owns Manolo\u2019s Bakery in Charlotte, decided not to open his business Monday after, he said, he witnessed people being stopped by Border Patrol agents outside.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to risk my customers,\u201d Betancur told WCNC. \u201cSafety is more important than any money.\u201d",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ai-generated-evidence-deepfake-use-law-judges-object-rcna235976",
    "published": "Tue, 18 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "AI\u2019s growing abilities to create realistic videos, images, documents and audio have judges worried about the trustworthiness of evidence in their courtrooms.",
    "story": [
      "Judge Victoria Kolakowski sensed something was wrong with Exhibit 6C.",
      "Submitted by the plaintiffs in a California housing dispute, the video showed a witness whose voice was disjointed and monotone, her face fuzzy and lacking emotion. Every few seconds, the witness would twitch and repeat her expressions.",
      "Kolakowski, who serves on California\u2019s Alameda County Superior Court, soon realized why: The video had been produced using generative artificial intelligence. Though the video claimed to feature a real witness \u2014 who had appeared in another, authentic piece of evidence \u2014 Exhibit 6C was an AI \u201cdeepfake,\u201d Kolakowski said.",
      "The case, Mendones v. Cushman & Wakefield, Inc., appears to be one of the first instances in which a suspected deepfake was submitted as purportedly authentic evidence in court and detected \u2014 a sign, judges and legal experts said, of a much larger threat.",
      "Citing the plaintiffs\u2019 use of AI-generated material masquerading as real evidence, Kolakowski dismissed the case on Sept. 9. The plaintiffs sought reconsideration of her decision, arguing the judge suspected but failed to prove that the evidence was AI-generated. Judge Kolakowski denied their request for reconsideration on Nov. 6. The plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "With the rise of powerful AI tools, AI-generated content is increasingly finding its way into courts, and some judges are worried that hyperrealistic fake evidence will soon flood their courtrooms and threaten their fact-finding mission.",
      "NBC News spoke to five judges and 10 legal experts who warned that the rapid advances in generative AI \u2014 now capable of producing convincing fake videos, images, documents and audio \u2014 could erode the foundation of trust upon which courtrooms stand. Some judges are trying to raise awareness and calling for action around the issue, but the process is just beginning.",
      "\u201cThe judiciary in general is aware that big changes are happening and want to understand AI, but I don\u2019t think anybody has figured out the full implications,\u201d Kolakowski told NBC News. \u201cWe\u2019re still dealing with a technology in its infancy.\u201d",
      "Prior to the Mendones case, courts have repeatedly dealt with a phenomenon billed as the \u201cLiar\u2019s Dividend,\u201d \u2014 when plaintiffs and defendants invoke the possibility of generative AI involvement to cast doubt on actual, authentic evidence. But in the Mendones case, the court found the plaintiffs attempted the opposite: to falsely admit AI-generated video as genuine evidence.",
      "Judge Stoney Hiljus, who serves in Minnesota\u2019s 10th Judicial District and is chair of the Minnesota Judicial Branch\u2019s AI Response Committee, said the case brings to the fore a growing concern among judges.",
      "\u201cI think there are a lot of judges in fear that they\u2019re going to make a decision based on something that\u2019s not real, something AI-generated, and it\u2019s going to have real impacts on someone\u2019s life,\u201d he said.",
      "Many judges across the country agree, even those who advocate for the use of AI in court. Judge Scott Schlegel serves on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal in Louisiana and is a leading advocate for judicial adoption of AI technology, but he also worries about the risks generative AI poses to the pursuit of truth.",
      "\u201cMy wife and I have been together for over 30 years, and she has my voice everywhere,\u201d Schlegel said. \u201cShe could easily clone my voice on free or inexpensive software to create a threatening message that sounds like it\u2019s from me and walk into any courthouse around the country with that recording.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe judge will sign that restraining order. They will sign every single time,\u201d said Schlegel, referring to the hypothetical recording. \u201cSo you lose your cat, dog, guns, house, you lose everything.\u201d",
      "Judge Erica Yew, a member of California\u2019s Santa Clara County Superior Court since 2001, is passionate about AI\u2019s use in the court system and its potential to increase access to justice. Yet she also acknowledged that forged audio could easily lead to a protective order and advocated for more centralized tracking of such incidents. \u201cI am not aware of any repository where courts can report or memorialize their encounters with deep-faked evidence,\u201d Yew told NBC News. \u201cI think AI-generated fake or modified evidence is happening much more frequently than is reported publicly.\u201d",
      "Yew said she is concerned that deepfakes could corrupt other, long-trusted methods of obtaining evidence in court. With AI, \u201csomeone could easily generate a false record of title and go to the county clerk\u2019s office,\u201d for example, to establish ownership of a car. But the county clerk likely will not have the expertise or time to check the ownership document for authenticity, Yew said, and will instead just enter the document into the official record.",
      "\u201cNow a litigant can go get a copy of the document and bring it to court, and a judge will likely admit it. So now do I, as a judge, have to question a source of evidence that has traditionally been reliable?\u201d Yew wondered.",
      "Though fraudulent evidence has long been an issue for the courts, Yew said AI could cause an unprecedented expansion of realistic, falsified evidence. \u201cWe\u2019re in a whole new frontier,\u201d Yew said.",
      "Schlegel and Yew are among a small group of judges leading efforts to address the emerging threat of deepfakes in court. They are joined by a consortium of the National Center for State Courts and the Thomson Reuters Institute, which has created resources for judges to address the growing deepfake quandary.",
      "The consortium labels deepfakes as \u201cunacknowledged AI evidence\u201d to distinguish these creations from \u201cacknowledged AI evidence\u201d like AI-generated accident reconstruction videos, which are recognized by all parties as AI-generated.",
      "Earlier this year, the consortium published a cheat sheet to help judges deal with deepfakes. The document advises judges to ask those providing potentially AI-generated evidence to explain its origin, reveal who had access to the evidence, share whether the evidence had been altered in any way and look for corroborating evidence.",
      "In April 2024, a Washington state judge denied a defendant\u2019s efforts to use an AI tool to clarify a video that had been submitted.",
      "Beyond this cadre of advocates, judges around the country are starting to take note of AI\u2019s impact on their work, according to Hiljus, the Minnesota judge.",
      "\u201cJudges are starting to consider, is this evidence authentic? Has it been modified? Is it just plain old fake? We\u2019ve learned over the last several months, especially with OpenAI\u2019s Sora coming out, that it\u2019s not very difficult to make a really realistic video of someone doing something they never did,\u201d Hiljus said. \u201cI hear from judges who are really concerned about it and who think that they might be seeing AI-generated evidence but don\u2019t know quite how to approach the issue.\u201d",
      "Hiljus is currently surveying state judges in Minnesota to better understand how generative AI is showing up in their courtrooms.",
      "To address the rise of deepfakes, several judges and legal experts are advocating for changes to judicial rules and guidelines on how attorneys verify their evidence. By law and in concert with the Supreme Court, the U.S. Congress establishes the rules for how evidence is used in lower courts.",
      "One proposal crafted by Maura R. Grossman, a research professor of computer science at the University of Waterloo and a practicing lawyer, and Paul Grimm, a professor at Duke Law School and former federal district judge, would require parties alleging that the opposition used deepfakes to thoroughly substantiate their arguments. Another proposal would transfer the duty of deepfake identification from impressionable juries to judges.",
      "The proposals were considered by the U.S. Judicial Conference\u2019s Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules when it conferred in May, but they were not approved. Members argued \u201cexisting standards of authenticity are up to the task of regulating AI evidence.\u201d The U.S. Judicial Conference is a voting body of 26 federal judges, overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court. After a committee recommends a change to judicial rules, the conference votes on the proposal, which is then reviewed by the Supreme Court and voted upon by Congress.",
      "Despite opting not to move the rule change forward for now, the committee was eager to keep a deepfake evidence rule \u201cin the bullpen in case the Committee decides to move forward with an AI amendment in the future,\u201d according to committee notes.",
      "Grimm was pessimistic about this decision given how quickly the AI ecosystem is evolving. By his accounting, it takes a minimum of three years for a new federal rule on evidence to be adopted.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s AI Action Plan, released in July as the administration\u2019s road map for American AI efforts, highlights the need to \u201ccombat synthetic media in the court system\u201d and advocates for exploring deepfake-specific standards similar to the proposed evidence rule changes.",
      "Yet other law practitioners think a cautionary approach is wisest, waiting to see how often deepfakes are really passed off as evidence in court and how judges react before moving to update overarching rules of evidence.",
      "Jonathan Mayer, the former chief science and technology adviser and chief AI officer at the U.S. Justice Department under President Joe Biden and now a professor at Princeton University, told NBC News he routinely encountered the issue of AI in the court system: \u201cA recurring question was whether effectively addressing AI abuses would require new law, including new statutory authorities or court rules.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe generally concluded that existing law was sufficient,\u201d he said. However, \u201cthe impact of AI could change \u2014 and it could change quickly \u2014 so we also thought through and prepared for possible scenarios.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, attorneys may become the first line of defense against deepfakes invading U.S. courtrooms.",
      "Judge Schlegel pointed to Louisiana\u2019s Act 250, passed earlier this year, as a successful and effective way to change norms about deepfakes at the state level. The act mandates that attorneys exercise \u201creasonable diligence\u201d to determine if evidence they or their clients submit has been generated by AI.",
      "\u201cThe courts can\u2019t do it all by themselves,\u201d Schlegel said. \u201cWhen your client walks in the door and hands you 10 photographs, you should ask them questions. Where did you get these photographs? Did you take them on your phone or a camera?\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t smell right, you need to do a deeper dive before you offer that evidence into court. And if you don\u2019t, then you\u2019re violating your duties as an officer of the court,\u201d he said.",
      "Daniel Garrie, co-founder of cybersecurity and digital forensics company Law & Forensics, said that human expertise will have to continue to supplement digital-only efforts.",
      "\u201cNo tool is perfect, and frequently additional facts become relevant,\u201d Garrie wrote via email. \u201cFor example, it may be impossible for a person to have been at a certain location if GPS data shows them elsewhere at the time a photo was purportedly taken.\u201d",
      "Metadata \u2014 or the invisible descriptive data attached to files that describe facts like the file\u2019s origin, date of creation and date of modification  \u2014 could be a key defense against deepfakes in the near future.",
      "For example, in the Mendones case, the court found the metadata of one of the purportedly-real-but-deepfaked videos showed that the plaintiffs\u2019 video was captured on an iPhone 6, which was impossible given that the plaintiff\u2019s argument required capabilities only available on an iPhone 15 or newer.",
      "Courts could also mandate that video- and audio-recording hardware include robust mathematical signatures attesting to the provenance and authenticity of their outputs, allowing courts to verify that content was recorded by actual cameras.",
      "Such technological solutions may still run into critical stumbling blocks similar to those that plagued prior legal efforts to adapt to new technologies, like DNA testing or even fingerprint analysis. Parties lacking the latest technical AI and deepfake know-how may face a disadvantage in proving evidence\u2019s origin.",
      "Grossman, the University of Waterloo professor, said that for now, judges need to keep their guard up.",
      "\u201cAnybody with a device and internet connection can take 10 or 15 seconds of your voice and have a convincing enough tape to call your bank and withdraw money. Generative AI has democratized fraud.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really moving into a new paradigm,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cInstead of trust but verify, we should be saying: Don\u2019t trust and verify.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Americans are going into 2026 more anxious about health care costs than at any other point in recent years, a new West Health-Gallup survey finds.",
      "Almost half of adults, 47%, say they\u2019re worried they won\u2019t be able to afford health care next year \u2014 the highest level since West Health and Gallup began tracking in 2021, the survey published Tuesday found.",
      "Concerns about prescription drug costs have climbed steadily, the survey found \u2014 rising from 30% in 2021 to 37% in 2025, also the highest level recorded. And the share of adults who say health care costs cause \u201ca lot of stress\u201d in their daily lives has nearly doubled since 2022, rising from 8% to 15%. The survey also found that about 1 in 3 adults reported delaying or skipping medical care over the last year because they couldn\u2019t afford it.",
      "The annual survey, conducted in June through August, was based on roughly 20,000 respondents across all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and asked 27 questions about people\u2019s health care experiences.",
      "Health care has become a central issue in politics. Senate Democrats\u2019 push to extend enhanced subsidies for the Affordable Care Act led to the longest government shutdown in history. The ACA tax credits, which have protected people from double-digit premium increases, are set to expire Dec. 31. Republicans blocked the effort, and the Trump administration has vowed to \u201cfix Obamacare\u201d but has yet to release a detailed plan.",
      "\u201cThe survey shows health care affordability isn\u2019t just a political debate, it\u2019s a problem many people are experiencing now,\u201d said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonpartisan research group. \u201cAmericans have been struggling to keep up with rising health costs generally and health care specifically.\u201d He wasn\u2019t involved in the survey.",
      "The survey didn\u2019t touch on the subsidies\u2019 expiring. Nor did it include questions about Medicaid work requirements that will go into effect in 2027.",
      "Taken together with the coverage losses that would follow, many people could face even greater challenges paying for health care in the years ahead, said Timothy Lash, president of West Health, a nonpartisan group that researches health care costs and aging.",
      "\u201cThe urgency around this is real,\u201d Lash said. \u201cWhen you look at the economic strain that is on families right now, even if health care prices didn\u2019t rise, the costs are rising elsewhere, which only exacerbates the problem.\u201d",
      "Lash said every metric in the survey has either held steady or gotten worse.",
      "\u201cAmericans are saying, \u2018Hey, now that I really think about it, I\u2019m paying too much and I\u2019m not getting enough,\u2019\u201d Lash said. \u201cHealth care is not what it needs to be right now.\u201d",
      "Differences across states",
      "How people experience health care varied greatly across states.",
      "Iowa, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., and Rhode Island ranked highest for overall health care experiences, particularly in how easily residents can afford, access and get health care when and where they need it.",
      "Texas, New Mexico, Nevada and Alaska ranked at the bottom of the list.",
      "While 66% of people in Nebraska \u2014 which ranked 10th overall \u2014 said it\u2019s easy to get the health care they need, just 30% in New Mexico and 31% in Nevada agreed.",
      "But even in the top-ranked states, many people still face difficulties, Lash said. About 15% of people in the top 10 states said they\u2019ve been unable to pay for prescription drugs in the past three months, compared with 29% in the bottom 10.",
      "About 25% of people in the top 10 states reported skipping recommended lab tests or medical procedures because of the cost over the last year, compared with 40% of people in the bottom 10.",
      "Skipping or forgoing medical care was most common in states like Texas (43% reported doing so), Montana (43%) and Alaska (41%), the survey found.",
      "Beyond cost, Americans cited other barriers that have restricted access to care. Nationally, 55% said long wait times prevented or delayed care, and 27% cited work schedules as a barrier.",
      "The top 10 and the bottom 10 states had similar shares of people who delayed or prevented care because they didn\u2019t know how to find providers: 25% and 31%, respectively.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the rankings ... we have to be very careful to say that someone won,\u201d Lash said. \u201cIt\u2019s like being the tallest kid in kindergarten and then suddenly walking outside the classroom and realizing, like, maybe you\u2019re not so tall after all.\u201d",
      "Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said the U.S. health care system is designed to make patients have \u201cskin in the game\u201d when it comes to paying for high health costs.",
      "\u201cWhile it\u2019s not surprising that states with high uninsurance rates \u2014 like Mississippi, which has not expanded Medicaid \u2014 have higher rates of cost problems than a state like Massachusetts, where I work,\u201d Gaffney wrote in an email, \u201ceven here in the Bay State large numbers experience cost worries due to inadequate insurance.\u201d",
      "Lawrence Gostin, director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said the findings may add pressure on Congress to extend the enhanced ACA subsidies before the end of the year.",
      "Even if they don\u2019t, he said, the pressure could intensify once Medicaid work requirements begin in 2027. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan government group, projects that 4.8 million people will lose coverage because of the work requirements.",
      "\u201cThe public has major anxiety about access to affordable health care,\u201d Gostin said. \u201cDeep concern and anxiety over health insurance premiums and medical bills is only likely to become more acute due to the lapse in ACA premium subsidies and major cuts to Medicaid.\u201d"

      "For one top Sotheby\u2019s executive, this year's auction season feels like destiny.",
      "\u201cThis is the season I\u2019ve waited for my whole life,\u201d Lisa Dennison told NBC News, standing near the radiant Gustav Klimt canvases soon to be auctioned.",
      "\u201cTo be in this building and to have the collections we have this season \u2014 it\u2019s everything,\u201d said Dennison, the auction house's executive vice president and chairman of the Americas.",
      "At the center of it all is one of the most anticipated art sales in the last several years: the private art collection of Leonard Lauder, the philanthropist, cosmetics heir and legendary collector who helped shape American museums \u2014 much like his mother, Est\u00e9e Lauder, shaped beauty culture as a giant of cosmetics.",
      "The works will be auctioned off beginning on Tuesday.",
      "Leonard Lauder, who grew up during the Great Depression, died in June at 92, leaving behind some of the most prized artworks in the world. The highlight of the 55 works that will be auctioned off is a painting that could shatter records: a full-length portrait by Austrian master Gustav Klimt, \u201cPortrait of Elisabeth Lederer,\u201d estimated to sell for more than $150 million.",
      "The portrait is historic not only for the high purchase price it is expected to bring, but for its rarity. There are only two full-length portraits by Klimt left in private hands. One is in a private collection that may never come on the market; the other is this one.",
      "Painted between 1914 and 1916, the portrait shows Lederer draped in an imperial Chinese robe, surrounded by Asian motifs and patterns. \u201cHe elevates her to almost mythical stature,\u201d Dennison said. \u201cThe sensitivity of the face and the richness of the robe \u2014 it\u2019s regal, transcendent and deeply modern.\u201d",
      "Emily Braun, Lauder\u2019s longtime curator, has held a front-row seat to one of the most remarkable art collectors of our time. Braun said Lauder had a natural eye, \u201cbut he knew he had to study more, to look, constantly and to learn.\u201d",
      "That drive began with him collecting Art Deco hotel postcards as a young boy in Miami, before he moved to wartime propaganda posters and finally to priceless paintings amassed throughout his lifetime. Lauder donated his entire collection of more than 100,000 postcards to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.",
      "At the Whitney Museum of American Art, where he started as a member and rose to chairman, Lauder helped the museum acquire 1,000 works \u2014 about one-tenth of its entire collection.",
      "\u201cHe cared deeply about quality and legacy,\u201d Dennison said. \u201cIf he believed in something, he wanted it to be the best of the best.\u201d (Lauder was once quoted as saying: \u201cOnly buy the best, don\u2019t be a bottom fisherman.\u201d)",
      "Sotheby\u2019s took over the former Whitney Museum on Manhattan's Madison Avenue and, since its grand opening on Nov. 8, the lines have been snaking around the block for a chance to see rare artworks about to be sold to the highest bidders from all over the world.",
      "Christina Dickerson, a San Francisco resident, comes from an art-collecting family and wanted to see the works in person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know many people who could amass a collection like this anymore, we\u2019re lucky to see it in one place, the sad part is it\u2019s going to go all over the place, and I truly hope some museums pick it up, so the general public can get to see the art again,\u201d Dickerson said.",
      "It remains to be seen whether or not collectors come and spend top dollar for these rare pieces. The art market has been in a slump recently. Sales in the international high-end art market declined 12% in 2024, according to the Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report.",
      "Lauder may be best known for donating his $1 billion collection of Cubist masterpieces to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",
      "Braun said Lauder\u2019s connection to Klimt was aesthetic, intellectual and deeply personal. Lauder, whose family had Hungarian and Czech heritage, started to collect Klimt\u2019s works in the 1970s. The paintings carried echoes of tragedy, Braun said: Lauder\u2019s wife, Evelyn, fled Vienna as a child because she was Jewish, so the painting's story \u201chad a multilayered meaning for him.\u201d",
      "For decades, the Elisabeth Lederer painting hung above his dining room table.",
      "\u201cPeople were terrified someone might back a chair into it ... but it was never going to happen,\u201d Braun said.",
      "Braun would not reveal how much Lauder paid for the masterpiece when he purchased it in 1985.",
      "In addition to the \u201cElisabeth Lederer,\u201d two more Klimt majestic landscapes are for sale, including \u201cBlooming Meadow,\u201d estimated at $80 million, created in 1906 at the height of his career, and \u201cForest Slope in Unteach,\u201d estimated at $70 million, painted in 1917. The latter shows a dense forest overlooking the Attersee lake in Austria.",
      "All three works remain in pristine condition \u2014 miraculous survivors of persecution, war, transit and time.",
      "Sotheby\u2019s will offer 24 works from Lauder\u2019s collection in Tuesday's sale, with an additional 30 pieces hitting the auction block on Wednesday.",
      "In addition to the Klimts, there will be glistening Matisse bronzes, Agnes Martin abstractions and a rare Edvard Munch.",
      "\u201cFor Leonard, collecting was never about ownership,\u201d Dennison said. \u201cIt was about preservation, education and beauty \u2014 and this sale is the ultimate expression of that.\u201d"

      "Then, for more than nine hours, Sald\u00edvar sat in her truck in the motel parking lot and threatened to commit suicide, the same court document states. After hours of conversation with a hostage negotiation team, she surrendered to police.",
      "A jury in Houston, Texas, found Sald\u00edvar guilty of first-degree murder on Oct. 23, 1995. Three days later, she was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years.",

      "In the series, Sald\u00edvar claimed she did not intentionally kill Selena and dismissed the long-held theory that she was embezzling money. Instead, Sald\u00edvar alleged that Selena was having an extramarital affair and tasked Sald\u00edvar with making purchases on her behalf to help cover up the tryst. Sald\u00edvar said she was simply paying herself back and that Selena was aware. But in the docuseries, Sald\u00edvar did not provide any evidence to substantiate her claims.",
      "\u201cAfter so many years, I think it\u2019s time to set the story straight,\u201d Sald\u00edvar said in a trailer for the series.",

    "story": [
      "Thirty years ago when Selena Quintanilla died, the world lost a rising star \u2014 and a groundbreaking artist.",
      "The Mexican American singer, known as the Queen of Tejano music, was just 23 years old when she was murdered by the president of her fan club and employee Yolanda Sald\u00edvar in 1995.",
      "The Texas native captivated audiences in the U.S. and Latin America with her hits \u201cComo La Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido\u201d and \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom.\u201d Her signature red lips, long black hair,  sultry voice and beloved dance moves have become iconic for fans of the late artist.",
      "Many who were unfamiliar with Selena during the height of her fame became aware of her extraordinary talent when Jennifer Lopez portrayed her in the 1997 biopic, \u201cSelena.\u201d",
      "Now, for the first time since Selena\u2019s death, her family is sharing never-before-seen footage from their archives of the superstar and her rise to fame in Netflix\u2019s \u201cSelena Y Los Dinos,\u201d streaming now.",
      "\u201cYou get to hear from Selena herself. We went through every single interview that we could find and that exists,\u201d director Isabel Castro tells TODAY.com. \u201cWe wanted to hear as much from Selena throughout the film as possible because we felt that, in that way, we would be telling the story in her voice.\u201d",
      "The documentary also includes interviews from her parents, Marcella and Abraham Quintanilla, sister Suzette Quintanilla, brother A.B. Quintanilla III, husband Chris P\u00e9rez, the bandmates who knew her best, and more.",
      "While many are familiar with the lead singer, the film chronicles how she started her career as part of her family's musical group Selena y Los Dinos. The band included her sister playing drums and her brother playing bass, backing vocals and writing songs, along with a slew of band members like Ricky Vela and Pete Astudillo. Her future husband later joined the group as a guitarist.",
      "\u201cI understand what Selena and her legacy represent even now, 30 years later,\u201d Suzette Quintanilla tells TODAY.com \u201cAnd I also know that's growing.\u201d",
      "Below, Suzette Quintanilla and Isabel Castro chat with TODAY.com about the decades of footage they combed through for this project \u2014 and the painful emotions and moments of joy that resurfaced after 30 years.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "Suzette Quintanilla: I had reached out to Isabel about two years ago or so. With social media, things get blurred, and stories get told one way \u2014 and then they start changing. I wanted to be able to take our family story and what we created as a whole... and bring it to 2025, leaving this really nice capsule of our story, told by \u2014 who better than our family?",
      "That\u2019s pretty much why I wanted to do this, and I thought maybe sharing some footage of us back in the day would be really good. Isabel has a fun story about how I let her into the vault. We call it the vault at the office, but it's basically where we keep all our footage.",
      "Isabel Castro: The vault is actually the perfect way to describe it, but it's floor to ceiling bookcases with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of VHS tapes, beta cam, film, CDs, flash drives.",
      "We spent two years going through all of that, logging everything, digitizing everything, watching every single thing. We watched every single piece of footage.",
      "SQ: I didn't feel differently. If anything, it gave me that good feeling of how life was. I was telling Isabel, like, \u201cOh, my God, I saw some of the footage, and I remember I was whistling when she bought those shoes\u201d or...different little key moments like clothing. Because we were sisters, we would shop a lot together.",
      "But what I did walk away with was, I had a really good feeling of like, \u201cWow, I know we worked really hard.\u201d It was a reminder of what we did come from, which was nothing, and that we created something memorable that still resonates with people. I\u2019m very grateful that our music is still relevant to this day.",
      "One of the things that I\u2019m really proud about this documentary is it truly tells and showcases the importance of each one of us and what we bring to our band. Yes, clearly Selena was a star and she was the forefront of our band. But there were other main factors that made our vision. I think that Isabel was able to really showcase the magnitude of what we each brought, and that\u2019s why we are here talking about our documentary.",
      "IC: That was one of the main goals of the film, to obviously explain how Selena became the symbol and the icon. But the film itself, I wanted it to feel as personal and as close to the family as possible, because my theory was that that was going to be what made it different from anything that had been made before. That was our North Star in the editorial process: to try to find ways to really make it as personal as possible.",
      "There's so many decisions that went into trying to cultivate that intimacy. We filmed people in spaces that they spent a lot of time in so they felt really comfortable. We didn't clean up the archive, we made sure that the edges and the glitches and the focusing of the camera and zooming in and out, those things were all kind of integrated into the editing process. And though these seem just like creative elements, they lend itself to the film feeling as if you're getting to know a more personal side of Selena.",
      "The other thing is that you get to hear from Selena herself. We went through every single interview that we could find and that exists. We transcribed every single interview and we wanted to hear as much from Selena throughout the film as possible because we felt that in that way, we would be telling the story in her voice as well.",
      "SQ: We\u2019ve never tried romanticizing anything about our life, I don\u2019t know if everybody else might have done that. But in regards to what we have always done is just kept it real. Isabel had so many things to go through to be able to create and integrate Selena into this film because that\u2019s the heart of this whole documentary. It\u2019s real. It\u2019s stripped down. There\u2019s no romanticizing going on. It\u2019s just who she was.",
      "What's relevant is, whenever you see an interview of her, she'll say something and she just starts laughing at herself. Most artists don\u2019t do that. They\u2019ll be like, \u201cNo, don\u2019t show that.\u201d And for her, she didn\u2019t care. It was just her being real. And I think that\u2019s one of the main beauties of this documentary. This is us talking about our life. We\u2019re not holding back, and I think that Isabel did an amazing job putting that all together and telling our story. And hopefully this will resonate for another 30, 40, years after I\u2019m no longer here. I hope it inspires.",
      "Another main reason is that I wanted to leave something behind. Selena was a beacon and I see her as that as well. People still look up to her and they admire her. I hope that after seeing this documentary, they walk away with that same mindset that their dream is attainable.",
      "SQ: I really don\u2019t know. That\u2019s kind of hard to say. I know that whatever she would have done, she would have been at the forefront of whatever she did. I think she would still be a beacon no matter whatever she did if she was still here and a complete role model. I do 100% believe if she was still here, she would be kicking ass in the design world and a designer.",
      "SQ: Every once in a while when I\u2019m in front of a live band, yeah, I want to play. But for the most part, I\u2019m at ease with that and I\u2019m fine with it because I keep myself so busy on the business side of everything. But I do miss it and I would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t.",
      "SQ: I\u2019m going to be very real with you. At the beginning, it was very, extremely difficult to live without her, hands down. I didn\u2019t think I would still be here, to be honest with you, that\u2019s how much grief took over. And then at one point I realized, after a couple of years of being in this mindset of feeling numb, so to speak, I realized that I needed to come out of it.",
      "I didn\u2019t go to therapy because back then, you know how (some) Mexican  (families) are. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in therapy.\u201d It\u2019s more like, \u201cCome and talk to your tia (aunt) type of therapy.\u201d But one thing I did is I prayed to God every day just to get me through that one day. That\u2019s it. Not the week, not the month, one day. And it just happened like that. And at one point, I started to let go of anger that I had in my heart for the person who took her life. Let go of things that I had no control over. Stay away from the \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d What if she was still here, what if she wouldn\u2019t have gone? What if? It doesn\u2019t matter because at the end of the day, the what ifs always brought me back around to the same thing: She is still not here.",
      "I went through this transition of healing my heart and my soul. It's still broken and it will forever be broken, and that's life. I'll probably go home, I\u2019ll go back to the hotel, probably have a good cry because I\u2019m going down memory lane today, but it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s a good cry and there\u2019s nothing wrong with crying here and there.",
      "I do miss her tremendously, but I'm in a place where we're celebrating not just Selena, but what we accomplished as a whole and as a family. That's what this documentary is about. I hope that my words resonate because what we can only do is celebrate the ones that are no longer with us anymore and keep their memory present."

      "Powell, who stars in the new film \u201cThe Running Man,\u201d made his \u201cSNL\u201d hosting debut Nov. 15 alongside musical guest Olivia Dean.",
      "During his opening monologue, Powell recalled how he was supposed to host the late-night sketch comedy show four years ago to promote \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d but his plans were thwarted by a pushed release date for the film.",
      "\u201cWhen I got the call, I was on a porch with my family and we all just lost our minds,\u201d Powell explained. \u201cWe were jumping up and down celebrating, and a UPS driver happened to be delivering a package at that exact same moment and he was like, \u2018What is going on?\u2019\u201d",
      "Powell explained to the UPS driver that he had gotten the call to host \u201cSNL\u201d and told the driver to tune in for the Christmas episode that season.",
      "\u201cAnd so we all took a selfie with him, and this is the selfie to mark the occasion,\u201d Powell said, before showing a photo posing with the UPS driver as well as his parents and sisters. \u201cSo that\u2019s me and my whole family and the UPS driver.\u201d",
      "However, Powell said his \u201cdream got taken away\u201d after the \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d release was delayed due to the pandemic, and \u201cSNL\u201d rescinded the offer for him to host.",
      "Powell joked that the show\u2019s creator and producer, Lorne Michaels, called him and told him that without \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d nobody \u201cwill know who the eff you are.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo, I didn\u2019t end up hosting, which means for four years, this UPS driver was just going around saying Glen Powell is a liar,\u201d Powell said. \u201cSo now, I am here hosting. It feels amazing. But what feels even better is proving to this UPS driver that I am not crazy.\u201d",
      "In a surprise twist, Powell then shared that his sisters, Lauren and Leslie, were able to track down the UPS driver, joking that the women in his family \u201care terrifying.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey found the cell number of this UPS guy, his name is Mitch,\u201d Powell said. \u201cSo to prove to Mitch that I am not a liar, I flew him all the way to New York \u2014 coach, I don\u2019t know how \u2018The Running Man\u2019 is going to do yet \u2014 but I flew him here, and he thought it was a scam, but he still came. And he is sitting in the audience tonight, so let\u2019s give it up for Mitch, the UPS guy.\u201d",
      "The camera panned to Mitch sitting in the audience as he gave a wave to the camera. Powell then invited Mitch onto the stage of Studio 8H to re-create that original selfie and \u201cbring this thing full circle.\u201d",
      "While this marked Powell\u2019s first time hosting the late-night sketch comedy show, the actor made two brief appearances in March 2024 during his \u201cAnyone But You\u201d co-star Sydney Sweeney\u2019s hosting debut.",
      "During her monologue, Sweeney called out the \u201ccraziest rumor\u201d she\u2019d heard about herself online, which was that she and Powell had an affair while they filmed the 2023 rom-com. Sweeney refuted the rumors and said her then-fianc\u00e9, Jonathan Davino, produced the movie and he was with the duo the entire time during filming.",
      "Sweeney added that Davino was in the audience to show his support. But the cameras cut to Powell smiling in the audience, leaving Sweeney to yell, \u201cThat\u2019s not my fianc\u00e9! He\u2019s in my dressing room!\u201d",
      "Powell also appeared during a sketch called \u201cLoud Table,\u201d which featured Sweeney on a date with her boyfriend, played by Andrew Dismukes. However, during the date, Sweeney confessed she cheated on him with her boss, played by none other than Powell."

      "Season 2 of \u201cThe Golden Bachelor\u201d began with 23 women looking to find a soulmate in their golden years and hoping that it was Mel, a 66-year-old former NFL player who now works as a lawyer.",

      "After leaving, Cindy wept alone and said she thought Mel was her match. \"I was so hopeful,\" she said. \"It hurts really bad.\"",
      "Mel, meanwhile, said that he was \"shocked\" by Cindy's departure. \"I came into tonight thinking there was a future, but she quit,\" he said.",
      "During the \"After the Final Rose\" event, Cindy said she didn't feel like she should have to \"convince a man to love her,\" to applause from the audience.",
      "Mel then spoke to Peg the next day and explained that he wasn't ready to \"commit\" to a proposal. That, she said, made her nervous, but she moved forward with meeting Mel's two sons and his college friend. The meeting went well, with consensus across the board that they were a good match.",
      "Mel ultimately gave Peg a promise ring. \"I trusted you. You trusted me. You told me you had confidence in me that I'd make the right choice \u2014 and here you are,\" he said, before showing a ring.",

      "\"One thing I can say about Mel: He doesn't have integrity. He is integrity. Let that sink in. That's one thing I love about him,\" she said.",
      "Mel said the relationship has progressed \"very, very well\" since the show ended. They both said they are in love with each other.",
      "\"It worked!\" host Jesse Palmer said.",
      "CORRECTION (11/13 at 1:25 p.m.): This article originally stated that Mel proposed to Peg. In fact, he gave her a promise ring."

    "story": [
      "Whether viewed as a visionary reformist or a murderous despot, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader, will be taking a huge step toward rejoining the international community when he meets with President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday.",
      "Bin Salman, 40, became an international pariah after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a fierce critic of his government, in 2018, though Trump defended the Saudi government even after the CIA concluded that the crown prince himself ordered the killing.",
      "Then-President Joe Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2022 and controversially fist-bumped bin Salman, an image that went viral, at a time when most leaders had shunned the crown prince. Bin Salman said in 2019 that he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the Khashoggi killing since it happened on his watch, but denied ordering it.",
      "But it is bin Salman\u2019s trip Tuesday, his first during Trump\u2019s second term, that will be seen more broadly as a move toward acceptance back into the diplomatic fold.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a different kind of figure now. Obviously, the questions about the manner of his rule and internal repression, those things haven\u2019t gone away. But he\u2019s a changed figure; it\u2019s a changed moment. And, I think, important symbolically in that sense,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a global nonprofit organization based in Brussels that works to prevent conflicts.",
      "He added: \u201cHe\u2019s central to what this administration wants to do in the region.\u201d",
      "Trump and bin Salman are expected to sign economic and defense agreements, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "Even before bin Salman had set foot in the United States, Trump confirmed at an Oval Office event Monday that he would be willing to sign off on the sale of F-35 stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, a contentious move that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East, where Israel has been the primary recipient of America\u2019s cutting-edge military technology.",
      "Trump\u2019s announcement of the sale may not actually lead to Saudi Arabia\u2019s receiving the F-35s anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe devil will kind of be in the details there,\u201d said Andrew Leber, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has done extensive research on Saudi Arabia, noting that a similar deal announced with the United Arab Emirates fell through.",
      "He added, \u201cThat deal ultimately ran aground on a combination of U.S. concerns with maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge and concerns about the extent to which U.S. security technology might leak to China.\u201d",
      "The possibility of Saudi Arabia\u2019s normalizing relations with Israel will be a key part of the talks, according to the White House official. The official said Trump \u201chopes\u201d the kingdom will soon join the Abraham Accords, the 2020 U.S.-brokered agreement that led a number of regional countries to establish formal diplomatic ties with Israel, though analysts are skeptical about a breakthrough.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no near-term horizon for normalization at the moment,\u201d said Hanna of the ICG.",
      "\"The risks for Mohammed bin Salman are extremely high if he joins the Abraham Accords,\" agreed Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. He noted that the Saudis had made clear they would need some form of Israeli commitment to a path to a Palestinian state \u2014 something the Israelis have publicly dismissed.",
      "The crown prince's strategy was generally \"to minimize the risks to his rule,\" said Gerges.",
      "Even if bin Salman does not announce the establishment of diplomatic ties with Israel, he has won favor with Trump as one of the regional leaders who helped pull together the current ceasefire between the Israel Defense Forces and the militants of Hamas.",
      "Trump has long touted his deal-making abilities, and, according to a senior administration official, a number of deals are expected to be announced Tuesday, including a multibillion-dollar Saudi investment in America\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and fulfillment of the Saudis\u2019 $600 billion investment pledge via dozens of targeted investments.",
      "Critics have raised questions about Trump\u2019s affinity for mixing personal business and diplomacy. His properties have for years hosted tournaments for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. And The New York Times reported this weekend that the Trump Organization is looking at a huge real estate deal with Saudi Arabia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some massive ethical questions in here,\u201d said Leber of the Carnegie Endowment. \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that all of the Gulf states have realized that the way you get to Trump is to find some way to enrich his family members, enrich his friends, promise to enrich them down the line.\u201d",
      "Governments dealing with Saudi Arabia, human rights groups have long said, should also push the country\u2019s leaders on its dismal human rights record. In August, a report from Human Rights Watch noted an \u201cunprecedented surge\u201d in executions in 2025, with 241 people killed as of Aug. 5.",
      "Still, the restrictions on women, another regular criticism leveled at the kingdom, have been eased, and bin Salman has tried to open up the society to Western exports, like Ultimate Fighting Championship matches and comedy shows, though the comedians who recently appeared at a comedy festival in Riyadh, including Louis C.K. and Bill Burr, were blasted for performing there.",
      "\u201cThis hasn\u2019t been political reform in the sense of creating space for real politics, but he\u2019s absolutely, fundamentally reoriented Saudi society and changed the role of the religious authorities,\u201d said Hanna of the ICG. \u201cThere\u2019s incredible social change that has happened partly because he\u2019s operating without any real constraints.\""

      "RIGA, Latvia \u2014 In a nondescript factory on the edge of Latvia\u2019s capital, a small team is trying to solve a continental-sized problem: How can Europe protect itself from swarms of Russian attack drones?",
      "Used on an almost nightly basis in the war in Ukraine, a spate of mysterious drone incursions above airports and sensitive sites has also highlighted Europe\u2019s vulnerability to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and sparked alarm that NATO nations are unprepared to defend themselves from the cheap but effective weaponry.",
      "As a result, European leaders have backed plans for a \u201cdrone wall,\u201d a network of sensors and weapons to detect, track and neutralize intruding UAVs, and in Riga, the team at a small tech company called Origin is on the forefront of this new, high-tech battleground.",
      "Its solution, a 3-foot-tall interceptor drone named \u201cBlaze.\u201d Powered by an artificial intelligence system, it has been trained to recognize a hostile target and navigate close to it. It will then alert a human operator, who will make a decision on whether to intercept and push a button which explodes a 28-ounce warhead, self-destructing the drone and hopefully bringing down its target too.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t fly these systems. These systems fly themselves,\u201d Origin  CEO Agris Kipurs told NBC News last week in an interview outside the factory, adding that Blaze addressed \u201cthe problem of relatively cheap, low-flying threats that are deployed in volumes.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s Gaza peace plan was passed by a majority vote at the United Nations on Monday, though world powers were still divided over whether it can convert a fragile ceasefire into the long-term solution that has eluded the Middle East.",
      "Much about the plan remains uncertain, with occasional outbreaks of violence between Israel and Hamas threatening the tenuous diplomacy at every turn and Palestinians inside Gaza suffering hunger and now flooding at the onset of a bitter winter.",
      "The fraught path was made clear even before the delegates took to their desks, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 under pressure from his far-right coalition partners \u2014 denouncing the resolution's outlining of a future Palestinian state. Hamas also warned against the U.S. proposal.",
      "The Security Council adopted the plan with 13 votes in favor, zero votes against and two abstentions, Russia and China.",
      "\"Today\u2019s resolution represents another significant step towards a stable Gaza that will be able to prosper, and an environment that will allow Israel to live in security,\" Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said after the vote.",
      "Designed to usher Gaza from rubble-strewn war zone into a new era, the resolution backs establishing a \u201cBoard of Peace,\u201d headed by the president himself, to temporarily govern the territory. Alongside that, an International Stabilization Force, known as the ISF, would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "The proposal would be \u201cphase two\u201d of Trump\u2019s 20-point plan first announced in September, \u201cphase one\u201d of which brought a prisoner and hostage exchange, as well as a ceasefire that has largely held despite accusations of violations from both sides.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed at least 69,000 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to local health officials. Israel launched it after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist, attack in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 more were kidnapped.",
      "Some Security Council members objected that the U.S. resolution made no reference of Palestinian statehood, according to The Associated Press. The draft now says that after the Palestinian Authority has \u201cfaithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,\u201d the AP reported.",
      "The resolution supporting the U.S. plan is backed by Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other Arab states, as well as Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan.

      "The designation, set to take effect on Nov. 24, puts the cartel among the likes of Hamas and the Islamic State group. It allows the U.S. government to seize its assets and makes it unlawful to provide \u201cmaterial support\u201d to the group.",

      "As of Friday evening, Trump had not signed off on strikes on land, but that could change, the officials said. The military options are ready for him, and the United States has assets in the region now, so if he decides to move forward with strikes, they can begin quickly, the officials said.",
      "The strikes have generated controversy in Congress, as Democrats and some Republicans paint the administration's moves as heavy-handed overreach that circumvents lawmakers.",

The Senate this month voted down a similar resolution that would require the president to obtain congressional approval for any military action against Venezuela.",

Had she known about the efforts to free the birds ahead of time, Gibbon said, she would not have come. \u201cThe aquarium is saying it\u2019s meeting the standards, but we can always improve those standards,\u201d she added.",
      "Dozens of British lawmakers have signed an open letter to Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds asking her to \u201cconsider whether the penguins should be relocated to a more suitable facility better aligned with their behavioral, ecological and physiological needs,\u201d according to British media reports.",
      "David Taylor, a member of Parliament with the ruling Labour Party, has been spearheading the campaign, posting on X that \u201cabusing animals for money is un-British.\u201d",
      "The largest populations of gentoo penguins are found in the Falkland Islands and the South Georgia Islands in the South Atlantic, and on the Antarctic Peninsula, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "Rory Wilson, a professor of aquatic biology at Swansea University in the United Kingdom, told NBC News that in the wild, gentoo penguins routinely dive up to more than 160 feet deep.",
      "\u201cI know that the official guidelines for captive penguins is that they need at least 4 feet of water depth, which I don\u2019t know who thought of that. It clearly wasn\u2019t someone who thought much about penguins,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are monstrously efficient, wonderful swimmers. They are one of the fastest penguins, most athletic, and therefore any condition that they are being kept in captivity, which constrains their ability to move themselves, is obviously of concern,\u201d he said.",
      "As far as fresh air and daylight are concerned, Wilson said, some subspecies of gentoo could struggle to survive outside in the U.K. due to a risk of fungal infections.",
      "Freedom for Animals, a U.K. charity that opposes the captivity of animals in \u201czoos, aquariums, mobile zoos and circuses,\u201d launched a campaign to free the penguins in February 2024, but the movement has picked up steam with a protest held outside the facility last month and the intervention from MPs.",
      "A petition started by the charity has garnered more than 40,000 signatures and asks theme park operator Merlin Entertainments, which owns the aquarium, to guarantee the \u201csafe and permanent retirement of the penguins\u201d to a facility that can provide \u201ca much more suitable environment.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Merlin Entertainments said the penguin enclosure is located on the ground floor of the aquarium, not the basement, and was \u201ccarefully designed to reflect important elements of the penguins\u2019 natural environment as closely as possible to ensure good health, including climate-controlled temperature and filtered fresh air.\u201d",
      "The company also said the enclosure has technology that creates appropriate seasonal lighting, reflecting changing seasons. The penguin colony is regularly inspected by independent veterinarians, and local and national authorities, it added.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex issue,\u201d its statement said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to consider, and we take every decision seriously, always guided by what\u2019s best for the animals. We\u2019re open. We\u2019re listening. And we\u2019ve always done what\u2019s right for our animals based on expert advice and their individual needs. That\u2019s a commitment we stand by.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Military threats, summoned ambassadors and even references to beheading: China and Japan are locked in a furious diplomatic spat over Taiwan, with Beijing unleashing language that is far from diplomatic.",
      "The Chinese outrage is directed at Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who told lawmakers last week that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a military response from Tokyo, an unusually explicit statement that experts say is a first for a sitting Japanese prime minister.",
      "China, which claims the self-ruling island democracy as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force against it, has demanded that Takaichi retract her \u201cegregious\u201d remarks.",
      "Others have gone further: One prominent Chinese commentator called Takaichi an \u201cevil witch,\u201d while a Chinese diplomat in Japan talked about cutting off the \u201cdirty neck\u201d extending itself into what Beijing considers an internal matter.",
      "Both countries have summoned each other\u2019s ambassadors as the saga enters its second week, and on Friday China advised its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan, citing \"significant risks\" to their personal safety.",
      "The war of words underscores the complicated relationship between China and Japan, which are major trading partners but have modern territorial disputes as well as lasting historical tensions over Japan\u2019s World War II-era occupation of China.",
      "It was only two weeks ago that Takaichi, who last month became Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a regional summit in South Korea, during which they agreed to pursue stable ties.",
      "Like its ally the United States, Japan has traditionally been vague as to how far it would go to protect Taiwan \u2014 which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory \u2014 against Chinese military aggression.",
      "But Takaichi, a China hard-liner who has long advocated for Taiwan, told lawmakers last week that Chinese use of force around Taiwan could qualify as \u201can existential threat,\u201d triggering a military response.",
      "Though former Japanese leaders \u2014 including Takaichi\u2019s mentor, the late Shinzo Abe \u2014 have made similar comments about military action after leaving office, \u201cit\u2019s breaking new ground for a sitting prime minister to state this,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News.",
      "The reaction from China was strong and swift, with one comment in particular getting the most attention.",
      "\u201cThe dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,\u201d Xue Jian, the Chinese consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, said in a post on X that has since been deleted.",
      "The Japanese government says it continues to favor a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue and has criticized Xue\u2019s \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d remarks, which some interpreted as a death threat against Takaichi.",
      "The U.S. ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has also weighed in on Xue\u2019s comments. \u201cTime for Beijing to behave like the \u2018good neighbor\u2019 it talks repeatedly about \u2014 but fails repeatedly to become,\u201d he said in a post on X.",
      "On Friday, Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to Japan, Wu Jianghao, to lodge a protest over Xue\u2019s post.",
      "China said later Friday that Wu had himself \u201csummoned Japan\u2019s Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Takehiro Funakoshi, to lodge solemn representations\u201d and assail Takaichi for failing to retract her comments, which it said \u201cviolated basic common sense, crossed China\u2019s red line, constituted a military threat, and amounted to war-mongering.\u201d",
      "A day earlier, Beijing summoned the Japanese ambassador, Kenji Kanasugi, to warn him over Taiwan.",
      "The Chinese Ministry of National Defense also issued a warning on Friday, saying that Japan would \u201cinevitably crash against the steel wall\u201d of the Chinese military if it intervenes in the Taiwan Strait, \u201cpaying a bitter and heavy price.\u201d",
      "Takaichi has also been excoriated in Chinese state media. A Friday editorial in the People\u2019s Daily newspaper said the Taiwan remarks by Takaichi, who has vowed to increase defense spending and favors revising Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution, were \u201caimed at finding an excuse for Japan\u2019s military expansion.\u201d",
      "Hu Xijin, a Chinese nationalist commentator, said Takaichi was an \u201cevil witch\u201d who had \u201csuccessfully ignited a new explosion of mutual hatred between Chinese and Japanese public opinion.\u201d",
      "Taiwan, which was ruled by China\u2019s Qing dynasty from 1683 to 1895 and by Japan from 1895 to 1945, has emphasized its sovereignty and noted Beijing\u2019s escalating military activity in the Taiwan Strait.",
      "China\u2019s warnings to Japan \u201cunderscore its hegemonic mindset and demonstrate that it is a troublemaker intent on unilaterally changing the international order,\u201d the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said this week.",
      "None of this may matter all that much to Takaichi, who was expected to clash with Beijing on Taiwan and other issues.",
      "China\u2019s harsh response will only \u201cenhance her reputation\u201d among conservatives in Japan, Kingston said. It could also give her a boost with President Donald Trump, who seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during his visit to Japan last month.",
      "\u201cTaking a hard line on China doesn\u2019t really hurt her in terms of bilateral relations with the United States,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Because China is so sensitive to the issue of Taiwan, which it describes as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d its rebuke of Takaichi\u2019s comments is also unsurprising, said Richard McGregor, senior fellow for East Asia at the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy think tank in Australia.",
      "And while Takaichi wants to be seen as firm on national security, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that she wants a confrontation with China,\u201d he said in an interview Friday in Hong Kong.",
      "So for all the tense exchanges her Taiwan remarks have brought between the two Asian powers, McGregor said, \u201cit\u2019s not a cataclysmic event.\u201d",
      "Kingston agreed.",
      "Takaichi \u201cwent out of her way to be provocative,\u201d he said, \u201cand China responded as expected.\u201d"

      "Zhu Rikun spent months planning a film festival that never happened.",
      "As the director of the inaugural IndieChina Film Festival, Zhu was set to welcome filmmakers and directors from China to New York City for a small showcase of independent Chinese films this week, but he said concerns over harassment led to the event\u2019s suspension two days before it was scheduled to start on Nov. 8.",
      "Every day this week, Zhu has been showing up to the empty venue he had booked for the film festival as a form of protest.",
      "\u201cIt was not the film festival that I prepared for,\u201d the filmmaker told NBC News on Friday morning.",
      "In a statement ahead of the film festival\u2019s cancellation, the organizer said he received messages saying that filmmakers, directors and producers from China set to participate in the event, as well as their relatives, were facing harassment.",
      "Many participants who pulled out of the independent film festival did not say why or cited \u201cpersonal reasons,\u201d but a few said they or their family members had been told to do so by Chinese authorities, according to Zhu.",
      "\u201cI hope this announcement of the cancellation of IndieChina Film Festival will make certain unknown forces stop harassing all the directors, guests, former staff, volunteers and my friends and family,\u201d Zhu said in a statement on the festival\u2019s website.",
      "By the time Zhu suspended the film festival, it was too late for him to cancel the venue he had booked. Throughout the week, he has gone to the event space \u2014 sometimes by himself or with a handful of other filmmakers \u2014 to watch some films and discuss them.",
      "\u201cI am still a filmmaker. I\u2019m still a filmmaker from China and I\u2019m still an independent film curator,\u201d Zhu said, adding that independent filmmaking in China \u201cis really difficult; it is extremely different from before.\u201d",
      "Before moving to New York City a decade ago, Zhu had worked on independent film festivals in China for nearly 20 years and co-founded the Beijing Independent Film Festival.",
      "But independent film festivals in China began facing increasing crackdowns after Chinese President Xi Jinping, known for his stringent ideological control, stepped into power in 2012, according to Human Rights Watch. The nongovernmental organization investigating human rights abuses around the world has said that Chinese authorities have shut down all three major independent film festivals in China, including Zhu\u2019s Beijing Independent Film Festival.",
      "\u201cEventually, all of my film festivals were banned, none of them could continue,\u201d Zhu said.",
      "Following what happened to his film festival in Beijing, Zhu had been rethinking how to host a film festival focused on Chinese independent films that could avoid censorship \u2014 the New York City event was the first attempt at that.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government reached around the globe to shut down a film festival in New York City,\u201d Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cThis latest act of transnational repression demonstrates the Chinese government\u2019s aim to control what the world sees and learns about China.\u201d",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to an NBC News email seeking comment.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry told The New York Times this week that it wasn\u2019t familiar with the specific circumstances around the IndieChina Film Festival and that Human Rights Watch had \u201clong been prejudiced against China.\u201d"

      "It\u2019s a routine millions of Ukrainians have been begrudgingly following since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion almost four years ago, and the nearly nightly barrages of Ukrainian cities that have followed.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Intelligence \u201cis not for killing,\u201d Colombian President Gustavo Petro told NBC News in a wide-ranging interview Wednesday, explaining his decision to stop sharing information with the United States in opposition to lethal strikes on boats allegedly carrying illegal drugs.",
      "Describing President Donald Trump as a \u201cbarbarian\u201d who \u201cwants to frighten us,\u201d Petro, a former Marxist revolutionary and one of the few international leaders willing to openly criticize his American counterpart, called the U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean \u201cundoubtedly an aggression against Latin America.\u201d",
      "Colombia would not \u201cpass on the information because we would be collaborating with a crime against humanity,\u201d he told NBC News at the presidential palace in Bogota, reiterating a decision announced earlier this week.",
      "Acknowledging \u201cthe most key thing is intelligence\u201d in combating the drug trade, he added, \u201cThe more we coordinate intelligence, the better. That is what I have been doing. But intelligence is not for killing.\u201d",
      "Tensions have risen dramatically between Trump and Petro in recent weeks over the issue of American military attacks against boats allegedly carrying illegal narcotics in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, which have killed dozens. At least 19 strikes have been carried out so far, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump has justified them by saying the United States is in \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels and claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations that are flooding America\u2019s cities with drugs.",
      "But his administration has provided no evidence for these assertions and lawmakers, including Republicans, have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the strikes.",
      "A White House official said in an email Thursday that it was \u201chardly surprising\u201d that Petro was opposed to Trump\u2019s \u201csuccessful operations to halt the flow of drugs to our country.\u201d They added that Trump had directed the actions \u201cconsistent with his responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars invested in Colombia\u2019s counterdrug efforts, cartels are thriving under Petro\u2019s failed policies,\u201d they said.",
      "Trump called Petro an \u201cillegal drug leader\u201d on Truth Social last month, accusing him of being directly involved in the drug trade and working with traffickers.",
      "After Petro called a U.S. strike \u201cmurder\u201d in a post on X, Trump said he would cut aid and raise tariffs on Colombia. The Treasury Department subsequently hit his Colombian counterpart and members of his family with sanctions.",
      "Petro then announced this week that he was suspending intelligence sharing with Washington.",
      "The United Kingdom has also stopped sharing intelligence because of concerns about the legality of U.S. strikes, two sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.",
      "And French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also said at the start of a a Group of Seven foreign ministers meeting in Canada on Tuesday that the strikes \u201cviolate international law\u201d and were concerning for France\u2019s territories in the region.",
      "Petro did not say definitively that the boats that have been recently attacked were not carrying drugs. \u201cMaybe or maybe not. We do not know,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to due process, the civilized treatment of people, they \u200bshould be seized and detained.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are poor boatmen, they know how to drive a boat, they are hired in their poverty by the gangsters. But gangsters don\u2019t sit on the boats,\u201d he said. \u201cThen when one of those missiles arrives [it] kills that boatman. It doesn\u2019t kill the drug trafficker.\u201d",
      "His government, he said, \u201chas seized more cocaine than any other government in world history. Trump\u2019s insult is at odds reality, how can he call the largest destroyer of cocaine a chief trafficker?\u201d",
      "Petro strongly denied Trump\u2019s personal accusations, calling the president \"lost\" and suggesting that he was being misled by other U.S. officials on the issue. \u201cHe is lost on the issue of the real analysis of what is going on with cocaine in Colombia.\u201d",
      "Petro, who considers himself a left-wing revolutionary, added, \u201cHe is a barbarian, but anyone can change.\u201d",
      "The Colombian president is not the only leader in the region feeling pressure. Trump has also singled out the president of neighboring Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, as a target for his ire and leveled accusations of complicity in the drug trade against him, too.",
      "The tense standoff between the U.S. and Venezuela escalated after Trump sent an aircraft carrier strike group to the Caribbean and confirmed he had approved covert CIA operations inside the country, a move that critics say could be a prelude to an attempt to push Maduro from office.",
      "Trump has not confirmed any covert actions against Colombia yet and Petro struck a defiant tone about Trump\u2019s recent regional moves and the potential for war.",
      "\u201cHe wants to frighten us. Fear is not the same as the facts,\u201d Petro said, though he did not throw his support behind Maduro, either.",
      "Asked whether Maduro was a legitimate leader, Petro said, \u201cNo, I believe that there has been no legitimate leadership for some time.\u201d",
      "Richard Engel, Marc Smith and Erika Angulo reported from Bogota. Babak Dehghanpisheh reported from New York."
