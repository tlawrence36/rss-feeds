      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit are coming back to the small screen",
      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit have been stars since the beginning.",
      "In the 35 years since Nick Park introduced the world to his stop-motion creations and their eccentric, unapologetically British existence, they\u2019ve won Oscars, appeared in commercials, video games, animated series and even the occasional bit of (unofficial) protest art. Feature films, however, have been few and far between. Part of the reason is the difficulty: Even a 30-minute short can take upward of two years. Besides, why mess with a formula that\u2019s produced only classics?",
      "After working on the pair\u2019s first feature, \u201cWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d which was released in 2005 and won an Oscar, and \u201cEarly Man,\u201d Park even doubted that he\u2019d dabble in the form again. But sometimes inspiration requires a little more breathing room: That's how the second \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d feature film, \u201cVengeance Most Fowl,\u201d came to be. It debuts on Netflix worldwide, except in the U.K., on Friday.",
      "Gnomes have always been part of Wallace and Gromit\u2019s world. After \u201cThe Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d Park started kicking around an idea about a smart gnome, Norbot, built to help Gromit in the garden.",
      "\u201cThere was something a bit missing,\u201d Park said. \u201cWe tinkered around with the story on and off for years and it seemed to be lacking the more sinister element that\u2019s often in \u2018Wallace & Gromit.\u2019 Why do the gnomes go wrong? Who was the motivated villain?\u201d",
      "Five years ago, the solution came to them: Feathers McGraw, the conniving penguin with a penchant for heists and simple disguises, who turned their lives to chaos in \u201cThe Wrong Trousers.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was the answer to everything,\u201d Park said. \u201cThe story got bigger and more exciting. Suddenly it became a feature-length film.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Park and his co-director Merlin Crossingham often heard fan requests to bring Feathers back.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d been very noncommittal about it because characters haven\u2019t in the past come back,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cBut when we did drop a little teaser trailer, we were completely bowled over by the response. At that point, we were still making the film and it kind of gave us a boost and that confidence that it was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "They needed it too since Feathers McGraw, like a true diva, was by far the most difficult puppet to animate, direct and light \u2014 this in a movie that has chase sequences, special effects and an army of evil gnomes. The simplicity of his design, and the fact that he doesn\u2019t speak, gave them no room to hide. In fact, in their world-class group of animators at Aardman, Park said only five volunteered to work on Feathers.",
      "\u201cAll the filmmaking tricks have to come together very well to make Feathers have that screen presence that we needed from him,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "Part of the charm of the \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d films is their unabashed Britishness, which the filmmakers have had to fight (politely) to preserve as their audience has become more and more global. While Netflix was largely supportive, they did have a bit of a back and forth over the turn of phrase \u201cFlippin\u2019 Nora!\u201d (They ultimately kept it.)",
      "\u201cA lot of the stuff in the films is inspired by stuff we grew up with, the design of things, little products,\u201d Park said.",
      "He was particularly happy to include a \u201chigh-speed\u201d barge chase on the canals and a joke about police at the Yorkshire border \u2014 melding uniquely British references with big Hollywood movie tropes.",
      "\u201cI think all of it is a sort of a lovely homage to Britishness and not in a patriotic way, just kind of laughing at ourselves culturally,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "The starting point for all scenes was always the traditional: In camera, stop-motion animation like they\u2019ve been using since 1989. It is, Crossingham said, fundamentally vital to the films to see the thumbprints on the characters and know that they're handmade.",
      "There have always been limitations, and the option to use more digital assistance, but it\u2019s only been in recent years that computer graphics have caught up enough to blend in. Effects like fog and steam are possible in stop-motion, but, they explained, they never look quite right.",
      "\u201cThe main thing we required was that if we were going to use a digital technique, could we force it to look right for our film rather than it just being bolted on and feeling like an accessory that was a bit of an unwelcome guest,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cThe visual effects department at Aardman worked very hard to get that stylizing so that it felt right in \u2018Wallace and Gromit,\u2019 in which and the sets and the props are characters in themselves.\u201d",
      "The tension between embracing technological innovation like artificial intelligence and preserving the old ways that still work was not just something they were thinking about off-camera. It\u2019s at the heart of the film too, as Wallace\u2019s well-intentioned invention turns against him (and wreaks havoc on the town).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit meta,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that resonates with audiences with stop-motion that they can tell it\u2019s handcrafted, they can tell that\u2019s the human touch.\u201d",
      "Park said he used to worry about the future of stop-motion, wondering how much time they had left. Recently, though, he\u2019s seen a resurgence.",
      "\u201cAs long as we\u2019re telling good stories, entertaining and compelling stories with compelling characters, we\u2019ll keep going,\u201d he said.",

      "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer said Monday, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.",
      "Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed to The Associated Press that the couple had come to a deal. News of the settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "\u201cMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt,\u201d Simon said in a statement. \u201cShe and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\u201d",
      "No court documents have been filed yet, and a judge will need to sign off on the agreement. An email late Monday night to Pitt's attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood\u2019s most prominent couples for 12 years. The two Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A judge in 2019 declared them divorced and single, but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.",
      "A private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon after that included equal custody of their children, but Jolie filed to have him removed from the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start over.",
      "No details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couple's use of the private judge \u2014 an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years \u2014 has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. Some details, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt, in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect that lawsuit."

      "Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas. But, nearly two months after its release, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a film about a family torn apart by the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades, has drawn millions of moviegoers across the South American country.",
      "The film's domestic box office success \u2014 with nearly 3 million tickets sold, it secured the fifth spot at the 2024 box office by mid December \u2014 is rooted in its exploration of a long-neglected national trauma, but it is particularly timely, especially as Brazil confronts a recent near-miss with democratic rupture.",
      "Set in the 1970s and based on true events, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d tells the story of the Paivas, an upper-class family in Rio de Janeiro shattered by the dictatorship. Rubens Paiva, a former leftist congressman, was taken into custody by the military in 1971 and was never seen again. The narrative centers on his wife, Eunice Paiva, and her lifelong pursuit of justice.",
      "The film was nominated for a Golden Globe for best foreign language film and shortlisted for the Oscars in the same category.",
      "\u201cComedies and other topics are more likely to become mega-successes, but this (the dictatorship) is a very taboo subject for us,\u201d said Brazilian psychoanalyst and writer Vera Iaconelli, adding that she felt a \u201csense of urgency\u201d after watching the movie last month, even though the dictatorship ended almost four decades ago.",
      "As the movie was being shown across Brazil, the Federal Police unsealed a report detailing a 2022 plot by military officers to stage a coup to prevent President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva from taking office, and to keep far-right former army captain Jair Bolsonaro in power. Bolsonaro and his allies have denied any involvement in participating or inciting a coup.",
      "\u201cEven if (director) Walter Salles wanted to plan the timing of the release this precisely, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten it so right,\u201d said Lucas Pedretti, a historian and sociologist whose works address memory and reparations after the military dictatorship.",
      "\u201cThe film plays a very important role in telling us: \u2018Look, this is what would happen if the coup that was planned by Bolsonaro and his military officers had succeeded.\u2019\u201d",
      "Unlike countries like Argentina and Chile, which established truth commissions and prosecuted former dictators and their henchmen, Brazil's transition back to democracy was marked by a sweeping amnesty to military officials.",
      "For years, said Pedretti, Brazil\u2019s military promoted the notion that government silence was the best way to bury the past.",
      "It was not until 2011 that Brazil\u2019s then- President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses.",
      "The commission's 2014 report detailed harrowing accounts of torture and named perpetrators of human rights violations \u2014 none were ever imprisoned. But just as a reckoning of the dictatorship began, calls for a return to military rule emerged in street protests against corruption revelations.",
      "It was then that Marcelo Rubens Paiva, one of Rubens' sons, decided to share his family's story in his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here.\" The book introduced Eunice Paiva to a larger audience, chronicling her journey from a housewife to a relentless advocate for her disappeared husband, and how she raised five children by herself, while also pursuing a law degree.",
      "In the years that followed, far-right, anti-establishment forces increasingly gained traction. Bolsonaro \u2014 who has long celebrated the coup and praised dictatorship-era torturers \u2014 would go on to ride that wave to a presidential victory in 2018.",
      "Observing the surge of the far-right in Brazil, filmmaker Salles realized the country's memory of its dictatorship was very fragile. He said he saw a need for his country to confront its trauma in order to prevent history from repeating itself.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d isn\u2019t the first Brazilian movie to explore the memory of the dictatorship, but it is the most popular. Unlike other films on the subject that tend to focus on dissidents and armed resistance, Salles chose to frame his as a family drama and how the disappearance of the family patriarch upended their day-to-day lives.",
      "Its climax \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 arrives 25 years after Rubens\u2019 disappearance, when Eunice finally receives his death certificate.",
      "In December, a month after the film\u2019s premiere, the Brazilian government allowed families of dictatorship-era victims to obtain reissued death certificates acknowledging state-sponsored killings.",
      "\"It is very symbolic that this is happening amid the international repercussion of \u2018I\u2019m Still Here\u2019 ... so younger people can understand a bit of what that period was like,\u201d Brazil's Human Rights Minister Maca\u00e9 Evaristo said during the announcement, calling it an important step in the \u201chealing process for Brazilian society.\u201d",
      "The healing process remains incomplete, as some forces \u2014 once again \u2014 seek to prevent those who allegedly sought to sabotage democracy from being held to account.",
      "On Nov. 29, Bolsonaro urged Lula and the Supreme Court to grant amnesty for those involved in the 2022 alleged coup plot and, alongside his allies, pushed for legislation to pardon participants in the 2023 anti-democratic riot that aimed to oust Lula and marked an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe coup is still here. It\u2019s still in people\u2019s minds, it\u2019s still in the minds of the military,\u201d said Paulo Sergio Almeida, a filmmaker and founder of Filme B, a company that tracks Brazil's national cinema. \u201cWe thought this was a thing of the past, but it\u2019s not. The past is still present in Brazil.\u201d",
      "This time around, many Brazilians are calling for the prosecution of those responsible for the attempted coup, believing that justice is essential for national reconciliation and future progress.",
      "On Dec. 14, police arrested Bolsonaro's 2022 running mate and former defense minister in connection with investigations into the alleged coup plot, becoming the first four-star general arrested by civilians since the end of the dictatorship in 1985.",
      "\u201cIt's a sign that we are making progress as a constitutional democracy,\u201d leftist Sen. Randolfe Rodrigues wrote on X that day. \u201cBrazil still has a long way to go as a Republic, but today is a HISTORIC day on this journey.\u201d",
      "Brazilians have also embraced the \u201cNo amnesty!\" rallying cry, which originated at street protests in the aftermath of the capital's 2023 riot and can still be heard.",
      "Earlier this month, a Supreme Court justice cited \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d while arguing that the 1979 amnesty law shouldn\u2019t apply to the crime of concealing bodies.",
      "\u201cThe disappearance of Rubens Paiva, whose body was never found or buried, highlights the enduring pain of thousands of families,\u201d Justice Fl\u00e1vio Dino said.",
      "Striking a chord in Brazil was precisely Marcelo Rubens Paiva's intent when adapting his book into a film.",
      "\u201cThe movie is sparking this debate, and it arrived at the right moment for people to recognize that living under a dictatorship is no longer acceptable,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent evening in Sao Paulo, 46-year-old Juliana Patr\u00edcia and her 16-year-old daughter, Ana J\u00falia, left a movie theater in tears, touched by \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw all the suffering that Eunice endured, with Rubens being killed and taken from his family in such a brutal way,\u201d Patr\u00edcia said. \u201cIt made us even more certain that democracy needs to be respected and that, as Brazilians, we must fight harder to ensure that this never happens in our country again.\u201d",

      "A son of Hollywood, whose father Melville Shyer was one of the founding members of the Directors Guild of America, Shyer made an indelible mark on comedies, mostly of the romantic persuasion, in the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "Born in Los Angeles in 1941, Shyer cut his teeth writing for television, assisting Garry Marshall and working on shows like \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d before transitioning to films. He had writing credits on \u201cSmokey and the Bandit,\u201d Jack Nicholson\u2019s \u201cGoin\u2019 South\u201d and the Walter Matthau drama \u201cHouse Calls.\u201d A big breakthrough came with \u201cPrivate Benjamin,\u201d the Goldie Hawn comedy about a wealthy woman who inadvertently signs up for basic training, which he co-wrote with Meyers and Harvey Miller.",
      "It was a script that was initially turned down by every studio in Hollywood, even with Hawn attached to star and produce.",
      "\u201cWe went to a meeting at Paramount after they read the script, and Mike Eisner was the president of the studio, and we sat in his office with Mike and (producer) Don Simpson. And Mike said to Goldie, \u2018This is a mistake for you to make this movie,\u2019\u201d Shyer told Indiewire in 2022. \u201cGod bless Don Simpson who spoke up and said, \u2018Mike, you\u2019re 100% wrong on this one.\u2019\u201d",
      "The movie became one of the biggest hits of 1980. It got them an Oscar nomination and a win from the Writers Guild and also paved the way for his directorial debut \u201cIrreconcilable Differences.\u201d",
      "That film, which he also wrote with Meyers (they married in 1980), starred Shelley Long and Ryan O\u2019Neal as a writing-directing duo whose relationship crumbles after success and an infatuation with a young actor played by Sharon Stone. It was partially inspired by the tabloid affairs of Peter Bogdanovich, who left his wife and producer Polly Platt for Cybill Shepherd.",
      "\u201cNancy and I just laughed at the same things. We love the same movies, we kind of educate each other on the movies that each of us loved,\u201d Shyer told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cAnd Nancy really made me laugh. I think she wrote the best one-liners of anybody I know, except Neil Simon. And, and we were just always in sync \u2014 as filmmakers, we had this thing.\u201d",
      "They followed with \u201cBaby Boom,\u201d in which Diane Keaton plays a working woman who suddenly has to care for a baby, and \u201cFather of the Bride,\u201d which reimagined Vincente Minnelli\u2019s 1950 film for the 1990s with Keaton, Steve Martin and Martin Short leading the comedic ensemble. It was successful enough to spawn a sequel.",
      "Shyer and Meyers' last collaboration as a married couple before divorcing in 1999 was the remake of \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d with Lindsay Lohan, which Meyers directed and Shyer co-wrote and produced. Their daughters Annie and Hallie, whose names were used for Lohan\u2019s twin characters, both appeared in the film. Shyer is also survived by two children, Jacob and Sophia, from a subsequent marriage that ended in divorce.",
      "While Shyer often found himself doing remakes, he and Meyers never wanted to do \u201ccarbon copies\u201d of the originals and always endeavored to put their own stamp on their films. But even he was surprised by the longevity of some of them, remembering an old Billy Wilder quote that \u201ccomedy is not like fine wine, it does not age well.\u201d But, he said, they tried to avoid the temptation to include too many timely references.",
      "\u201cYou try to write things that are not basically of the moment, especially in comedy,\u201d he told Indiewire. \u201cTry to write stories about human beings that will reflect on today and tomorrow and yesterday.\u201d",
      "Shyer went on to remake \u201cAlfie,\u201d with Jude Law, and the Hilary Swank period drama \u201cThe Affair of the Necklace,\u201d neither of which did well at the box office. He also directed the Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte movie \u201cI Love Trouble,\u201d the only film of his that he admitted he didn't like.",
      "Other films never saw the light of day: He spent a year and a half prepping \u201cEloise in Paris\u201d but it was canceled when the production company suddenly went out of business.",
      "He stepped away from directing for many years but returned in recent years with two Netflix Christmas romantic comedies: \u201cThe Noel Diary\u201d and \u201cBest. Christmas. Ever!\u201d",
      "\u201cI just gravitated towards stuff I like,\u201d he told Indiewire. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a James Bond movie. I\u2019ve never seen one. I never liked science-fiction movies. \u2026 I like movies about people, and I want them to have substance.\u201d",
      "Shyer had told Indiewire that he was working on a script he'd been thinking about for decades, since he was hospitalized briefly at 17. He described the movie as a cross between \u201cThe 400 Blows\u201d and \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d And retirement, he said at the time, was not in the cards.",
      "\u201cWhat am I going to do? Garden?\u201d he said. \u201cI just have a lot of energy. I want to keep going. I actually love the process and I love the camaraderie. I love what I do. If I drop dead, maybe it will be holding a camera.\u201d"

      "Two family films are dominating the holiday box office.",
      "Two family films dominated the holiday box office this week, with \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d winning the three-day weekend over \u201cMufasa\u201d by a blue hair.",
      "Paramount's Sonic movie earned $38 million, while \u201cMufasa\u201d brought in $37.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a normal weekend counting Friday, Saturday and Sunday ticket purchases, the winner would be somewhat clear. But when the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney Co.'s \u201cMufasa\u201d had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million.",
      "It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the continued success of \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which are on their sixth and fifth weekends, respectively.",
      "The vampire horror \u201cNosferatu\u201d also debuted fairly triumphantly. Robert Eggers\u2019 modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet; the erotic drama \u201cBabygirl\u201d with Nicole Kidman; and \u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d about boxer Claressa Shields.",
      "\u201cNosferatu\u201d landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film, with $11.6 million (besting \u201cThe Faculty's\u201d $4.4 million in 1998). Focus Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters.",
      "The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It's been well received by both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore) and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race.",
      "\u201cBabygirl,\u201d an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on 2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the Venice Film Festival.",
      "\u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3 million, with $2 million coming from weekend showings where it played in 2006 theaters.",
      "Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas timeframe. Fourth place went to \u201cWicked,\u201d which earned another $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $424.2 million. On Tuesday, the lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home. It\u2019s a move that has drawn some critics who believe making it available at home after only 40 days in theaters will cannibalize profits.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d rounded out the top five films this weekend with $18.2 million. The Disney movie has made $882.5 million globally and is closing in on $400 million domestically.",

      "Authorities in Bucks County found Haddon, 76, dead in a second-floor bedroom Friday morning after emergency dispatchers were notified about a person unconscious at the Solebury Township home.

      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",

      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",

      "\u201cHolidays are really hard for people, so I don\u2019t mind working,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.\u201d",
      "Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cSome tend to overly emphasize the culture without the balance of discussing her work as an art form. The exhibition tries to complicate this and hopefully offers an opportunity of how her art moves across these different fields and disciplines,\" the curator said.",

      "Longtime CBS sportscaster Greg Gumbel has died from cancer",
      "Greg Gumbel, a longtime CBS sportscaster who broke barriers during his career calling some of the biggest sporting events, has died from cancer, according to a statement from his family released by the network on Friday. He was 78.",
      "\u201cHe leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten,\u201d wife Marcy Gumbel and daughter Michelle Gumbel said in a statement.",
      "In March, Gumbel missed his first NCAA Tournament since 1997 due to what he said at the time were family health issues.",
      "Gumbel was the studio host for CBS since returning to the network from NBC in 1998. Gumbel signed an extension with CBS last year that allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL announcing duties.",
      "In 2001, he announced Super Bowl 35 for CBS, becoming the first Black announcer in the U.S. to call play-by-play of a major sports championship.",
      "David Berson, president and CEO of CBS Sports, described Gumbel as someone who broke barriers and set standards for others during his years as a voice for fans in sports, including in the NFL and March Madness.",
      "\u201cA tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time,\" Berson said.",
      "Gumbel had two stints at CBS, leaving the network for NBC when it lost football in 1994 and returning when it regained the contract in 1998.",
      "Sean McManus said of all the moves he made in his nearly 27 1/2 years leading CBS Sports, one of his proudest was bringing Gumbel back.",
      "\u201cNot only did he elevate our NFL and NCAA coverage to a new level, but his kindness, generosity, sense of humor and unselfishness were second to none. When he was around, he made everyone from the researchers to the technicians to the executives feel like he was their best friend,\u201d said McManus, who retired as CBS Sports chairman in April. \u201cHis love for his family was always the foundation of his life. There will never be another Greg Gumbel, and our industry and this world is a sadder place without him.\u201d",
      "Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and called Major League Baseball games during its four-year run broadcasting the national pastime. In 1995, he hosted the world figure skating championships and the following year hosted NBC\u2019s daytime coverage of the Atlanta Summer Olympics.",
      "But it was football and basketball where he was best known and made his biggest impact. Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 NFL studio show, \u201cThe NFL Today,\u201d from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2004-05.",
      "Earlier this year, Gumbel recalled replacing Brent Musburger as host of \u201cThe NFL Today\u201d in 1990, describing it as intimidating and daunting.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I got to sit in the same chair and do the same thing or try to do the same thing that he did was an incredible honor,\" he said.",
      "Gumbel also called NFL games as the network\u2019s lead play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2003, including Super Bowl 35 and 38. He returned to the NFL booth in 2005, leaving that role after the 2022 season.",
      "\u201cLike all who knew and loved him, I too am saddened by his death, yet also so very grateful to have known him in my life,\u201d Clark Kellogg, a CBS Sports college basketball game and studio analyst, said in a statement. \u201cWhat a gift to be touched by such a good man and partner.\u201d",
      "Gumbel was the older brother of Bryant Gumbel, the host of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and \u201cReal Sports with Bryant Gumbel\u201d on HBO. Bryant Gumbel received a lifetime achievement award at the Sports Emmys in 2003.",
      "Greg Gumbel grew up in Chicago and graduated from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1967 with a degree in English. He had plans to become an English teacher, but after his brother got into sportscasting, he auditioned at WMAQ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Chicago in 1973, according to the book \"You Are Looking Live!: How The NFL Today Revolutionized Sports Broadcasting.\" He was soon offered a position as weekend sports anchor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised I got the job. I certainly wasn\u2019t anyone who was polished,\" he said in the book. \u201cBy my own reckoning, it took me a good year to start to feel comfortable in front of a camera.\u201d",
      "Gumbel also worked for ESPN and the Madison Square Garden network.",
      "James Brown, who currently hosts \u201cThe NFL Today,\" described Gumbel on Friday as \u201cMr. Versatility and also very telegenic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was my pleasure to call him a friend and one who could do anything that was given to him in the wake of an assignment,\u201d he added.",
      "Gumbel won local Emmy Awards during his long career and was the recipient of the 2007 Pat Summerall Award for excellence in sports broadcasting.",
      "Outside of his broadcast career, he was affiliated with the March of Dimes for three decades, including as a member of its board of trustees. He also was a member of the Sports Council for St Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital for 16 years.",

    "story": [
      "When Snoop Dogg agreed to become the sponsor of the Arizona Bowl, he had a demand: It must have a NIL component",
      "TUCSON, Ariz. -- Snoop Dogg has nearly as many ties to football as he does to rap music.",
      "The entertainer coached youth football for years and created the Snoop League, an after-school program for inner city Los Angeles youths. Snoop has been a guest analyst on football broadcasts and his son, Cordell Broadus, played Division I football.",
      "When Snoop took his latest step, becoming the sponsor of a bowl game, he had a demand: Find a way for all players in the game to receive name, image and likeness (NIL) money.",
      "\u201cThis was Snoop's idea,\u201d said Kym Adair, executive director of the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice. \u201cHe was having conversations with people he knows in the college football world and I got a call that said he wants us to be the first bowl to make this commitment and that's what we did.\u201d",
      "The beneficiaries are Colorado State and Miami (Ohio), who will conclude their seasons Saturday at Arizona Stadium in the Arizona Bowl. The bowl is classified as a 501(c)(3), so all revenue goes to charity. And, being one of the few bowls not tied to ESPN, it opens the door for unique sponsorship opportunities.",
      "The bowl was previously sponsored by Barstool Sports and the digital media company used its own cast of characters on the broadcast, which was streamed on its digital platforms.",
      "Snoop Dogg takes over this year. The rapper/entertainer is the latest celebrity to sponsor a bowl, following the footsteps of Jimmy Kimmel and Rob Gronkowski at the LA Bowl.",
      "And, Snoop being Snoop, he wanted to put his own spin on his own bowl.",
      "\u201cCollege football fans are exhausted by the constant talk around NIL, conference realignment, coach movement, transfer portal and super conferences,\u201d Snoop said in a video posted on social media. \u201cSo it\u2019s time that we get back to the roots of college football \u2014 when it was focused on the colleges, the players and the competition, the community, the fan experience and the pageantry.\u201d",
      "With that will be an NIL component.",
      "The bowl can't pay players just for playing in the bowl, but both teams participated in football clinics on Friday and will get paid for their services. Other bowls have given single players NIL opportunities, but this is believed to be the first to offer it to every player on both teams.",
      "\u201cI love the fact that the Arizona Bowl is unique and tries new things, and obviously having Snoop here is unique,\u201d Colorado State coach Jay Norvell said. \u201cThe NIL component, it\u2019s the future. It\u2019s what football has become now. We think it\u2019s fantastic for our kids and then the interaction with the kids is the hidden gem of the whole thing.\u201d",
      "The NIL component of the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl comes a month after a similar effort in The Players Era Festival basketball tournament in Las Vegas. The eight-team tournament said it paid out $9 million in NIL money to participating players for activities outside the competition. It also offered $50 million in NIL opportunities over the next three years for services and activities compliant with NCAA regulations.",
      "Are the Players Era Festival and Arizona Bowl the start of a new future? It is not out of the question in big-time college athletics, where schools are already preparing for the era of revenue sharing with players next year.",
      "\u201cRevenue sharing between the players and the athletic departments is already on the horizon, so whether that takes the place of these types of arrangements or they're completely separate has yet to be determined,\" Adair said. \"We're just trying to be flexible, ahead of the curve and make an impact any way we can.\u201d",
      "Just the way Snoop wants it.",

      "The former Morrison Hotel, made famous by The Doors and their 1970 album of the same name, was significantly damaged by a fire that erupted in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday.",
      "The four-story building, which has been vacant more than a decade, burned for nearly two hours before more than 100 firefighters brought the flames under control, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.",
      "The Morrison Hotel was featured on the cover of The Doors' fifth album. Celebrated music photographer Henry Diltz made the image in 1969 and said years later that it took a little trickery to pull it off.",
      "A hotel clerk told the band they weren't allowed to take photos inside, but when the clerk stepped away, the group ran into the lobby and Diltz quickly got the photo looking through the window, with legendary frontman Jim Morrison in the middle.",
      "\u201cIt was a great old wooden building with many small rooms upstairs where transients and drinkers could sleep it off on a cot for $2.50 a night!\" Diltz told The Associated Press on Friday. \"I think the beautiful front window with \u201cMorrison Hotel\u201d in red letters was the best part of it! So did The Doors!\u201d",
      "The album was viewed as a comeback to their roots for The Doors, coming on the heels of Morrison's on-stage arrest at a Miami concert that saw him convicted of indecent exposure and profanity.",
      "Morrison and The Doors would release one final album, \u201cL.A. Woman,\u201d before he was found dead in a Paris bathtub on July 3, 1971.",
      "Los Angeles firefighters who first arrived at the blaze on Thursday found heavy flames on the building's top floor.",

      "Viewers may gasp, cringe or cry out watching characters die on Netflix's \u201cSquid Game,\u201d but those simulated deaths have a different effect on its creator, writer and director. Instead, Hwang Dong-hyuk feels happiness seeing them go.",
      "The show has a huge cast and Hwang says it was \u201creally difficult\u201d to manage everyone on set.",
      "As characters would die, Hwang recalls saying to the actors on their last day, \u201c\u2018Oh no! How sad! I won\u2019t see you tomorrow,' but I was always smiling inside.\u201d",

      "Hwang originally conceived of the show 15 years ago as a two-hour film but it failed to gain traction with financiers or even interested actors. He put it aside and worked on other films instead. He then had the idea to make it a TV series instead and took the project to Netflix. There, it could reach a wide audience.",

      "HWANG: I learned that I shouldn\u2019t give up. If you love something and if you want to create something, it might not work now, but the time might come later. Or that idea could be the source of inspiration for something else.",
      "HWANG: I'm afraid to talk about it but it's a feature film taking place 10-20 years in the future. It's darker than \u201cSquid Game.\u201d It\u2019s going to be quite cruel, quite sad, but at the same time quite quirky and humorous.",
      "HWANG: I used to think you had to have a specific taste to be cool, but I actually think I\u2019m very omnivorous. I like to watch anything. When I\u2019m on the couch watching TV, sometimes I watch CNN or Fox News. And then National Geographic and nature documentaries, I also watch some very soapy Korean shows or reality TV as well. I hop around and watch everything that\u2019s kind of happening in the world. With a series, I often don\u2019t stick with it the whole way through. There\u2019s only about like five shows that I watched until the very end, like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cWhy Women Kill.\u201d",
      "HWANG: Of course. I studied film school at the University of Southern California and there are so many people I'd love to work with. I have had those offers since \u201cSquid Game,\u201d but because I'm a writer-director I think I'm best when I\u2019m working with Korean actors, giving direction in Korean with my Korean script. But, if I come across an amazing scrip, why not? I'd love to work with Jake Gyllenhaal.",
      "HWANG: With seasons two and three, I had more screen time for more characters. This time around we have a lot of younger characters. When I was creating season one, I thought it was very hard for you to be up to your neck in debt when you\u2019re only in your 20s or 30s. I thought you had to be at least middle-aged to need money and want to join the Squid Game. But the world has changed. Now I feel like there are less decent jobs for young people and they feel like working hard doesn't even get them to middle class. They want to hit the jackpot, so that's why they invest in cryptocurrency. In Korea, there are a lot of young people in their early 20s or 30s turning to online gambling. I wanted to show what society really is like today.",
      "HWANG: It's better than season two."

    "title": "It's called the 'Winter Arc.' And for some, it's replacing New Year's resolutions",
    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 13:30:35 -0500",
    "summary": "A new year brings new goals",
    "story": [
      "A new year brings new goals",
      "New York -- A new year is the time to set new goals. Yet studies have shown that most people don\u2019t tend to uphold their New Year\u2019s resolutions much past the first month.",
      "In an attempt to reframe the thinking around new year goal-setting, a new wellness trend has popped up online. It\u2019s called the \u2019Winter Arc.\u2019",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "The goal-setting challenge was created online by fitness and wellness influencers, so there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach or standard definition. There are over 400,000 posts on Instagram with the caption #winterarc, and almost 600,000 on TikTok.",
      "For many of those trying the trend, the Winter Arc involves utilizing the cold, dark earlier months of winter to turn inward and get a jump start on their goals, with the intent of having them in place by the time Jan. 1 rolls around.",
      "It\u2019s also meant to encourage participants to be extremely disciplined and rigid with their goals since it\u2019s a shorter period to get them done rather than an entire year, or indefinitely.",
      "Laura Galebe, an influencer and the self-proclaimed \u201cCEO of Glowup Series,\u201d posts videos to her social media accounts talking about her Winter Arc experience. She used the time to commit to \u201cwalking every day, journaling, and sticking to (her) skincare and wellness routines.\u201d",
      "\u201cI found it very transformative both mentally and physically,\u201d Galebe says. \u201cThe consistent movement helped me stay energized and the structure made the season feel a lot less heavy.\u201d",
      "Although some say the Winter Arc challenge can begin in October, it\u2019s never too late to start. According to Alex Rothstein, an exercise psychologist with the New York Institute of Technology, the best way to dive in is to carve out time each day to work on your goals.",
      "\u201cIf you make sure to actively plan and schedule each commitment,\" Rothstein says, \u201cyou will have an easier time adhering to the program.\u201d",
      "He also recommends setting reasonable, realistic goals that are achievable from day to day. \u201cRecognize that if unforeseen circumstances cause you to miss a day or miss a specific goal in a day, it does not mean you failed the entire process,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should be willing to pick up where you started the next day.\u201d",
      "Galebe recommends finding ways to make fitness \u201ccozy and convenient\u201d in the cold winter months.",
      "\u201cIf the thought of heading to the gym in freezing weather is demotivating, consider at-home workouts or joining a heated indoor Pilates or yoga studio,\u201d she says. \u201cAnother tip is to reframe movement as self-care. Winter is tough on your body and mind so I treat my walks or workouts as part of keeping my overall mental and physical health in check.\u201d",
      "To recap:",
      "\u2014Set realistic, attainable goals.",
      "\u2014Plan out your routine and find the time in your schedule in advance.",
      "\u2014Be okay with missing a day, giving yourself the space to pick up where you left off.",
      "\u2014Find cozy and convenient ways to stay active in the colder months.",
      "Elliot Berkman, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, says that goal progress, rather than simply goal attainment, is psychologically beneficial. He says it can provide \u201cpositive emotion, a sense of purpose and meaning as well as agency and autonomy.\u201d",
      "When it comes to goal-setting in a short, specific period of time, like the Winter Arc, he says those parameters can be helpful. \u201cPutting a time bound on a goal can improve the chances the goal is achieved. It\u2019s easier to maintain motivation if you know that you get to stop at some point as opposed to feeling like you need to keep up the hard work indefinitely, which can be demotivating.\u201d",
      "Some on social media have made comparisons between short-term fitness challenges and crash diets, with the idea being that once the challenge stops, one could return to unhealthy habits. But experts say that\u2019s not necessarily true.",
      "\u201cIf the challenge is used to help establish new and healthier habits for long term health and wellness, than the challenges are exceptionally useful to help guide and motivate to create these changes,\u201d Rothstein says. He recommends making a plan toward the end of the challenge to continue keeping up with your goals in an attainable and realistic way."

      "The latest government data shows that cases of a fast-spreading stomach bug are surging in parts of the United States",
      "Cases of a wretched stomach bug are surging in parts of the United States this winter, according to government data.",
      "The most recent numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show there were 91 outbreaks of norovirus reported during the week of Dec. 5, up from 69 outbreaks the last week of November.",
      "Numbers from the past few years show a maximum of 65 outbreaks reported during that first week of December.",
      "A norovirus infection is characterized by sudden vomiting and diarrhea. Outbreaks are often seen on cruise ships, in congregate living situations like nursing homes and jails, as well as schools and places where people are close together.",
      "Here are a few things to know about the virus.",
      "Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States, responsible for 58% of such infections acquired in the country each year, according to the CDC.",
      "Norovirus infections are caused by a group of viruses that spread easily, with as few as 10 viral particles having the ability to make someone sick, health experts say.",
      "There are about 2,500 norovirus outbreaks reported annually in the United States. The outbreaks can occur throughout the year but are most common from November to April.",
      "Along with with vomiting and diarrhea, common symptoms include nausea, stomach pain, body ache, headache and fever.",
      "Most norovirus outbreaks occur when people who are already infected spread the virus to others by direct means, such as through sharing food or eating utensils. Outbreaks can also be spread through food, water or contaminated surfaces .",
      "Illness caused by norovirus typically starts suddenly, with symptoms developing 12 to 48 hours following exposure to the virus. Most people get better within one to three days and recover fully.",
      "But with 19 to 21 million illnesses each year in the United States, norovirus nevertheless causes on average 900 deaths and 109,000 hospitalizations annually, mostly among adults aged 65 and older. It also leads to 465,000 emergency department visits, mostly involving young children.",
      "People of all ages can get infected and fall sick from norovirus. Young children, older people and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk, with dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea the top concern.",
      "There is no medication to treat norovirus. Rehydration is recommended by drinking water and other liquids, with the exception of coffee, tea and alcohol.",
      "Anyone suffering from dehydration should seek medical help. Symptoms of dehydration include a decrease in urination, dry mouth and throat, and feeling dizzy when standing. Dehydrated children may be unusually sleepy or fussy and cry with few or no tears.",
      "Rigorous and frequent handwashing is the best defense against norovirus during the peak winter season, scrubbing the hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds before meals.",
      "Scrubbing surfaces with household disinfectants can also help."

      "Even with abortion bans in place in most Republican-controlled states, the number of people obtaining them has grown slightly",
      "Abortion has become slightly more common despite bans or deep restrictions in most Republican-controlled states, and the legal and political fights over its future are not over yet.",
      "It's now been two and a half years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to implement bans.",
      "The policies and their impact have been in flux ever since the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.",
      "Here's a look at data on where things stand:",
      "Overturning Roe and enforcing abortion bans has changed how woman obtain abortions in the U.S.",
      "But one thing it hasn't done is put a dent in the number of abortions being obtained.",
      "There have been slightly more monthly abortions across the country recently than there were in the months leading up to the June 2022 ruling, even as the number in states with bans dropped to near zero.",
      "\u201cAbortion bans don\u2019t actually prevent abortions from happening,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health social scientist at the University of California San Francisco.",
      "But, she said, they do change care.",
      "For women in some states, there are major obstacles to getting abortions \u2014 and advocates say that low-income, minority and immigrant women are least likely to be able to get them when they want.",
      "For those living in states with bans, the ways to access abortion are through travel or abortion pills.",
      "As the bans swept in, abortion pills became a bigger part of the equation.",
      "They were involved in about half the abortions before Dobbs. More recently, it\u2019s been closer to two-thirds of them, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "The uptick of that kind of abortion, usually involving a combination of two drugs, was underway before the ruling.",
      "But now, it's become more common for pill prescriptions to be made by telehealth. By the summer of 2024, about 1 in 10 abortions was via pills prescribed via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "As a result, the pills are now at the center of battles over abortion access.",
      "This month, Texas sued a New York doctor for prescribing pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine. There's also an effort by Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back their federal approvals and treat them as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances,\u201d and a push for the federal government to start enforcing a 19th-century federal law to ban mailing them.",
      "Clinics have closed or halted abortions in states with bans.",
      "But a network of efforts to get women seeking abortions to places where they're legal has strengthened and travel for abortion is now common.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute found that more than twice as many Texas residents obtained abortion in 2023 in New Mexico as New Mexico residents did. And as many Texans received them in Kansas as Kansans.",
      "Abortion funds, which benefitted from \u201crage giving\u201d in 2022, have helped pay the costs for many abortion-seekers. But some funds have had to cap how much they can give.",
      "Since the downfall of Roe, the actions of lawmakers and courts have kept shifting where abortion is legal and under what conditions.",
      "Here's where it stands now:",
      "Florida, the nation\u2019s second most-populous state, began enforcing a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy on May 1.",
      "That immediately changed the state from one that was a refuge for other Southerners seeking abortion to an exporter of people looking for them.",
      "There were about 30% fewer abortions there in May compared with the average for the first three months of the year. And in June, there were 35% fewer.",
      "While the ban is not unique, the impact is especially large. The average driving time from Florida to a facility in North Carolina where abortion is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is more than nine hours, according to data maintained by Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor.",
      "The bans have meant clinics closed or stopped offering abortions in some states.",
      "But some states where abortion remains legal until viability \u2013 generally considered to be sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there\u2019s no fixed time for it \u2013 have seen clinics open and expand.",
      "Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states with new clinics.",
      "There were 799 publicly identifiable abortion providers in the U.S. in May 2022, the month before the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. And by this November, it was 792, according to a tally by Myers, who is collecting data on abortion providers.",
      "But Myers says some hospitals that always provided some abortions have begun advertising it. So they\u2019re now in the count of clinics \u2013 even though they might provide few of them.",
      "How hospitals handle pregnancy complications, especially those that threaten the lives of the women, has emerged as a major issue since Roe was overturned.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration says hospitals must offer abortions when they're needed to prevent organ loss, hemorrhage or deadly infections, even in states with bans. Texas is challenging the administration\u2019s policy and the U.S. Supreme Court this year declined to take it up after the Biden administration sued Idaho.",
      "More than 100 pregnant women seeking help in emergency rooms and were turned away or left unstable since 2022, The Associated Press found in an analysis of federal hospital investigative records.",
      "Among the complaints were a woman who miscarried in the lobby restroom of Texas emergency room after staff refused to see her and a woman who gave birth in a car after a North Carolina hospital couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died.",
      "\u201cIt is increasingly less safe to be pregnant and seeking emergency care in an emergency department,\u201d Dara Kass, an emergency medicine doctor and former U.S. Health and Human Services official told the AP earlier this year.",
      "Since Roe was overturned, there have been 18 reproductive rights-related statewide ballot questions.",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on 14 of them and lost on four.",
      "In the 2024 election, they amended the constitutions in five states to add the right to abortion. Such measures failed in three states: In Florida, where it required 60% support; in Nebraska, which had competing abortion ballot measures; and in South Dakota, where most national abortion rights groups did support the measure.",
      "AP VoteCast data found that more than three-fifths of voters in 2024 supported abortion being legal in all or most cases \u2013 a slight uptick from 2020. The support came even as voters supported Republicans to control the White House and both houses of Congress.",

      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",
      "Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.",
      "\u201cA majority of who I\u2019ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do because they haven\u2019t found anything or things are just really expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cParty packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.\u201d",
      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",

A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",

      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey forgot I had one leg,\u201d the 45-year-old said, laughing. The trainer at a center for amputee farmers picked himself up and added: \u201cWe fall and we rise.\u201d",
      "The phrase encapsulates his journey since the civil war in Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, conflict in the West African country created some 28,000 amputees like him. Amputation by machete was one terror tactic by rebels.",
      "But even now, amputation rates remain high in Sierra Leone due to motorbike accidents, poor medical care and delayed treatment by traditional healers, according to medical researchers. The government doesn't collect data on amputees, but the United Nations estimates there are about 500,000 disabled people in the country.",
      "Makieu's left leg was amputated as a child after rebels shot him and he received no medical attention for a week.",
      "More than 20 years later, in a nation ranked near the bottom of the U.N. development index, amputees still face discrimination, often regarded as a shameful reminder of the civil war. Many resort to begging and live in the streets.",
      "\u201cNo one cares about you as an amputee in Sierra Leone,\u201d Makieu said.",
      "The Farming on Crutches initiative where Makieu works near the capital, Freetown, offers a rare refuge. It aims to restore amputees\u2019 confidence and independence by teaching them skills to start a farm business. They\u2019ve trained 100 amputees and want to expand their work.",
      "The training has transformed Makieu's life. After his amputation in 2002, he lived in a small room with a friend in Freetown, dependent on him for food, money and shelter.",
      "At a displacement camp for 270 amputees in Freetown, he met Mambud Samai, the founder of Farming on Crutches and a pastor.",
      "\u201cMany (amputees) are being rejected by their families and communities. They don\u2019t believe they have love,\u201d the 51-year-old Samai said. He felt moved to help after being a refugee himself in Guinea during the civil war.",
      "First, Samai organized beach football matches for amputees in Freetown, boosting their confidence. During a visit to Sierra Leone, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon saw the project and funded a site for an amputee football club outside the capital.",
      "But Samai decided football was not enough. As a farmer, he saw agriculture as a path to self-sufficiency. In 2020, he set up a demonstration farm to teach amputees how to farm and become rural leaders.",
      "His project's name reflects amputees' widespread use of crutches instead of prosthetic legs in Sierra Leone. Foreign donors distributed them after the civil war but many people say they don\u2019t fit well and cause sores. And the country's only prosthetic clinic is too expensive for many.",
      "Makieu was one of the first Farming on Crutches trainees in 2022. He learned how to use farm waste for organic fertilizer and bamboo sticks for fences. He set up a small farm operation this year with his wife, Zanib, also an amputee. They met during the training and now have a child.",
      "Makieu wants to inspire future farmers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my dream to teach people about life. It\u2019s about changing your mindset,\u201d he said.",
      "Morning mist rolled over the nearby mountains as the camp rose for exercises ahead of a strenuous day. They gathered in a circle, harmonizing on local songs before Samai spoke.",
      "\u201cWe are created for fellowship, not isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we return, we are not as we came. We go home to serve our community as rural leaders.\u201d",
      "Makieu interjected: \u201cI sustain my life through farming, I met my wife here. This training can be a big package for you.\u201d",
      "But the vast majority of amputees in Sierra Leone have no such support.",
      "Alimany Kani, 30, lives in a camp built by the Norwegian Refugee Council for amputees on the outskirts of Freetown. He lost his leg when he was a baby, to the same bullet that killed his father in the civil war. Despite holding a master\u2019s degree in social work, he cannot find a job.",
      "\u201cEven if you have qualifications, an able-bodied with less education will always get the job,\u201d Kani said.",
      "Sierra Leone\u2019s National Commission for Persons with Disability told AP that discrimination towards amputees has improved in the last decade since the Disability Act in 2011 aimed to provide equal opportunities and punish discrimination.",
      "Kani firmly disagreed and called on the government to deliver reparations to victims of the civil war. Sierra Leone\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 recommended that amputees receive pensions, access to healthcare, accommodation and education.",
      "But many of those pledges remain unfulfilled, including for Kani. Only 1,300 out of 32,000 have received a full reparations package due to lack of resources, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration.",
      "\u201cThe government don\u2019t keep their promises. It\u2019s inhumane,\u201d Kani said.",
      "There currently is no specific support for amputees from the government, the National Commission for Persons with Disability said.",
      "Sierra Leone's health ministry, the president's office and the National Commission for Social Action office that manages the reparations program did not respond to questions.",
      "A farming charity in Britain, Pasture for Life, is financing Farming on Crutches in full, but Samai said they need support from Sierra Leone's government to expand.",
      "Meanwhile, the government is investing over $600 million in agriculture but some believe this will largely benefit large-scale agriculture over small-scale farmers, such as Farming on Crutches' trainees, who form 70% of the population.",
      "Two such smallholders are cousins and Farming on Crutches trainees, Amara and Moustapha Jalloh, aged 19 and 21, in central Sierra Leone.",
      "Both recently harvested rice and cassava. Moustapha, who was born without a leg, said his harvest surplus allowed him to pay for computer science training. He dreams of being an agricultural engineer.",

      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company based in Portland, Oregon, said Tuesday it had voluntarily recalled one batch of its two-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus.

      "No human cases of bird flu have been linked to the incident, but those who were in contact with the cat are being monitored for flu symptoms, Oregon authorities said.",
      "More than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC.

This settlement is not an admission of any wrongdoing; it instead allows us to avoid the further disruption, expense, and uncertainty of litigation in a matter that has lingered for over a decade.\"",
      "",
      "Under the settlement, Independent Health will make \"guaranteed payments\" of $34.5 million in installments from 2024 through 2028. Whether it pays the maximum amount in the settlement will depend on the health plan's financial performance.",
      "",
      "Michael Ronickher, an attorney for whistleblower Teresa Ross, called the settlement \"historic,\" saying it was the largest payment yet by a health plan based solely on a whistleblower's fraud allegations. It also was one of the first to accuse a data mining firm of helping a health plan overcharge.",
      "",
      "The settlement is the latest in a whirl of whistleblower actions alleging billing fraud by a Medicare Advantage insurer. Medicare Advantage plans are private health plans that cover more than 33 million members, making up over half of all people eligible for Medicare. They are expected to grow further under the incoming Trump administration.",
      "",

At 299 pounds, she never wanted to try the drugs because she knew surgery was faster and more permanent, and she wanted to lose the weight for her two young boys. Last week, 1 year after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, she had dropped 102 pounds. She no longer has type 2 diabetes, and her LDL, 140 before surgery, is now normal.",

      "",
      "Another trend that can improve the prospect of surgery's revival is that several insurance companies have reportedly dropped some of their more rigorous requirements for bariatric preparation, and some have dropped the need for prior authorization review.",
      "",
      "Additionally, some health plans are capping how much they'll pay for the GLP-1 drugs, if they cover them at all. The Mayo Clinic has capped that lifetime spending at $20,000, Elli said.",

      "",
      "\"I'm seeing patients sometimes with BMIs of 60, 70, 80, and no one has ever mentioned surgery to them before,\" she said. \"The only reason they come in is because they saw something about the medications. These are people who need such a significant amount of weight loss, they need surgery on top of the drugs.\"",

      "Some private practice surgeons contracted with Kaiser Permanente to perform bariatric surgery for the health plan's enrollees are also reporting a bump in patients in recent months.",
      "",
      "\"The GLPs have thrust a huge new cost on the Kaiser system that is probably unsustainable,\" said Billy, a Kaiser contractor. Lately, he said, \"we're seeing more Kaiser volume than we've ever seen before.\"",
      "",
      "Many clinicians interviewed said that just as cancer treatment often requires a combination of surgery and drugs, combination therapy will be the treatment plan for many patients with obesity. They may take the medications to lower weight to better prepare them for surgery, or after surgery after they reach a plateau.",
      "",
      "A possible offsetting factor is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposal last month that it would pay for the new weight loss drugs in 2026, if the new administration approves.",
      "",
      "Making Adjustments",
      "",
      "The Mayo Clinic has made adjustments to respond to the change in surgical volume, Elli said. \"We have shifted our practice so that we have more non-surgical practitioners to accommodate those patients who don't want surgery.\"",
      "",
      "Nationally, he expects many bariatric surgeons will adjust as well, diversifying their surgical repertoire. \"Surgeons who are only doing bariatric surgery need to reconfigure,\" he said. \"Current bariatric fellowship graduates may find it difficult to obtain a pure bariatric practice and may need to alternate with acute care surgery.\"",
      "",
      "For many bariatric surgeons, the prospect of taking on general surgery  --  where often it's one-and-done  --  goes against the reason they chose weight-loss surgery as a specialty. They wanted longer-term relationships with their patients.",
      "",
      "\"We operate on the patients and ideally follow them for as long as they're willing to come back, to make sure they're maintaining weight loss and healthy habits and help them along the way,\" Husain said. \"The theme in our world is that obesity is a chronic disease.\"",
      "",
      "The Payers Aren't Helping",
      "",
      "Benjamin Clapp, MD, a bariatric surgeon at Hospitals of Providence Memorial Campus in El Paso, Texas, chairs the ASMBS task force that tracks bariatric surgical volume every year.",
      "",
      "He said neither the official totals for 2023 nor estimates for 2024 are collected yet. However, data from centers accredited by the American College of Surgeons, which perform about 80% to 83% of all bariatric surgeries in this country, show that volumes were down by 5.5%, or more than 12,000 weight-reduction surgeries, in 2023.",
      "",
      "But 2024 is expected to be \"much, much worse because of the overwhelming impact that the GLP-1 drugs have had, which really took off this year,\" Clapp said.",
      "",
      "This year in El Paso he expects to perform 120 bariatric surgeries, compared with 180 in 2023. \"These are massive decreases in volume, at least for me,\" he said. \"I went from seeing 15 to 20 new bariatric patients weekly to one to three.\"",
      "",
      "The Center for Metabolic and Weight Loss Surgery at Columbia University said earlier this year that it expected a 10% to 20% decline in 2024 from 2023.",
      "",
      "That drop in bariatric demand is one of two big reasons why Clapp has made a career decision to leave the solo practice he has built up for the last 18 years.",
      "",
      "Sometime next year, he plans to either take an academic job and devote more time to studying how brain receptors function in rats with obesity, or become an employed hospital surgeon. On staff, he would do any variety of procedures and probably far fewer bariatric procedures on which he has built his practice.",
      "",
      "The other reason is declining reimbursement. Clapp said Medicare rates for common bariatric surgery CPT codes have dropped since 2019, despite rising inflation in practice costs. A check with Medicare's physician fee lookup tool shows he's right. For example, the national payment amount for a laparoscopic gastric bypass with small intestine reconstruction dropped from $1,937.82 to $1,842.13 between 2019 and 2024. Insurance companies generally follow Medicare.",
      "",
      "What's worse is that consultation pay has also been going down or has disappeared. \"Things are bundled more, so you get paid less overall,\" he said. \"It's like death by 1,000 cuts.\" Solo private practice \"has just become a model that's not sustainable, for myself or for my family.\"",
      "",
      "Clapp has filled in some of the blanks with other foregut surgeries, such as cholecystectomies and hernia repairs, but reimbursement rates have dropped for those, too, especially relative to his own practice costs.",
      "",
      "San Diego bariatric surgeon William Fuller, MD, said Scripps Mercy Hospital, one of the largest programs on the West Coast, will have performed around 800 bariatric surgeries in 2024, down from the prior year's 1,000. But he doesn't expect a year-over-year decline in perpetuity as some of his counterparts fear.",
      "",
      "\"Who knows when there will be a stabilization of this whole phenomenon?\" he asked rhetorically during an interview with a public relations representative present. \"But we see patients who tried some of these medications  --  when they had access to them  --  and they haven't had the same success. They had some rebound, regained weight, or just didn't have success to begin with.\"",
      "",
      "Bottom line: \"It's all about sustainability, which is always the case with medications,\" he said. \"How long can you remain on them, and for efficacy purposes and economic purposes, how are these medications going to be funded, with what kind of subsidies? There's still a lot of moving parts.\""

The World Health Organization warned that such an approach would overwhelm hospitals.",

He promoted the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment. The FDA in 2020 revoked emergency authorization of hydroxychloroquine for COVID, saying that it was unlikely to be effective against the virus and that the risk of dangerous side effects was too high.",

      "The outage hit at dawn, plunging the island into an eerie silence as electrical appliances and air conditioners shut down before those who could afford generators turned them on.",
      "\u201cIt had to be on the 31st of December!\u201d exclaimed one man, who only gave his name as Manuel, as he stood outside a grocery store in the capital of San Juan, grumbling about the outage that coincided with his birthday. \u201cThere is no happiness.\u201d",
      "Nearly 90% of 1.47 million clients across Puerto Rico were left in the dark, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees electricity transmission and distribution.",
      "Luma said in a statement that it appears the outage was caused by a failure of an underground power line, saying it is restoring power \u201cin the quickest and safest way possible.\u201d A Luma spokesman told The Associated Press that the incident was under investigation.",
      "The blackout fanned simmering anger against Luma and Genera PR, which oversees the generation of power in Puerto Rico, as a growing number of people call for their ouster.",
      "Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n, who is set to be sworn in on Jan. 2, has called for the creation of an \u201cenergy czar\u201d to review potential Luma contractual breaches while another operator is found.",
      "Meanwhile, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said he was in touch with Luma and Genera PR, adding on X that \u201cwe are demanding answers and solutions.\u201d",
      "Puerto Ricans began to plan ahead.",
      "\u201cI'll go to my balcony. That's where I'll sleep,\u201d Ra\u00fal Pacheco said with a shrug, as the 63-year-old diabetic sat on a walker nursing an injured foot.",
      "Julio C\u00f3rdova, a municipal worker, said he got dressed by the light of his cellphone and planned to buy candles.",
      "\u201cThis affects me because I had plans. It couldn't have been yesterday or tomorrow?\" he said, shaking his head as he raked leaves.",
      "While blackouts are rare in Puerto Rico, the island struggles with chronic power outages blamed on a crumbling power grid that was razed by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm in September 2017.",
      "The system, however, was already in decline after years of lack of maintenance and investment.",
      "Only recently did crews start making permanent repairs to Puerto Rico\u2019s power grid following Hurricane Maria. The island continues to depend on generators provided by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to help stabilize the grid.",
      "In November, Puerto Rico\u2019s government asked U.S. officials for permission to keep using more than a dozen portable generators for two additional years.",
      "Some Puerto Ricans took the latest outage in stride.",
      "\u201cThey're part of my everyday life,\u201d said Enid N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events.",
      "Meanwhile, Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority struggles to restructure more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of the island's government agencies.",

      "BERLIN -- Chancellor Olaf Scholz called on Germany's 84 million residents to stick together despite the many global crises and wars, the country's ailing economy and a deadly Christmas market attack that shocked the nation.",
      "\u201cStrength comes from solidarity. And we are a country that sticks together,\u201d Scholz said in his New Year\u2019s address, which will be broadcast Tuesday night. \u201cWe have it in our hands together: we can make 2025 a good year.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged that Germany is still reeling from the Christmas market attack that killed five and injured more than 200 people in the eastern city of Magdeburg when a Saudi doctor drove his car into a crowd. He was arrested on murder charges.",
      "\u201cWe are stunned by this inhuman act. How can an insane assassin cause so much suffering?\u201d Scholz said. \u201cAnd it is not only in Magdeburg that many are asking themselves: Where can we find the strength to carry on after such a catastrophe?\u201d",
      "He thanked all those who helped the injured and warned that attacks like the one in Magdeburg and other crises should not lead to division among Germans.",
      "\u201cWe are not a country of opposing each other, nor of passing each other by,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cWe are a country of togetherness. And we can draw strength from this \u2014 especially in difficult times like these. And these are difficult times, we all feel that.\u201d",
      "Ahead of a Feb. 23. general election, Scholz called on Germans to go vote and took a swipe at tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who twice this month called on people to choose the far-right Alternative for Germany party. \u201cYou, the citizens, decide what happens in Germany. It's not up to the owners of social media,\u201d Scholz said.",

    "story": [
      "A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing have examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing on Tuesday examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea while authorities were conducting safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country\u2019s airlines.",
      "All but two of the 181 people aboard the Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air died in Sunday's crash. Video showed the aircraft, without its landing gear deployed, crash-landed on its belly and overshoot a runaway at South Korea\u2019s southern Muan International Airport before it slammed into concrete fence and burst into a flame.",
      "The plane was seen having an engine trouble, and preliminary examinations also say the pilots received a bird strike warning from the ground control center and issued a distress signal as well. But many experts say the landing gear issue was likely the main cause of the crash.",
      "The South Korean government has launched safety inspections on all the 101 Boeing 737-800s in the country. The Transport Ministry said authorities are looking at maintenance and operation records during five days of safety checks that are to run until Friday.",
      "The ministry said that a delegation of eight U.S. investigators \u2014 one from the Federal Aviation Administration, three from National Transportation Safety Board and four from Boeing \u2014 made an on-site visit to the crash site on Tuesday. The results of their examination weren\u2019t immediately available.",
      "Kim E-bae, Jeju Air\u2019s president, told reporters Tuesday that his company will add more maintenance workers and reduce flight operations by 10-15% until March as part of efforts to enhance the safety of aircraft operations.",
      "John Hansman, an aviation expert at MIT, said the crash was most likely the result of a problem with the plane\u2019s hydraulic control systems. He said that would be consistent with the landing gear and wing flaps not being deployed \u201cand might indicate a control issue which would explain the rush to get on the ground.\u201d",
      "The Boeing 737-800 -- an earlier version of 737 than the Max -- is a widely used plane with a good safety record, according to Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has studied aviation safety.",
      "He said the failure of the plane\u2019s system for broadcasting location, operating its landing gear and extending the wing flaps to slow down indicate a widespread problem that affected electrical and hydraulic systems. He is confident that investigators will learn what went wrong by analyzing information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders.",
      "\u201cThese are really the two pillars for accident analysis and accident reconstruction,\u201d Meshkati said. Like other aviation experts, Meshkati also questioned the location of a solid wall just a few hundred feet (meters) past the end of the runway, given that planes occasionally do overshoot runways. \u201cHaving such a big concrete barrier over there was really very bad luck for this particular airplane,\u201d he said.",
      "South Korean officials have said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "The crash was the deadliest disaster in South Korea\u2019s aviation history in decades. A seven-day national mourning has been declared until Jan. 4.",
      "The Transport Ministry said Tuesday that authorities have identified 175 bodies and are conducting DNA tests to identify the remaining five. Bereaved families said that officials told them that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to relatives.",
      "On Tuesday, Park Han Shin, a representative of the families, accused the government of failing to provide freezers on time as promised and said there are worries that the bodies could decompose. \u201cThe last dignities of the victims are seriously hurt. We strongly criticize authorities for failing to keep its promise,\u201d Park said.",

      "Video of the crash indicated that the pilots did not deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and they did not manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they did not have time, said John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for a barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said.",
      "Other observers say the videos showed the plane suffering suspected engine trouble but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They say there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problems and the suspected engine problem.",
      "The Transport Ministry said Sunday the control tower issued a warning about birds to the Jeju Air plane shortly before it intended to land and gave the crew permission to land in a different area. It said the plane\u2019s pilot sent out a distress signal shortly before the crash.",
      "Investigators retrieved the jet\u2019s flight data and cockpit voice recorders, but it may take months to complete the probe into the crash, Joo, the Transport Ministry official, told reporters.",
      "The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board.",
      "Sunday's crash caused an outpouring of public sympathy for the dead, with the government issuing a seven-day national mourning period. Some questioned if the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, like the 2022 Halloween crush that killed 160 people and the 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people.",
      "The crash was yet more big news for South Koreans as they reel from a festering political crisis set off by Yoon's martial law decree, which brought hundreds of troops into Seoul streets and revived traumatic memories of past military rule in the 1970-80s.",
      "The political tumult resulted in the opposition-controlled National Assembly impeaching Yoon and Han. The safety minister stepped down and the police chief was arrested over their roles in the martial law enhancement.",
      "The absence of top officials responsible for managing disasters has also led to concerns.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply worried if the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters really can handle the disaster,\u201d the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial on Monday."

      "A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing have examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing on Tuesday examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea while authorities were conducting safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country\u2019s airlines.",
      "All but two of the 181 people aboard the Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air died in Sunday's crash. Video showed the aircraft, without its landing gear deployed, crash-landed on its belly and overshoot a runaway at South Korea\u2019s southern Muan International Airport before it slammed into concrete fence and burst into a flame.",
      "The plane was seen having an engine trouble, and preliminary examinations also say the pilots received a bird strike warning from the ground control center and issued a distress signal as well. But many experts say the landing gear issue was likely the main cause of the crash.",
      "The South Korean government has launched safety inspections on all the 101 Boeing 737-800s in the country. The Transport Ministry said authorities are looking at maintenance and operation records during five days of safety checks that are to run until Friday.",
      "The ministry said that a delegation of eight U.S. investigators \u2014 one from the Federal Aviation Administration, three from National Transportation Safety Board and four from Boeing \u2014 made an on-site visit to the crash site on Tuesday. The results of their examination weren\u2019t immediately available.",
      "Kim E-bae, Jeju Air\u2019s president, told reporters Tuesday that his company will add more maintenance workers and reduce flight operations by 10-15% until March as part of efforts to enhance the safety of aircraft operations.",
      "John Hansman, an aviation expert at MIT, said the crash was most likely the result of a problem with the plane\u2019s hydraulic control systems. He said that would be consistent with the landing gear and wing flaps not being deployed \u201cand might indicate a control issue which would explain the rush to get on the ground.\u201d",
      "The Boeing 737-800 -- an earlier version of 737 than the Max -- is a widely used plane with a good safety record, according to Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has studied aviation safety.",
      "He said the failure of the plane\u2019s system for broadcasting location, operating its landing gear and extending the wing flaps to slow down indicate a widespread problem that affected electrical and hydraulic systems. He is confident that investigators will learn what went wrong by analyzing information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders.",
      "\u201cThese are really the two pillars for accident analysis and accident reconstruction,\u201d Meshkati said. Like other aviation experts, Meshkati also questioned the location of a solid wall just a few hundred feet (meters) past the end of the runway, given that planes occasionally do overshoot runways. \u201cHaving such a big concrete barrier over there was really very bad luck for this particular airplane,\u201d he said.",
      "South Korean officials have said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "The crash was the deadliest disaster in South Korea\u2019s aviation history in decades. A seven-day national mourning has been declared until Jan. 4.",
      "The Transport Ministry said Tuesday that authorities have identified 175 bodies and are conducting DNA tests to identify the remaining five. Bereaved families said that officials told them that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to relatives.",
      "On Tuesday, Park Han Shin, a representative of the families, accused the government of failing to provide freezers on time as promised and said there are worries that the bodies could decompose. \u201cThe last dignities of the victims are seriously hurt. We strongly criticize authorities for failing to keep its promise,\u201d Park said.",

    "story": [
      "Moldovans are bracing for a difficult winter ahead as a looming energy shortage could leave them without enough energy",
      "CHISINAU, Moldova -- On a frigid morning in Moldova\u2019s capital, 39-year-old postal worker Petru Murzin braces for a difficult winter as he fears a looming energy shortage could leave many Moldovans with \u201cno heating, no light.\u201d",
      "His concerns aren\u2019t unfounded.",
      "On Jan. 1, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom is set to halt gas supplies to the European Union candidate country over an alleged $709 million debt for past supplies, a figure fiercely disputed by Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government, that has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy as a political tool to destabilize the country.",
      "\u201cI feel that we\u2019ve entered a crisis that is quite difficult to resolve \u2026 which worries me greatly,\u201d Murzin told The Associated Press in Chisinau. \u201cPrice increases are one thing, but when there is no gas at all, that\u2019s something entirely different.\u201d",
      "The cessation will stop gas flowing to the Kuciurgan power plant, the country\u2019s largest, which is situated in the separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region. The gas-operated plant generates electricity that powers a significant portion of Moldova proper.",
      "\u201cThere will be no heating, no light,\u201d Murzin added. \u201cWe are entering a very difficult year.\"",
      "Transnistria, which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries, also declared its own state of emergency earlier this month, fearing the region will not receive gas supplies. A large majority of Transnistria\u2019s 470,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens.",
      "On Dec. 13, Moldova\u2019s parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the looming crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, sparking fears it could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where the impact of the gas cutoff could be immediately felt.",
      "Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force residents in Transnistria to travel to Moldova to seek basic amenities to get through winter, a season in which temperatures throughout the country regularly drop below subzero degrees Celsius.",
      "Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, says that Moscow is likely trying to exploit a \u201cpotential humanitarian crisis in Transnistria to overwhelm Moldova\u2019s already-strained resources\u201d to amplify tensions between Chisinau and the region's de facto capital, Tiraspol.",
      "\u201cIt could stoke fears among the Moldovan electorate of a violent conflict, and give fodder to pro-Russian parties who will accuse Chisinau of being responsible for increased prices for gas and electricity, which will be a major campaign issue\u201d ahead of the country's parliamentary elections in 2025, he said.",
      "The unprecedented situation prompted Chisinau last week to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll probably have to save power till we have a solution,\u201d said Nicoleta Neagu, who is from Moldova but works in Germany. \u201cI hope we\u2019ll look at this seriously and not waste power on not-so-useful things.\u201d",
      "After Gazprom announced it would halt gas flows, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean accused Moscow of using energy \"as a political weapon\u201d and said his government does not recognize the debt cited by the Russian energy giant, which he said has been \u201cinvalidated by an international audit.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis decision confirms once again the intention of the Kremlin to leave the inhabitants of the Transnistrian region without light and heat in the middle of the winter,\u201d he said.",
      "For 30-year-old Chisinau resident Iuliana, who did not want to give her surname, power outages would prevent her from doing her online job, which could also be untenable if the heating goes off in the middle of winter in the country of about 2.5 million people.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re afraid, but we\u2019re happy that there\u2019s no snow and the temperatures aren\u2019t that low and we can turn on the heating maybe only in the evening if we work at an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I work from home and I\u2019ll be directly affected.\u201d",
      "She also noted that Moldova has faced multiple crises in recent years, \u201cBut regarding power and gas, it\u2019s the first time we face this,\u201d she said.",
      "Moldovan President Maia Sandu criticized Russia on Monday for Gazprom\u2019s decision and said that the country has gas supplies \u201cfor the heating season\u201d and measures will be taken \u201cto ensure uninterrupted electricity supply,\u201d adding that plans are also in place to provide humanitarian aid to residents in Transnistria.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin is again using energy blackmail in an attempt to destabilize the situation, to influence the 2025 parliamentary elections and to undermine our European journey,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important to remain united, show solidarity, and trust in Moldova and its people. And to use energy rationally.\u201d",
      "Olga Rosca, an adviser to Sandu, told the AP that most of Moldova, excluding Transnistria, \u201cshouldn\u2019t see major disruptions\u201d and that \u201ccheaper electricity previously supplied from Transnistria will be replaced by more expensive imports from the EU.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the Transnistrian region, however, the situation will be much more serious,\u201d she said, \u201cand any crisis there will inevitably affect all of Moldova.\"",
      "Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a vast \u201chybrid war\u201d by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country's EU aspirations.",
      "The Kuciurgan plant was privatized in 2004 by Transnistrian officials and later sold to a Russian state-owned company, but Chisinau doesn\u2019t recognize the privatization. On Monday, Recean asked the justice minister to review nationalization legislation to potentially recover \u201cstrategic assets that were forcefully taken over,\u201d referring to Moldovagaz, Moldova\u2019s main gas operator in which Gazprom owns a majority stake.",
      "Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, a fraction of that claimed by the Russian energy giant. Gazprom said in a statement Saturday that it reserved the right to take further action, including terminating its contract with Moldovagaz.",
      "In late 2022, months after Russia fully invaded neighboring Ukraine, Moldova suffered major power outages following Russian strikes on Ukraine, which is interconnected to the Kuciurgan plant.",
      "When the war next door started, Moldova was entirely dependent on Moscow for natural gas but has since pushed to diversify and expand its energy sources, and now relies on obtaining gas from other European markets.",
      "Murzin, the postal worker, is expecting to see large inflows of people from Transnistria crossing the border once the shortage hits.",
      "\u201cI think cars will line up for several kilometers at the border,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people will come here, hoping for warmth.\"",

      "People in Zimbabwe are shunning traditional grocery stores to do their shopping at informal and illegal markets that pop up at night to avoid police raids rampant during the day",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Batsirai Pabwe picked detergents, toothpaste, snacks and some pasta among several grocery items spread on the tarmac of a car parking space \u2014 an unorthodox night bazaar lit by cellphone flashlights and fluorescent lamps in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Traditional stores are struggling to survive as the volatility of Zimbabwe's new currency pushes prices up. Many like Pabwe now shun them for much cheaper informal markets that pop up at night to avoid the glare of authorities.",
      "From dusk, sidewalks, store or office verandahs and car parking spaces burst into unorthodox open air bazaars, offering anything from groceries to fresh meat, electronics, clothes, medicines, fashion accessories and stationery.",
      "Unfettered by expenses such as rising energy costs, taxes and laws that force formal retailers to accept the local currency at artificially low official exchange rates, informal traders, including children, offer better bargains. A box of juice that sells for $3 in a supermarket costs half of that on the street.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my first time shopping here. My friend told me that it\u2019s much cheaper than the supermarkets,\u201d 30-year-old Pabwe said, visibly relieved as he filled up a plastic bag with items for just $20. \u201cI decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.\u201d",
      "For the same amount in a supermarket a week ago, Pabwe said he only managed to get \u201cmeat and spices and they were not even that much.\u201d",
      "The once-prosperous southern African nation of 15 million people in April introduced a new gold-backed currency called ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, to replace one that had been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people.",
      "It is the country\u2019s sixth attempt at a new currency since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar and adoption of the U.S. dollar as legal tender amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the world\u2019s worst currency crashes to date. The U.S. dollar has since remained legal tender alongside successive local currencies.",
      "The latest currency, the world\u2019s newest, came with pomp and fanfare \u2014 promotional catchy jingles and songs played repeatedly on public radio, television and online.",
      "Seven months on, the ZiG seems to be tanking, like its predecessors. The gap between official and black market exchange rates continues to widen, with many people and informal traders who dominate the economy again preferring the more stable dollar.",
      "Traditional stores, forced by authorities to charge using the local currency, are increasing prices to make ends meet. But they have also become uncompetitive against unregulated informal markets, the Retailers Association of Zimbabwe, an industry representative group, said in September.",
      "It warned of store closures, saying the situation is \u201cclearly untenable.\u201d",
      "In October, Pick n Pay, one of Africa\u2019s biggest grocery chains that operates more than 70 stores jointly with a local partner in Zimbabwe, said that it had \u2018impaired\u201d its investment in Zimbabwe \u201cto a book value of zero\u201d because of the \u201cdeteriorating economic conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn every transaction business is doing in the formal setup, it\u2019s making an exchange rate loss that cannot be compensated. The major issue here is a currency crisis,\u201d said Gift Mugano, an economics professor. Huge overheads worsen the retailers\u2019 situation.",
      "\u201cEverything is against their survival. The informal sector works at night, (if there is) no electricity they use their phones, they don\u2019t care. They are there for survival,\u201d Mugano said.",
      "The contrast is palpable in Harare\u2019s Central Business District, where only a few shoppers solemnly scanned prices in a supermarket on a recent day.",
      "Soothing music played from speakers inside but was drowned out by the buzz created outside by hordes of street vendors shouting out bargains to a sea of shoppers.",
      "\u201cBusiness is booming,\u201d said Oswald Gari, a vendor, adding that he only works at night when the police leave.",
      "Gari, 51, said he's fending for his six children and four nephews under his care from the night trade. He harbors no hope of finding formal employment in a country where once roaring industrial sites are being turned into giant warehouses for imported goods, many which end up on the streets, and rail tracks are now overgrown with weeds.",
      "More than 80% of Zimbabwe\u2019s employable population ekes out a living in the informal sector, according to official figures and the International Labor Organization.",
      "For Pabwe, shopping from the informal night markets means less headaches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite confusing, especially for people like me who really don\u2019t understand the value of the ZiG. I always get confused when I get into supermarkets,\u201d he said.",
      "He was satisfied with his shopping at night bazaar.",
      "\u201cI got everything I was looking for and the pricing is really affordable. I actually managed to buy a handful for just $20. I even got my washing powder and dishwashing liquid,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I will do this more often.\u201d"

      "The Justice Department ordered the app's China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell TikTok or face a U.S. ban by Jan. 19, citing security concerns. The Supreme Court will take up the matter in January. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has asked the Supreme Court for a delay.",
      "If a ban does occur, small businesses will have to migrate to other platforms to find their customers. Instagram Reels, SnapChat and YouTube Shorts are alternatives. The good news is brands likely already have a presence there. But it may be harder to reach teens that have made TikTok their preferred social media app.",
      "Another alternative is to build a strong database of customers that opt in to providing contact emails or phone numbers. That lets owners reach out directly to customers with promotions and other marketing messages.",

      "Just over two years after the debut of ChatGPT, the world is getting a little savvier about what artificial intelligence technology can do for us and what it\u2019s not so great at",
      "If 2023 was a year of wonder about artificial intelligence, 2024 was the year to try to get that wonder to do something useful without breaking the bank.",
      "There was a \u201cshift from putting out models to actually building products,\u201d said Arvind Narayanan, a Princeton University computer science professor and co-author of the new book \u201cAI Snake Oil: What Artificial Intelligence Can Do, What It Can\u2019t, and How to Tell The Difference.\u201d",
      "The first 100 million or so people who experimented with ChatGPT upon its release two years ago actively sought out the chatbot, finding it amazingly helpful at some tasks or laughably mediocre at others.",
      "Now such generative AI technology is baked into an increasing number of technology services whether we're looking for it or not \u2014 for instance, through the AI-generated answers in Google search results or new AI techniques in photo editing tools.",
      "\u201cThe main thing that was wrong with generative AI last year is that companies were releasing these really powerful models without a concrete way for people to make use of them,\u201d said Narayanan. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing this year is gradually building out these products that can take advantage of those capabilities and do useful things for people.\"",
      "At the same time, since OpenAI released GPT-4 in March 2023 and competitors introduced similarly performing AI large language models, these models have stopped getting significantly \u201cbigger and qualitatively better,\" resetting overblown expectations that AI was racing every few months to some kind of better-than-human intelligence, Narayanan said. That's also meant that the public discourse has shifted from \u201cis AI going to kill us?\u201d to treating it like a normal technology, he said.",
      "On quarterly earnings calls this year, tech executives often heard questions from Wall Street analysts looking for assurances of future payoffs from huge spending on AI research and development. Building AI systems behind generative AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini requires investing in energy-hungry computing systems running on powerful and expensive AI chips. They require so much electricity that tech giants announced deals this year to tap into nuclear power to help run them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars of capital that has been poured into this technology,\u201d said Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan.",
      "Another analyst at the New York investment bank drew attention over the summer by arguing AI isn't solving the complex problems that would justify its costs. He also questioned whether AI models, even as they're being trained on much of the written and visual data produced over the course of human history, will ever be able to do what humans do so well. Rangan has a more optimistic view.",
      "\u201cWe had this fascination that this technology is just going to be absolutely revolutionary, which it has not been in the two years since the introduction of ChatGPT,\u201d Rangan said. \"It\u2019s more expensive than we thought and it\u2019s not as productive as we thought.\"",
      "Rangan, however, is still bullish about its potential and says that AI tools are already proving \u201cabsolutely incrementally more productive\u201d in sales, design and a number of other professions.",
      "Some workers wonder whether AI tools will be used to supplement their work or to replace them as the technology continues to grow. The tech company Borderless AI has been using an AI chatbot from Cohere to write up employment contracts for workers in Turkey or India without the help of outside lawyers or translators.",
      "Video game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists who went on strike in July said they feared AI could reduce or eliminate job opportunities because it could be used to replicate one performance into a number of other movements without their consent. Concerns about how movie studios will use AI helped fuel last year\u2019s film and television strikes by the union, which lasted four months. Game companies have also signed side agreements with the union that codify certain AI protections in order to keep working with actors during the strike.",
      "Musicians and authors have voiced similar concerns over AI scraping their voices and books. But generative AI still can't create unique work or \u201ccompletely new things,\u201d said Walid Saad, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and AI expert at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cWe can train it with more data so it has more information. But having more information doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re more creative,\u201d he said. \u201cAs humans, we understand the world around us, right? We understand the physics. You understand if you throw a ball on the ground, it\u2019s going to bounce. AI tools currently don\u2019t understand the world.\u201d",
      "AI can mimic what it learns from patterns, he said, but can\u2019t \u201cunderstand the world so that they reason on what happens in the future.\u201d That, he said, is where AI falls short.",
      "\u201cIt still cannot imagine things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that imagination is what we hope to achieve later.\u201d",
      "Saad pointed to a meme about AI as an example of that shortcoming. When someone prompted an AI engine to create an image of salmon swimming in a river, he said, the AI created a photo of a river with cut pieces of salmon found in grocery stores.",
      "\u201cWhat AI lacks today is the common sense that humans have, and I think that is the next step,\u201d he said.",
      "That type of reasoning is a key part of the process of making AI tools more useful to consumers, said Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president of Cisco's innovation and incubation arm, Outshift. AI developers are increasingly pitching the next wave of generative AI chatbots as AI \u201cagents\u201d that can do more useful things on people\u2019s behalf.",
      "That could mean being able to ask an AI agent an ambiguous question and have the model able to reason and plan out steps to solving an ambitious problem, Pandey said. A lot of technology, he said, is going to move in that direction in 2025.",
      "Pandey predicts that eventually, AI agents will be able to come together and perform a job the way multiple people come together and solve a problem as a team rather than simply accomplishing tasks as individual AI tools. The AI agents of the future will work as an ensemble, he said.",
      "Future Bitcoin software, for example, will likely rely on the use of AI software agents, Pandey said. Those agents will each have a specialty, he said, with \u201cagents that check for correctness, agents that check for security, agents that check for scale.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting to an agentic future,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have all these agents being very good at certain skills, but also have a little bit of a character or color to them, because that\u2019s how we operate.\u201d",
      "AI tools have also streamlined, or lent in some cases a literal helping hand, to the medical field. This year's Nobel Prize in chemistry \u2014 one of two Nobels awarded to AI-related science \u2014 went to work led by Google that could help discover new medicines.",
      "Saad, the Virginia Tech professor, said that AI has helped bring faster diagnostics by quickly giving doctors a starting point to launch from when determining a patient's care. AI can't detect disease, he said, but it can quickly digest data and point out potential problem areas for a real doctor to investigate. As with other arenas, however, it poses a risk of perpetuating falsehoods.",
      "Tech giant OpenAI has touted its AI-powered transcription tool Whisper as having near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy,\u201d for example. But experts have said that Whisper has a major flaw: It is prone to making up chunks of text or even entire sentences.",
      "Pandey, of Cisco, said that some of the company's customers who work in pharmaceuticals have noted that AI has helped bridge the divide between \u201cwet labs,\u201d in which humans conduct physical experiments and research, and \u201cdry labs\u201d where people analyze data and often use computers for modeling.",
      "When it comes to pharmaceutical development, that collaborative process can take several years, he said \u2014 with AI, the process can be cut to a few days.",
      "\"That, to me, has been the most dramatic use,\" Pandey said."

      "South Korean officials plan to conduct safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country\u2019s airlines, as they struggle to determine what caused a weekend plane crash that killed 179 people",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean officials said Monday they will conduct safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines, as they struggle to determine what caused a plane crash that killed 179 people a day earlier.",
      "Sunday's crash, the country\u2019s worst aviation disaster in decades, triggered an outpouring of national sympathy. Many people worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the disaster as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country\u2019s top two officials, amid political tumult caused by Yoon\u2019s brief imposition of martial law earlier this month.",
      "New acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash and instructed authorities to conduct an emergency review of the country\u2019s aircraft operation systems.",
      "\u201cThe essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,\u201d said Choi, who is also deputy prime minister and finance minister.",
      "The Boeing 737-800 plane operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air aborted its first landing attempt for reasons that aren\u2019t immediately clear. Then, during its second landing attempt, it received a bird strike warning from the ground control center before its pilot issued a distress signal. The plane landed without its front landing gear deployed, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball.",
      "Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines and now a consultant, said the Boeing 737-800 is a \u201cproven airplane\u201d that belongs to a different class of aircraft than the Boeing 737 Max jetliner that was linked to fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.",
      "But South Korea's Transport Ministry said Monday it plans to conduct safety inspections of all of the 101 Boeing 737-800 jetliners operated by the country\u2019s airlines as well as a broader review into safety standards at Jeju Air, which operates 39 of those planes. Senior ministry official Joo Jong-wan said representatives from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing were expected to arrive in South Korea on Monday to participate in the investigation.",
      "Ministry officials also said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "Joo said the ministry has determined that similar concrete structures are in other domestic airports, including in Jeju Island and the southern cities of Yeosu and Pohang, as well as airports in the United States, Spain and South Africa.",
      "Video of the crash indicated that the pilots did not deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and did not manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they did not have time, said John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for the barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said.",
      "Other observers said the videos showed the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They said there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problem and the suspected engine issue.",
      "Earlier Monday, another Boeing 737-800 plane operated by Jeju Air returned to Seoul\u2019s Gimpo International Airport shortly after takeoff when the pilot detected a landing gear issue. Song Kyung-hoon, a Jeju Air executive, said the issue was resolved through communication with a land-based equipment center, but the pilot decided to return to Gimpo as a precautionary measure.",
      "Joo said officials were reviewing whether there might have been communication problems between air traffic controllers and the pilot. \u201cOur current understanding is that, at some point during the go-around process, communication became somewhat ineffective or was interrupted, ahead of the landing and impact,\u201d he said.",
      "Ministry officials said Monday the plane\u2019s flight data and cockpit audio recorders were moved to a research center at Gimpo airport ahead of their analysis. Ministry officials earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash.",
      "The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board.",
      "The crash left many South Koreans shocked and ashamed, with the government announcing a seven-day national mourning period through Jan. 4. Some questioned whether the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, such as a 2022 Halloween crush in Seoul that killed 160 people and a 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people.",
      "The Transport Ministry said authorities have identified 146 bodies and are collecting DNA and fingerprint samples from the other 33.",
      "Park Han Shin, a representative of the bereaved families, said they were told that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to their families.",
      "\u201cI demand that the government mobilize more personnel to return our brothers and family members as intact as possible more swiftly,\u201d he said, choking down tears.",
      "The crash was yet more major news for South Koreans already reeling from a political crisis set off by Yoon\u2019s martial law decree, which brought hundreds of troops into Seoul streets and revived traumatic memories of past military rule in the 1970-80s.",
      "The political tumult resulted in the opposition-controlled National Assembly impeaching Yoon and Han. The safety minister stepped down and the police chief was arrested over their roles in the martial law inforcement.",
      "The absence of top officials responsible for managing disasters has led to concerns.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply worried whether the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters really can handle the disaster,\u201d the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial Monday."

      "WASHINGTON -- A machinists strike. Another safety problem involving its troubled top-selling airliner. A plunging stock price.",
      "2024 was already a dispiriting year for Boeing, the American aviation giant. But when one of the company's jets crash-landed in South Korea on Sunday, killing all but two of the 181 people on board, it brought to a close an especially unfortunate year for Boeing.",
      "The cause of the crash remains under investigation, and aviation experts were quick to distinguish Sunday's incident from the company\u2019s earlier safety problems.",
      "Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines who is now a consultant, said it would be inappropriate to link the incident Sunday to two fatal crashes involving Boeing\u2019s troubled 737 Max jetliner in 2018 and 2019. In January this year, a door plug blew off a 737 Max while it was in flight, raising more questions about the plane.",
      "The Boeing 737-800 that crash-landed in Korea, Price noted, is \u201ca very proven airplane. \"It\u2019s different from the Max ...It\u2019s a very safe airplane.\u2019\u2019",
      "For decades, Boeing has maintained a role as one of the giants of American manufacturing. But the the past year's repeated troubles have been damaging. The company's stock price is down more than 30% in 2024.",
      "The company's reputation for safety was especially tarnished by the 737 Max crashes, which occurred off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019 and left a combined 346 people dead. In the five years since then, Boeing has lost more than $23 billion. And it has fallen behind its European rival, Airbus, in selling and delivering new planes.",
      "Last fall, 33,000 Boeing machinists went on strike, crippling the production of the 737 Max, the company's bestseller, the 777 airliner and 767 cargo plane. The walkout lasted seven weeks, until members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreed to an offer that included 38% pay raises over four years.",
      "In January, a door plug blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. Federal regulators responded by imposing limits on Boeing aircraft production that they said would remain in place until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company.",
      "In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration regulators who approved the 737 Max. Acting on Boeing\u2019s incomplete disclosures, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training instead of more intensive training in flight simulators. Simulator training would have increased the cost for airlines to operate the Max and might have pushed some to buy planes from Airbus instead. (Prosecutors said they lacked evidence to argue that Boeing\u2019s deception had played a role in the crashes.)",
      "But the plea deal was rejected this month by a federal judge in Texas, Reed O\u2019Connor, who decided that diversity, inclusion and equity or DEI policies in the government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in choosing an official to oversee Boeing\u2019s compliance with the agreement.",
      "Boeing has sought to change its culture. Under intense pressure over safety issues, David Calhoun departed as CEO in August. Since January, 70,000 Boeing employees have participated in meetings to discuss ways to improve safety."

      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",

As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend.

After three months without anyone winning the top prize in the lottery, a ticket worth an estimated $1.22 billion was sold in California for the drawing Friday night, according to the Mega Millions website.",
      "The California Lottery said the winning ticket was sold at Circle K (Sunshine Food and Gas) on Rhonda Road in Cottonwood, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of Sacramento.

      "TORONTO -- Two Canadian Cabinet ministers left a meeting at Mar-a-Lago on Friday without assurances President-elect Donald Trump will back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner.",
      "The Canadians called the talks \u201cproductive\u201d and said there would be further discussions but one official said the Americans remain fixated on the U.S. trade deficit with Canada.",
      "Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly met with Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, as well as North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Interior Department.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products if Canada does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and fentanyl into the United States \u2014 even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened.",
      "\u201cMinister LeBlanc and Minister Joly had a positive, productive meeting at Mar-a-Lago with Howard Lutnick and Doug Burgum, as a follow-up to the dinner between the Prime Minister and President Trump last month,\u201d said Jean-S\u00e9bastien Comeau, a spokesman for LeBlanc.",

      "Comeau said Lutnick and Burgum agreed to relay the information to Trump.",
      "A senior Canadian official, however, said the Americans remain preoccupied on the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and want it to shrink. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.",

      "Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. \u2014 where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually \u2014 is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia.",
      "On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue.",
      "The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act\u2019s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,\u201d said Trump\u2019s amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice for solicitor general.",
      "The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table.",
      "He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral.",
      "He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it.",
      "The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards.",
      "Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and \u201cseeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\u201d",
      "In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on \u201calleged \u2018risks\u2019 that China could exercise control\u201d over TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates.",
      "The Biden administration has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok\u2019s legal filing said, adding that the U.S. fears are predicated on future risks.",
      "In its filing Friday, the Biden administration said because TikTok \u201cis integrated with ByteDance and relies on its propriety engine developed and maintained in China,\u201d its corporate structure carries with it risk."

      "WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her agency will need to start taking \u201cextraordinary measures,\u201d or special accounting maneuvers intended to prevent the nation from hitting the debt ceiling, as early as January 14, in a letter sent to congressional leaders Friday afternoon.",
      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling \u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out the government risks defaulting on its debt unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government\u2019s ability to borrow.",
      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Joe Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation\u2019s debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \u201cAnything else is a betrayal of our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "Notably however, Yellen said, on Jan. 2 the debt is projected to temporarily decrease due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments. As a result, \u201cTreasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.",
      "The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion \u2014 which ballooned across both Republican and Democratic administrations. And the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic pushed up government borrowing costs such that debt service next year will exceed spending on national security.",
      "Republicans, who will have full control of the White House, House and Senate in the new year, have big plans to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and other priorities but debate over how to pay for them."

      "Many parents open 529s for their children when they are born; they have no way of knowing whether their kids will earn a scholarship or even go to college at all. Fortunately, parents of multiple children can change the beneficiary of a 529 plan.",

      "Thanks to\u202f Secure 2.0, college savers won\u2019t have to worry about overfunding their 529s. Starting this year, you can now\u202f roll over unused 529 funds to a Roth IRA. But don\u2019t think the 529 rollover is a loophole to save extra for retirement; there are rules that limit the conversions.",
      "Here\u2019s what you should consider when converting your 529 funds to a Roth IRA.",
      "The Roth IRA receiving the funds must be in the name of the 529 plan beneficiary.",
      "The 529 plan must be open for at least 15 years.",
      "You cannot convert 529 contributions made within the past five years (or the earnings on those contributions).",
      "The 529 funds you roll over count toward your IRA annual contribution limit.",
      "You can move a maximum of $35,000 from a 529 plan to a Roth IRA during your lifetime.",
      "529 funds must be converted by paying the amount directly to a Roth IRA\u2014you can\u2019t pay yourself and then deposit the money into the Roth IRA later.",

      "Roth IRA income limits do not apply to 529 rollovers.",
      "While avoiding the\u202f Roth IRA \u202fincome limits is a retirement-saving perk for those with higher income, the rest of the rules around rolling over your excess 529 funds are designed to ensure that people are using 529 plans for their intended purpose: education. The annual contribution limits as well as the lifetime cap on conversions mean that you can\u2019tdouble up on your retirement funding.",
      "So, what\u2019s the bottom line?",
      "The ability to convert unused 529 funds to a Roth IRA can help alleviate potential concerns about oversaving for education. Still, don\u2019t count on your 529 as a means to save for retirement. Instead, consider funding your Roth IRA separately.",

      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \u201cWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect, was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump's movement but his stance on the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers.",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "\u201cThere is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,\" he said in a post. \u201cIt is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.\u201d",
      "Trump's own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement.",
      "His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "Trump's businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club, and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers.",
      "During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\" and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges.",
      "\u201cI think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" he told the \u201cAll-In\" podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world.",
      "Those comments came on the cusp of Trump's budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes."

      "\u201cWe know that voluntary cyber security practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,\u201d she said.",

    "summary": "2024 was another banner year for a source of electricity that is better for people&rsquo;s lungs, better for climate change and may be reaching your home now when you turn on the lights or turn up the thermostat &mdash; large banks of batteries",
    "story": [
      "2024 was another banner year for a source of electricity that is better for people\u2019s lungs, better for climate change and may be reaching your home now when you turn on the lights or turn up the thermostat \u2014 large banks of batteries",
      "2024 was another banner year for a source of electricity that is better for people's lungs, better for climate change and may be reaching your home when you turn on the lights or turn up the thermostat \u2014 large banks of batteries.",
      "This ability to store large amounts of electricity in batteries was essentially nonexistent a decade ago, but the country had about 24 gigawatt-hours operating as of the end of November, up a whopping 71% over the same date in 2023.",
      "This is welcome news to clean energy advocates including Dariella Rodriguez. She has seen what happens on days when demand for air conditioning or heating spikes and extra power plants fueled by natural gas, located in Port Morris and Mott Haven, fire up not far from where she works in Hunts Point in the South Bronx, New York.",
      "Batteries can jolt into service, sending electricity onto overhead wires, instead of these dirty \u201cpeaker\u201d plants. Rodriguez hasn't seen that transition yet, but she hopes to.",
      "\u201cThe people that are exposed to these plants are the most vulnerable people in environmental justice communities already,\u201d said Rodriguez, a director at THE POINT Community Development Corporation there, noting that lower-income people and communities of color often live near peakers.",
      "The nation\u2019s 1,000 peaker plants can be very dirty, inefficient and expensive, according to an analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a watchdog group that works for the U.S. Congress. Some 63 million people are estimated to live within a three-mile radius of one.",
      "Although peakers run only a small part of the time, they release more harmful nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide per unit of energy, the agency said. Those two pollutants cause asthma and other breathing problems.",
      "Peakers also release more greenhouse gases than other power plants do per unit of electricity.",
      "Batteries are \u201ca really obvious solution\u201d to reducing need for peakers, says Daniel Chu, senior energy planner for the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance.",
      "Storing extra power in batteries also extends the hours of the day that you can use clean energy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not always sunny, the wind\u2019s not always blowing, but energy storage can help move that generation to when it\u2019s most needed,\u201d said Tim Fox, managing director at research firm ClearView Energy Partners.",
      "That's why at least half of battery storage facilities in the U.S. are co-located with, or in some other way support solar, an AP analysis of Energy Information Administration data shows. The amount of solar energy in the U.S. is growing and surpassed the 100-gigawatt mark this year.",
      "Another way that the addition of these batteries is helpful to the American electrical grid and grids around the world is that forecasting is getting more difficult.",
      "\u201cWith weather patterns changing, the old ways of essentially figuring out how much capacity you need on the grid for extreme events just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Oliver Garnett, director of energy services product at the technology company Fermata Energy.",
      "Last, global electricity demand is slated to increase \u2014 by about one-third to three-quarters by 2050, according to the Energy Information Administration. Data centers for artificial intelligence, switching vehicles to electricity and population growth are all contributing.",
      "\u201c\u2018Do we have enough power plants?\u2019 is the classic question every utility asks every year,\u201d said Mike Jacobs, senior energy analyst at the science nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThe beauty of the batteries is that if there\u2019s energy in them, they can be used for unexpected needs.\u201d",
      "Otherwise, if utilities have to find more power generation, they may keep investing in plants that burn gas or coal and account for one-quarter of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, instead of retiring them.",
      "Leading the charge for adding new batteries to the grid this year was California with more than 11 gigawatt-hours operating. One way to think about this is roughly the amount of electricity that a nuclear power plant would put out over 11 hours. Then the batteries would need to be recharged to do the same thing again. It's a limited, but meaningful amount of power. In Texas, 6 gigawatt-hours were online. Arizona saw nearly 2 gigawatt-hours humming and Nevada \u2014 the fourth-largest deployer of storage in the U.S. \u2014 had 1.1 gigawatt-hours operational.",
      "Yet many states aren't using storage yet. As of November, 86% of large-scale battery storage in the U.S. was operating in just those four states.",
      "Some states haven't set targets telling utilities to go out and build or buy energy storage on their own. Only 18 states have 50 megawatt-hours or more operating.",
      "Others don't have as much clean electricity to pair with the batteries, or claim storage isn\u2019t reliable in times of crisis. It can also be challenging to connect storage to the grid. Still, experts expect more momentum.",
      "Especially in California and Texas, \u201cThat investment and that experiment is paying off very well,\u201d said John Hensley, senior vice president of markets and policy analysis at American Clean Power.",
      "\u201cThe word is getting out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re increasingly seeing the technology move to other parts of the country.\u201d",

      "In fact, the standout defensive tackle was bullish about success coming much quicker.",
      "\u201cYou see it around the NFL,\u201d Payne said on Jan. 7. \"Just last year, the Houston Texans, man, they was horrible. Now, look at them. They\u2019re a playoff team. All it takes is a couple pieces. A couple pieces, a couple good players and just start a run.\u201d",
      "Steps away from his locker stall, 357 days later, new coach Dan Quinn called over new general manager Adam Peters to celebrate the Commanders completing an improbable turnaround. Peters held a game ball from Washington's 30-24 overtime victory in his hand and addressed controlling owner Josh Harris.",
      "\u201cThere's no better gift that you can give a man on his 60th birthday than a playoff berth,\u201d Peters said, handing the ball to Harris while players cheered.",
      "\u201cThank you guys for everything,\u201d Harris exclaimed. \u201cPlayoffs!\"",
      "Jan. 11, 12 or 13 at Tampa Bay, Philadelphia or the Los Angeles Rams will be just Washington's seventh playoff game this century, and it comes in Jayden Daniels' breakout rookie season after taking the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback with the No. 2 pick.",
      "\u201cThe fan base waited a long time for this,\u201d Daniels said after leading another comeback victory. \u201cI really can\u2019t put into words how much it means to them and how much it means to me to be able to go out there and lead this franchise and this team to opportunities like that.\u201d",
      "Payne maybe had a premonition. Super Bowl champion tight end Zach Ertz agreed to join the Commanders in early March long before Daniels was drafted and even before veteran QB Marcus Mariota signed as a free agent.",
      "After Harris and ownership put Peters in charge of football operations, then they collaborated to hire Quinn, Kliff Kingsbury was brought in to run the offense and Joe Whitt Jr. the defense.",
      "\u201cI knew with the staff that they were building that we were going to have a chance,\u201d Ertz said.",
      "Following Ertz to Washington were six-time All-Pro Bobby Wagner and fellow linebackers Frankie Luvu and Dante Fowler, safety Jeremy Chinn, running back Austin Ekeler, defensive end Dorance Armstrong and offensive linemen Nick Allegretti, Tyler Biadasz.",
      "\u201cWe started bringing in veterans who I played against my whole life that a lot of them have torched us our whole life: Zach Ertz, Bobby Wagner \u2014 all these guys,\u201d punter Tress Way said.",
      "With Peters turning over more than half the 90-man training camp roster, gelling was important.",
      "\u201cEverybody had to get to know each other,\u201d said Wagner, who won the Super Bowl with Seattle when Quinn was defensive coordinator there. \u201cEverybody had to kind of build that camaraderie. And I think we did that really fast. There was a lot of guys that bought into the culture, bought into the people around them, had confidence in the people around them.\u201d",
      "Spring workouts allowed for that and helped the light bulb go off for Way, the team's longest-tenured player who endured a lot of losing over his decade in the league. He gave up his number to Daniels so the new face of the franchise could wear the same No. 5 on his chest that he did at Arizona State and LSU.",
      "There were no regrets.",
      "\u201cThe first time I saw \u20185\u2019 throw the football, I just thought, \u2018Well, let\u2019s play some ball and see what happens,'\u201d Way said.",
      "Daniels was not anointed the starter when he arrived, nor at the beginning of training camp. It took a couple of preseason games before Quinn made that declaration.",
      "\u201cNothing\u2019s ever been given to anyone on this team,\u201d Ertz said. \u201cEven Jayden, they made him earn it throughout training camp, throughout the offseason. And that stuff doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by players like myself who have been in the league for 12 years.\u201d",
      "Daniels lost his NFL debut, then led the Commanders on a four-game winning streak and victories in seven of the next eight while gutting through a rib injury, including a Hail Mary touchdown throw to beat Chicago among his many spectacular moments.",
      "\u201cHis poise, him being able to stay calm in the pocket in pressure situations, you don\u2019t get that from a lot of rookie quarterbacks,\u201d receiver Jamison Crowder said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad, man, that he\u2019s on my team.\"",
      "The Commanders beat the New York Giants in Week 2 despite not scoring a touchdown thanks to seven field goals on seven tries from new kicker Austin Seibert. They beat Cincinnati on the road on Monday night, then won at Arizona and took care of business at home against Cleveland.",
      "A predictable defeat at AFC heavyweight Baltimore followed to bring them back to earth. Teammates recalled Daniels' anger after losing, and it filtered around the room.",
      "\u201cNobody gets down, but everybody gets (ticked) off,\u201d Way said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get sad. You just get mad and then you go back and do better.\u201d",
      "The rib injury sidelined Daniels early in a rout of Carolina, but he returned the following week to beat the Bears. Winning 27-22 at the Giants the following week to improve to 7-2 was the kind of \u201cugly game\u201d that showed players what they could do when Daniels didn't have the magic touch.",
      "\u201cIt was like, man, we\u2019re just finding a way to win,\u201d Way said. \u201cThere\u2019s just this belief.\"",
      "Daniels completed 60.98% of his passes in his first five games back. The Commanders lost three in a row in November to Pittsburgh, at Philadelphia and to Dallas.",
      "They have not lost since, are 11-5 and have the chance to think about making a playoff run just as surprising as this season.",
      "\u201cI love being part of this group of guys, and it feels awesome to obviously be able to go to the playoffs in our first year,\u201d Ertz said. \"But we also feel like we still have some room to grow, room to improve. ... We just can\u2019t rest on our laurels.\u201d",

      "The Dartmouth men\u2019s basketball team has dropped its attempt to form a union",
      "BOSTON -- The Dartmouth men\u2019s basketball team dropped its attempt to form a union on Tuesday, voluntarily ending a push to become the first college sports team to unionize in order to avoid a potentially damaging precedent from a National Labor Relations Board that soon will be controlled by Republicans.",
      "Lawyers for Service Employees International Union Local 560 withdrew their NLRB petition on Tuesday rather than take their chances in front of an unfriendly labor board.",
      "\u201cWhile our strategy is shifting, we will continue to advocate for just compensation, adequate health coverage, and safe working conditions for varsity athletes at Dartmouth,\" SEIU Local 560 President Chris Peck said in a statement that called collective bargaining \u201cthe only viable pathway to address issues\u201d facing college athletics today.",
      "The Dartmouth players petitioned the NLRB in 2023 to be allowed to unionize, saying the New Hampshire school exercised so much control over their schedules and working conditions that they met the legal definition of employees. A regional official agreed, and the team voted 13-2 in March to join SEIU Local 560, which already represents some Dartmouth workers.",
      "The school could not immediately be reached for comment. Dartmouth had previously said it would refuse to bargain with the players in an attempt to force the case into federal court.",
      "\u201cAthletes in the Ivy League are not employees,\u201d the school said in March, calling them \u201cstudents whose educational program includes athletics.\u201d",
      "A college athletes union would be unprecedented in American sports. A previous attempt to unionize the Northwestern football team failed because opponents in the Big Ten Conference include public schools that aren\u2019t under the jurisdiction of the NLRB. A separate NLRB complaint is asking that football and basketball players at Southern California be deemed employees of their school, the Pac-12 conference and the NCAA.",

      "Curious calls by Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton and Atlanta Falcons head coach Raheem Morris backfired in Week 18 and put their rookie quarterbacks and teams in precarious positions regarding the playoffs",
      "DENVER -- Count coach Sean Payton among those second-guessing his decision to go for the tie and not the win at the end of regulation in Cincinnati last weekend.",
      "\u201cOh, certainly. You go through it all the time relative to what the call would have been,\u201d Payton said Monday. \u201cBased on the outcome, you always second-guess. You always do that as a head coach. I know I kind of felt I trusted my gut at the moment, but yes, I think it\u2019s normal to do that.\u201d",
      "That was an entirely different tone than Payton had in the emotional aftermath of Denver\u2019s 30-24 overtime loss to the Bengals on Saturday when he insisted, \u201cThe decision we made was the right one.\u201d",
      "Giving the ball back to Joe Burrow, the NFL\u2019s hottest quarterback, wasn\u2019t the best of moves for the Broncos, who didn\u2019t force a single punt in regulation, something Payton acknowledged he didn't realize until it was mentioned in his postgame news conference.",
      "After throwing a 25-yard touchdown pass to Marvin Mims Jr. on fourth down with 8 seconds remaining in regulation, Broncos rookie quarterback Bo Nix held up two fingers and pleaded with his coach to go for the win. Payton scanned his play sheet.",
      "\u201cYes, I definitely want the ball and a chance to win the game,\" said Nix, who nonetheless deferred to Payton, saying those calls are the coach's.",
      "After Mims' highlight-reel catch between Geno Stone and Mike Hilton was confirmed after a lengthy review, Payton instead sent out kicker Wil Lutz for the extra point to send the game into overtime.",
      "Cincinnati's clock mismanagement had given the Broncos time to score at the end of regulation. Instead of having Burrow take a knee and forcing Denver to burn its final timeout, Bengals coach Zac Taylor called for a handoff to Chase Brown, who hurt his right ankle on an awkward slide near the end zone. Payton called his final timeout, but the injury timeout was charged to the Bengals instead.",
      "Playing for overtime backfired on the Broncos when the Bengals outgained them 119 yards to 6 yards in overtime and Burrow threw his third touchdown pass to Tee Higgins to keep Cincy's slim playoff hopes alive and deny Denver a playoff-clinching win for the second straight weekend.",
      "It also injected some intrigue into the final weekend of games before the playoffs begin. The Broncos (9-7), Bengals (8-8) and Dolphins (8-8) all are alive for the seventh and final playoff spot in the AFC race with a trip to second-seeded Buffalo on tap for the team that clinches.",
      "The Broncos host the Kansas City Chiefs (15-1), who have clinched the AFC's top seed and are expected to rest most of their starters Sunday in Denver, where a loss would eliminate the Bengals, winners of four straight, and keep the Chiefs from having to face Burrow, who is in the midst of the best season of his career.",
      "Payton wasn't the only head coach who denied his rookie QB a confidence-inspiring, all-or-nothing moment only to lose 30-24 in overtime in Week 18.",
      "It was the same fate for the Atlanta Falcons after coach Raheem Morris' questionable clock management ahead of a 56-yard field goal try by Riley Patterson that came up short at the end of regulation and sent their game against the Washington Commanders into overtime Sunday.",
      "Washington won the coin toss and Jayden Daniels drove the Commanders on a 12-play, 70-yard march that ended with his 2-yard TD toss to tight end Zach Ertz to clinch a playoff spot. That sent the Falcons (8-8) careening into Week 18 needing both a win over the Panthers and a Saints upset of the Buccaneers (9-7) to make the playoffs.",
      "Morris acknowledged after the loss he \u201cprobably could have\u201d called a timeout after Michael Penix Jr. connected with Darnell Mooney on a 25-yard completion with 40 seconds left. Instead, the clock wound down to 17 seconds because he was \u201ctrying to save that timeout.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn hindsight, it could have been a better decision to take that timeout, but I wanted to have the opportunity to move up there, so you can always second-guess those things,\" Morris said. \u201cCan always second-guess those motives. Can always go back and look at it to see if you could have snapped it a little quicker. But I really believe we can get our operation time a little faster and to save that timeout.\u201d",
      "Morris saved five of his six timeouts Sunday.",
      "Like Nix, Penix, the rookie quarterback making his second NFL start, deferred to his head coach on when to use timeouts.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s on Coach Raheem,\u201d Penix said. \u201cHe calls the timeouts whenever he feels fit. He trusted in us to get the plays off and make the next play. We all trust Coach\u2019s judgment on that, so that\u2019s what we are going to lean on.\u201d",

      "Doug Christie took over as the interim head coach of the Sacramento Kings amid a season-long losing streak, fans booing the team off their home court and questions surrounding the decision to fire Mike Brown, who led the franchise to its first playoff ...",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Doug Christie took over as the interim head coach of the Sacramento Kings amid a season-long losing streak, fans booing the team off their home court and questions surrounding the decision to fire Mike Brown, who led the franchise to its first playoff appearance in 16 years in 2023",
      "Christie got his first win at the helm on Monday with a 110-100 win over the Mavericks, a victory that meant just as much to the team\u2019s season as it did to him personally. It wasn\u2019t particularly easy, with the Kings falling behind by 18 points early to a Dallas team missing Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.",
      "In the huddle, Christie told his players: \u201cYou\u2019re getting close.\u201d He cited a Bob Marley lyric about taking a bucket to the well and not knowing when the bottom will fall out. After the Kings picked up a couple of technical fouls in the second half, Christie stressed to his players that they shouldn\u2019t allow the referees to derail the gameplan.",
      "They responded, closing the third quarter on a 17-2 run and snapping a six-game losing streak to give the 15-year NBA veteran his first win since taking over the Kings.",
      "\u201cAre we going to still struggle from time to time?\u201d Christie said. \u201cYes, but the good will needed to happen to show that lot of things that we talk about \u2014 we\u2019re able to do. Now, we need to do it with the consistency, the intensity and the violent aggression, in my opinion, that needs to be there to win games at this level.\u201d",
      "Domantas Sabonis, who had 17 points and 16 rebounds, said that seeing Christie get his first win was \u201creally cool.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve spent three summers now with him,\u201d Sabonis said. \u201cHe works his butt off and just to see him installing what he believes in the guys, and the guys reacting that quickly to it is awesome.\u201d",
      "Being an NBA head coach, even with the interim tag, hasn\u2019t yet sunk in for Christie. He had been busy with assistant coaching and scouting duties ahead of getting the promotion, planning to catch up on some sleep when the team was in Los Angeles over the weekend. Instead, he found himself at the helm against the Lakers, subsisting on 90-minute naps.",
      "Christie\u2019s initial goals are incremental: Simplifying the offense in game one, followed by the defense in game two. The Kings held the Mavericks to just 40 points in the second half.",
      "He wants the fans, who have endured 12 coaching changes since 2007 with just one playoff appearance, to know that they are appreciated, that they\u2019ll put a product on the floor that makes them proud and that they can root for players who gave it their all. From his players, he hopes for both understanding and love.",
      "\u201cThis is hard,\u201d Christie said before the game. \u201cThis is high leverage, the best in the world. There are only a certain amount of people who do it, from my perspective and the players' perspective. Whatever you say about the word \u2018pressure,\u2019 it\u2019s there.\u201d",
      "Christie said that his job involves letting his players play after putting them in a position to succeed. Part of whether he succeeds as coach will hinge on his best player, De\u2019Aaron Fox, who pushed back earlier on Monday on reports that he was involved in Brown\u2019s firing.",
      "Christie, who has been an assistant with the Kings since 2021, won two games as an interim head coach in 2022 when Brown was sick. But Monday\u2019s win was his first on a semi-permanent basis, with the expectation that he\u2019ll get the rest of the season to prove himself as a head coach.",
      "One of the aspects that Christie hopes to improve is the team\u2019s record in close contests. The Kings are 6-13 in games that are within five points in the final five minutes. He said that being \u201cclutch\u201d comes down to which team is willing to dive on the floor and \u201csacrifice themselves in a way that's going to hurt.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to that point, what are you willing to do?\u201d Christie said. \u201cI know what I\u2019m willing to do for you, and I\u2019m going to support them in any way I can. Because it\u2019ll always be my fault. It\u2019ll never be their fault. They go do their job. I\u2019m here to take the bullets.\u201d",
      "Christie said building off the win will involve understanding that turning the season around is a process and wins are a byproduct.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard in this league,\u201d Christie said. \u201cWinning is difficult. So, totally understand that. I think they\u2019re beginning to feel it, and that\u2019s going to be the process that we have to go through on a night-to-night basis. I\u2019m here for it, and I think that they\u2019re ready to do it.\u201d",

      "The injury came in the final two minutes of a 40-34 loss for San Francisco when Brian Branch brought down Purdy with a sack on a blitz. Purdy rolled over as he fell to the ground and his right elbow went right into the face mask of defensive lineman Pat O'Connor.",
      "Purdy said his elbow was initially \u201con fire\u201d and he will need to undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the injury.",

      "Purdy's injury was just the latest to hit San Francisco this season, with stars Christian McCaffrey, Trent Williams, Brandon Aiyuk, Nick Bosa and Dre Greenlaw among the many key players to be sidelined for multiple games.",
      "The situation was so dire that Purdy played Monday night behind an offensive line that featured third and fourth stringers at both left guard and left tackle.",
      "Purdy overcame that obstacle early, playing a nearly flawless first half when he threw two TD passes and ran for another score on the first three drives and posted a perfect 158.3 passer rating.",
      "\u201cWe were in a groove,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point of the game, we were just being aggressive and trying to win the game however it took. The pass game was going really well.\u201d",
      "After throwing another touchdown pass on San Francisco's first drive of the second half, Purdy struggled down the stretch, throwing two interceptions to Kerby Joseph that ended the Niners' hopes of a victory.",
      "That's the kind of season it has been for Purdy, who has been unable to match the heights he reached last season when he led the NFL with a 113 passer rating and 9.6 yards per attempt while finishing fourth in MVP voting.",
      "Purdy's numbers have taken a significant drop this season and he has 20 touchdown passes and 12 interceptions. But even with the injury and San Francisco out of playoff contention, Purdy wants to play Sunday at Arizona.",
      "\u201cI want to finish the season with our guys,\" he said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s why wouldn\u2019t I play for my team and try to get some momentum going for the next year with our guys and make a statement to everybody here and that\u2019s going to be here next year that I\u2019m a competitor?

      "Nikola Jokic also had a triple-double with 36 points, 22 rebounds and 11 assists, and Jamal Murray had 10 assists to go along with 20 points.",
      "Jordan Clarkson scored 24, and Collin Sexton had 22 for the Jazz.",
      "Utah led 66-64 at the break, but Denver outscored the Jazz 34-23 in the third to build some separation.",
      "Both teams were missing a starting forward. Denver's Aaron Gordon sat out with a right calf strain and Utah's John Collins missed his fourth straight game with a hip bruise.",
      "Nuggets: Denver struggled again when Jokic was on the bench. Once he returned in the fourth quarter, he immediately hit a 3-pointer and found Westbrook for a dunk and his 10th assist a couple minutes later.",
      "Jazz: Utah played four rookies \u2014 Kyle Filipowski, Isaiah Collier, Brice Sensabaugh and Cody Williams \u2014 with Clarkson for a key stretch in the fourth quarter and actually cut the Denver's lead to 109-107 on Filipowski's three-point play with 7:28 remaining.",
      "Westbrook stole the ball from Sexton and dunked it on the other end to give Denver a 126-114 lead with 2:46 remaining.",
      "The Jazz, who commit more turnovers than any team in the league, had 13 turnovers in the second half which led to 14 Denver points. Utah only had three in the first half.",
      "The Jazz are at New York and the Nuggets host Atlanta on Wednesday.",

      "Jared Goff threw three touchdown passes and the Detroit Lions tuned up for their Week 18 division showdown against Minnesota by beating the San Francisco 49ers 40-34",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The big prizes for the Detroit Lions remain on the horizon, with the team seeking a division title, the top seed in the NFC playoffs and the franchise's first Super Bowl trip.",
      "With almost nothing at stake in a rematch of last season's NFC championship game that Detroit lost to San Francisco, coach Dan Campbell and the Lions approached it with the same sort of ferocity that has defined his tenure.",
      "Jared Goff threw three touchdown passes and the Lions tuned up for their Week 18 division showdown against Minnesota by beating the 49ers 40-34 on Monday night.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the only way we know. It's just go and find a way to win,\u201d Goff said. \"This is what ended our season last year. There\u2019s a lot of guys on this team that were there last year that wanted to get one back on them even though in a lot of ways it was meaningless for them and it was meaningless for us.\"",
      "The stakes for this game were miniscule compared to the last meeting between the teams when a berth in the Super Bowl was on the line last January.",
      "San Francisco was eliminated from playoff contention last week and Detroit plays Minnesota in the regular-season finale next week, with the winner earning the NFC North title and top seed in the NFC playoffs, and the loser relegated to being the first 14-win wild-card team in NFL history.",
      "\u201cThis is just fairytale stuff,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "Had the Vikings lost on Sunday, Detroit could have clinched the division and No. 1 seed on Monday night. But now the win against the 49ers would only matter if Detroit and Minnesota tie in Week 18, with the Lions now set to earn the No. 1 seed in that unlikely scenario.",
      "Campbell said he considered resting some starters but decided it would be unfair to the backups who hadn't prepared and the starters who still would have had to play. It all worked out, with the Lions getting the win and coming out healthy.",
      "\u201cI ended up settling on the right thing to do was playing those guys,\u201d he said. \"We owed it to the team. ... That was tough. I think the biggest thing is there was things we wanted to do better than we did last week, and we did.\"",
      "Goff threw a go-ahead touchdown pass to Amon-Ra St. Brown in the final minute of the third quarter following the first of Kerby Joseph's two second-half interceptions against Brock Purdy.",
      "That proved to be enough for the Lions (14-2) to complete a perfect regular season away from home, beat the 49ers (6-10) on the road for the first time since 1975 and get a small bit of revenge for last season's playoff loss.",
      "\u201cI still had that chip on my shoulder from last year,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cWe were so close and we just came up short.\u201d",
      "Jahymr Gibbs put the game away with a 30-yard touchdown run with less than three minutes left following Purdy's second interception, giving him 117 yards on the night.",
      "The offenses dominated for much of the night, with the teams scoring touchdowns on the first five possessions and Purdy and Goff combining to complete the first 17 passes of the game \u2014 including a perfectly executed hook-and-ladder play that led to a 42-yard TD for Goff.",
      "He threw a short pass to St. Brown, who immediately pitched the ball to Jameson Williams, who streaked down the sideline for the final 41 yards and his second TD of the first half.",
      "The only stops of the half came when Renardo Green broke up a pass in the end zone from Goff to Sam LaPorta and when Jake Moody missed a 51-yard field goal in the closing seconds for San Francisco.",
      "Purdy threw a 5-yard pop pass for a TD on San Francisco's opening drive of the second half before Detroit's defense finally managed a stop when Joseph intercepted an overthrown pass by Purdy.",
      "Goff turned that into a 4-yard TD pass to St. Brown on fourth-and-goal to give the Lions their first lead at 31-28 late in the third quarter.",
      "Moody missed a 58-yard field goal that could have tied the game early in the fourth quarter for his ninth missed field goal of the season. Moody also missed an extra point after Joshua Dobbs scored on a TD run in the final minute.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t able to slow them down enough on defense,\u201d 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real good offense, but we still have to slow them down a little bit more. That was the difference in the game. We had to win in it in a shootout. I thought the difference was our two turnovers.\u201d",
      "Lions: RT Penei Sewell went to the locker room early at the end of the first half to get a thumb injury checked out but there is no concern about his status.",
      "49ers: Purdy left late in the fourth quarter after hurting his throwing elbow on a sack. Purdy said his elbow \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel the best\u201d but initial testing showed his surgically repaired ligament from an injury sustained in the 2022 NFC title game against Philadelphia is fine.",

      "The Atlanta Falcons have run out of time to control their path to the playoffs after mismanaging the clock multiple times in an overtime loss at the Washington Commanders",
      "LANDOVER, Md. -- Raheem Morris and the Atlanta Falcons left five timeouts unused, and they may have an extended chance to linger over those mistakes.",
      "The Falcons have run out of time to control their own path to the playoffs after mismanaging the clock multiple times in a 30-24 overtime loss to the Washington Commanders. They needed a victory to set up a win-and-get-in situation in the regular-season finale, and now Tampa Bay is in the driver's seat for the NFC South title.",
      "Morris declined to use all three of his timeouts at the end of the first half before settling for a field goal. He had two left in the waning minutes of regulation before Riley Patterson tried a 56-yard field goal attempt with two seconds left that fell short.",
      "The first-year coach acknowledged he \u201cprobably could have\u201d taken one after Michael Penix Jr. connected with Darnell Mooney on a 25-yard completion with 40 seconds left. Instead, the clock wound down to 17 seconds because he was \u201ctrying to save that timeout.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn hindsight, it could have been a better decision to take that timeout, but I wanted to have the opportunity to move up there so you can always second guess those things,' Morris said after his team's defeat that punched the Commanders' ticket to the playoffs. \"Can always second-guess those motives. Can always go back and look at it to see if you could have snapped it a little quicker. But I really believe we can get our operation time a little faster and to save that timeout.\"",
      "Questionable coaching came back to bit the Falcons, including a near-total abandonment of the running game that was picking Washington apart for much of the first half. Bijan Robinson had 13 carries for 82 yards and two touchdowns until there was one minute left before halftime, and he was handed the ball just four more times for 8 yards the rest of the way.",
      "Penix, the rookie quarterback taken with the eighth pick and making his second NFL start, pointed to a three-and-out in the third quarter as the culprit behind Atlanta becoming unbalanced. The Commanders had the ball for 12:53 and the Falcons for just 2:07 in the third.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t really have the ball much,\" said Penix, who was 19 of 35 for 223 yards, a touchdown pass to Kyle Pitts and an interception. \u201cI believe we ran three plays. We just got to sustain drives. We can\u2019t go three-and-out. Our mindset each and every time we step on the field is to get points. Whenever we have the opportunity based on that, it could have made us go one way or the other passing or running the ball.\u201d",
      "The Falcons had the chance to go up 21-7 instead of 17-7 at halftime, though Morris defended his strategy as a way to not leave Jayden Daniels and Co. the chance to get the ball back: \"Took the field goal. Got out of dodge.\u201d",
      "Penix deferred to Morris on when to use timeouts.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s on Coach Raheem,\u201d Penix said. \u201cHe calls the timeouts whenever he feels fit. He trusted in us to get the plays off and make the next play. We all trust coach\u2019s judgement on that, so that\u2019s what we are going to lean on.\u201d",
      "The Falcons must now lean on New Orleans to beat Tampa Bay. After five losses in seven games, they need that and a victory against Carolina to reach the playoffs.",

      "The New York Giants lost by winning.",
      "A rare victory \u2014 45-33 over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday \u2014 knocked the Giants out of control for the coveted No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL draft.",
      "So much for Sheduer Sanders\u2019 Giants-themed cleats unless New York trades up to get the Colorado quarterback.",
      "The Giants (3-13) dropped from first to fourth in the draft order with the Patriots (3-13) moving up to No. 1. New England doesn\u2019t need a quarterback because rookie Drake Maye has been one of the team\u2019s few bright spots this season. But the Titans (3-13) currently sit at No. 2 and they will be seeking a franchise QB at No. 2. The Browns (3-13) should do the same if they stay at No. 3. Sanders and Miami\u2019s Cam Ward won\u2019t be around if New York has to settle for the fourth pick.",
      "That\u2019s why Giants fans were angry after witnessing the team\u2019s first win at MetLife Stadium this season.",
      "\u201cThe playoff is out of contention, you understand what they\u2019re saying,\u201d quarterback Drew Lock said after throwing for 309 yards and four touchdowns. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s nice to say we\u2019re going to go work, we\u2019re going to keep doing this, we\u2019re going to keep pushing, the season\u2019s not over, we\u2019ve got two games left to be able to come out and win this one - that\u2019s the goal every single week, come out and win and work as hard as we can to do it.",
      "Players aren\u2019t going to tank football games. It\u2019s a violent, physical sport and it would be dangerous to play to lose. Plus, there\u2019s too much pride involved and other factors. Guys are playing for contracts and there are few job guarantees in the NFL.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re obviously not tanking,\u201d said wide receiver Darius Slayton, who screamed an expletive about tanking after catching a 32-yard TD pass. \u201cAt the end of the day, we have a job to do. This isn\u2019t basketball, it\u2019s not golf, it\u2019s not tennis. Football, you get hit, so I\u2019m not (going to) go out there and just let people tee off on me just to tank.\u201d",
      "Getting coaches on board to play not to win would be a tough task, too. Brian Daboll has no incentive to care about draft positioning if his job status is uncertain. General manager Joe Schoen also could be fired so this decision should have come from the top. Start a third-string quarterback and bench key starters. That\u2019s how teams give themselves a better opportunity to lose.",
      "The Giants didn\u2019t do that. The repercussions of this victory could set the organization back a few years if New York doesn\u2019t end up with a franchise quarterback.",
      "That\u2019s not Daboll\u2019s concern. He breathed a sigh of relief after the Giants avoided becoming the first team to go 0-9 at home.",
      "\u201cI see these coaches every day come in and are consistent. It\u2019s hard to be consistent in an inconsistent league when things go. ... It\u2019s not great,\u201d Daboll said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a good record. I firmly acknowledge that and I accept responsibility for that. But their commitment to doing things the right way, day in and day out, staying late and putting together plans much like the players when we\u2019re down and we got two wins. We have the right kind of people. It was good to get a win at home, I\u2019ll say that. It was good to get a win at home. But it means more to me for the players and the coaches.\u201d",
      "Las Vegas, another team that needs a franchise quarterback, was in contention for the top pick before winning consecutive games. Now, the Raiders (4-12) are sitting at No. 8.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t do this to lose,\u201d Raiders coach Antonio Pierce said last week. \u201cWe don\u2019t do this for anybody\u2019s fantasy football team. Don\u2019t do this for anybody\u2019s draft projections. None of that (stuff) matters to us. What matters is winning, and that\u2019s all we want to do.\u201d",

      "The Rose Bowl between eighth-seeded Ohio State and top-seeded Oregon in a College Football Playoff quarterfinal has many subplots for Chip Kelly",
      "Of all the things Chip Kelly is looking forward to in his return trip to Southern California, there is one that rises above everything else.",
      "\u201cGotta get more sunscreen looking at the weather report, because we haven\u2019t seen the sun for a little while in Columbus,\" said Kelly with a wry smile.",
      "The eighth-seeded Buckeyes will face top-seeded Oregon on Wednesday in the Rose Bowl in a College Football Playoff quarterfinal matchup. The game in the venerable stadium is a homecoming for Kelly, who resigned from UCLA in February after six seasons to become Ohio State\u2019s offensive coordinator.",
      "Kelly had a 35-34 record with the Bruins, including 25-13 in his final three seasons. UCLA though appeared to reach its ceiling under Kelly after going 8-5 last season when it was expected to contend for a title in its final season in the Pac-12.",
      "Kelly was on the hot seat a year ago going into the Southern California game, but a 38-20 victory appeared to give him another season. But Kelly said coaching quarterbacks leading up to the LA Bowl after staff departures made him realize that he enjoyed being in the position meeting rooms more than overseeing an entire program.",
      "After pursuing a couple NFL assistant openings, Kelly decided to reunite with longtime friend Ryan Day.",
      "\"I had a great time when I was at UCLA. I had a great staff and an unbelievable group of players there, too. I think as a head coach, you wear a lot of different hats. Obviously, as a coordinator and just coaching the quarterbacks, it\u2019s a little bit different,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun. I've enjoyed being back in the meeting room with the players on a day-to-day basis. As a head coach, you bounced around to different meeting rooms, but as the coordinator, you\u2019re with the quarterbacks all the time, so I really enjoyed that aspect of it.\u201d",
      "With Kelly calling the plays, Ohio State is 11th in the nation in scoring offense, averaging 36 points, and 32nd in total offense at 427.3 yards a game.",
      "Quarterback Will Howard, tied with Oregon's Dillon Gabriel for second nationally with a 73.2% completion rate, grew up as a Philadelphia Eagles fan, where Kelly coached for two-plus seasons (2013-15). Gabriel was surprised but also thought it was cool when Kelly brought up Eagles clips to study in the quarterback room.",
      "\u201cThe more that this year has gone on, I feel like we\u2019re in sync right now. We both kind of see things the same way sometimes,\u201d said Howard, who has thrown for 29 touchdowns and nine interceptions. \u201cWe're also able to have that healthy discussion of what do you like here? What do you not like here? I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed my time working with him.\u201d",
      "Day said that he has also seen Kelly's comfort level increase as he has developed a better understanding of Ohio State's personnel as well as going through the Big Ten for the first time.",
      "Day also noted that he was happy with the Buckeyes' balance in their 42-17 victory over Tennessee in the first round Dec. 21. Howard completed 24 of 29 passes for 311 yards with two touchdowns and an interception, while the running game had 156 yards and averaged 4.7 yards per carry.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got a great understanding of the entire game of football, offensive football, whether it\u2019s wide open and spread and tempo or getting with multiple tight ends in the game, huddling, different styles of play, and he\u2019s always said, and we\u2019ve always said that the No. 1 job of the coordinator is to put the offense in the best position to be successful.\u201d",
      "Coming back to the Rose Bowl isn't the only connection Kelly has to the game. He was Oregon's head coach from 2009 through '12, and had a 46-7 record before leaving for the NFL. Kelly is winless in six games against the Ducks, including a 32-31 loss in Eugene in prime time Oct. 12.",
      "Kelly said the offensive staff has reviewed all 13 Oregon games from this season.",
      "Ducks defensive end Jordan Burch did not play in the first meeting, which is one of the biggest differences on defense. The other is that the first game took place in the middle of the season as both teams have played seven games since then.",
      "\u201cI think every game is different. It\u2019s always the matchups and the individual matchups, our offensive line versus their defensive line, which I think is one of the best lines in the country,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cOur job is to put these guys in position to make plays and then let them go play. We've got a great group from that standpoint that is a joy to coach because of how they approach every single day.\u201d",

      "LANDOVER, Md. -- Jayden Daniels felt tired. Tired from a game that went well past 60 minutes. Tired from running all over the field for the better part of three-plus hours.",
      "It was all worth it after carrying the Washington Commanders into the playoffs.",
      "Daniels connected with Zach Ertz in overtime for his third touchdown pass of the game to clinch a playoff spot by beating the Atlanta Falcons 30-24 in overtime Sunday night in a back-and-forth prime-time showdown between highly drafted rookie quarterbacks.",
      "\u201cThe fan base waited a long time for this,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cI really can\u2019t put into words how much it means to them and how much it means to me to be able to go out there and lead this franchise and this team to opportunities like that.\u201d",
      "Daniels ran for a season-high 127 yards, including 42 in OT, and completed 24 of 36 passes for 227 yards and had two TD passes to Ertz and another to Olamide Zaccheaus to make the playoffs in his rookie year.",
      "In his latest comeback performance in a season full of them, the No. 2 overall pick in the draft in April shook off an interception and a 10-point halftime deficit and led the winning drive in overtime that was capped with the 2-yard pass to Ertz.",
      "\u201cYou want to be in these moments,\u201d said veteran linebacker Bobby Wagner, who saw a look in Daniels' eyes late in the game that foreshadowed another winning performance. \u201cHim getting hit and making big plays, his confidence, his demeanor never changes. You know that he knows he\u2019s going to make a play, and everybody on the sideline and on the field believes he\u2019s going to make a play.\u201d",
      "The Commanders (11-5) could move up to the sixth seed in the NFC and set up a wild-card round game at Tampa Bay or the Los Angeles Rams if they win their regular-season finale at Dallas next weekend. They otherwise would be seventh and visit division-rival Philadelphia unless Green Bay loses to Chicago.",

      "\u201cControl what your controllables are,\u201d Atlanta coach Raheem Morris said. \u201cGo out there and win our football game. That\u2019s all we can do. Everything else is out of our control. Those things don\u2019t matter. Thing we got to do is prepare for this football game. Prepare for the Panthers.\u201d",
      "Atlanta was in control for the first half of the game, gashing Washington\u2019s defense with the running game until abandoning it. Bijan Robinson had 82 yards and two touchdown runs on 13 carries until a minute was left in the second quarter \u2014 but had just 8 yards the rest of the way.",
      "Penix did his best to try to carry the Falcons back after they fell behind 24-17 late. The eighth pick in the draft made his second professional start and finished a 12-play, 68-yard drive with a touchdown pass to Kyle Pitts to tie it with 1:19 left.",
      "A throw from Penix to Drake London drew a pass interference penalty with 2 seconds left in regulation and gave Riley Patterson a chance at a go-ahead field goal. But Patterson's 56-yard attempt fell short as time expired and Atlanta never got the ball back.",
      "\u201cWe just went back to our technique and fundamentals: Keep it simple for stopping the run and keep it on the passing game,\u201d Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu said. \u201cShout out to the quarterback, man. He threw a couple balls at the end of the game. He\u2019s a hell of a player, man, and pulse of that team and they fought. It\u2019s always a fight with them.\"",

      "Thompson and Herro became entangled with Miami about to inbound the ball leading 99-94 with 35 seconds left. Thompson grabbed Herro by the jersey and tossed him, with referee Marc Davis describing it as Thompson \u201cbody slams Herro.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see it live, but I re-watched it,\u201d Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. \u201cThey were in each other\u2019s face, bumping chests a little bit, and one guy\u2019s stronger than the other.\u201d",

      "The win for Miami came 24 hours after losing 120-110 in Atlanta. The Heat were missing second-leading scorer Jimmy Butler for a fifth straight game, so Herro was proud of his team played against one of NBA\u2019s best teams this season.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re top two, three in the West,\u201d Herro said. \u201cVery good defense. Got a bunch of young, athletic guys that can really play, so that\u2019s a good win for us. That\u2019s a stepping stone. We go 2-1 on the road. Put ourselves in a position to win yesterday, and I like how it\u2019s going. We just got to continue to keep getting better.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue.",
      "The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act\u2019s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,\u201d said Trump\u2019s amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice for solicitor general.",
      "The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table.",
      "He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral.",
      "He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it.",
      "The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards.",
      "Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and \u201cseeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\u201d",
      "In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on \u201calleged \u2018risks\u2019 that China could exercise control\u201d over TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates.",
      "The Biden administration has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok\u2019s legal filing said, adding that the U.S. fears are predicated on future risks.",
      "In its filing Friday, the Biden administration said because TikTok \u201cis integrated with ByteDance and relies on its propriety engine developed and maintained in China,\u201d its corporate structure carries with it risk."

      "An online spat between factions of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in the president-elect\u2019s political movement into public display",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- An online spat between factions of Donald Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House.",
      "The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump's movement \u2014 wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry \u2014 and people in Trump's Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies.",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump\u2019s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \u201cnot America First policy\u201d and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \u201cWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect, was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump's movement but his stance on the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers.",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "\u201cThere is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,\" he said in a post. \u201cIt is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.\u201d",
      "Trump's own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement.",
      "His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "Trump's businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club, and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers.",
      "During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\" and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges.",
      "\u201cI think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" he told the \u201cAll-In\" podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world.",
      "Those comments came on the cusp of Trump's budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes."

      "WASHINGTON -- A ninth U.S. telecoms firm has been confirmed to have been hacked as part of a sprawling Chinese espionage campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, a top White House official said Friday.",
      "Biden administration officials said this month that at least eight telecommunications companies, as well as dozens of nations, had been affected by the Chinese hacking blitz known as Salt Typhoon.",
      "But deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger told reporters Friday that a ninth victim had been identified after the administration released guidance to companies about how to hunt for Chinese culprits in their networks.",
      "The update from Neuberger is the latest development in a massive hacking operation that has alarmed national security officials, exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the private sector and laid bare China's hacking sophistication.",
      "The hackers compromised the networks of telecommunications companies to obtain customer call records and gain access to the private communications of what officials have said is a a limited number of individuals. Though the FBI has not publicly identified any of the victims, officials believe senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures are among those whose whose communications were accessed.",
      "Neuberger said Friday that officials did not yet have a precise sense how many Americans overall were affected by Salt Typhoon, in part because the Chinese were careful about their techniques, but that a \u201clarge number\" were in the Washington-Virginia area.",
      "Officials believe the goal of the hackers was to identify who owned the phones and, if they were \u201cgovernment targets of interest,\u201d spy on their texts and phone calls, she said.",
      "The FBI said most of the people targeted by the hackers are \"primarily involved in government or political activity.\u201d",
      "Neuberger said the episode highlighted the need for required cybersecurity practices in the telecommunications industry, something the Federal Communications Commission is to take up at a meeting next month. In addition, she said, the government was planning additional actions in coming weeks in response to the hacking campaign, though she did not say what they were.",
      "\u201cWe know that voluntary cyber security practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,\u201d she said.",
      "The Chinese government has denied responsibility for the hacking."

      "Scientists say human-caused climate change added an average of 41 days of dangerous heat worldwide in 2024",
      "People around the world suffered an average of 41 extra days of dangerous heat this year because of human-caused climate change, according to a group of scientists who also said that climate change worsened much of the world's damaging weather throughout 2024.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central researchers comes at the end of a year that shattered climate record after climate record as heat across the globe made 2024 likely to be its hottest ever measured and a slew of other fatal weather events spared few.",
      "\u201cThe finding is devastating but utterly unsurprising: Climate change did play a role, and often a major role in most of the events we studied, making heat, droughts, tropical cyclones and heavy rainfall more likely and more intense across the world, destroying lives and livelihoods of millions and often uncounted numbers of people,\u201d Friederike Otto, the lead of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College climate scientist, said during a media briefing on the scientists' findings. \u201cAs long as the world keeps burning fossil fuels, this will only get worse.\u201d",
      "Millions of people endured stifling heat this year. Northern California and Death Valley baked. Sizzling daytime temperatures scorched Mexico and Central America. Heat endangered already vulnerable children in West Africa. Skyrocketing southern European temperatures forced Greece to close the Acropolis. In South and Southeast Asian countries, heat forced school closures. Earth experienced some of the hottest days ever measured and its hottest-yet summer, with a 13-month heat streak that just barely broke.",
      "To do its heat analysis, the team of volunteer international scientists compared daily temperatures around the globe in 2024 to the temperatures that would have been expected in a world without climate change. The results are not yet peer-reviewed, but researchers use peer-reviewed methods.",
      "Some areas saw 150 days or more of extreme heat due to climate change.",
      "\u201cThe poorest, least developed countries on the planet are the places that are experiencing even higher numbers,\u201d said Kristina Dahl, vice president of climate science at Climate Central.",
      "What's worse, heat-related deaths are often underreported.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to die in heat waves. But if we can\u2019t communicate convincingly, \u2018but actually a lot of people are dying,\u2019 it\u2019s much harder to raise this awareness,\u201d Otto said. \u201cHeat waves are by far the deadliest extreme event, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real game changer.\u201d",
      "This year was a warning that the planet is getting dangerously close to the Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit compared to the pre-industrial average, according to the scientists. Earth is expected to soon edge past that threshold, although it's not considered to have been breached until that warming is sustained over decades.",
      "The researchers closely examined 29 extreme weather events this year that killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions, and found that 26 of them had clear links to climate change.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather around the world, made some of this weather more likely earlier in the year. But the researchers said most of their studies found that climate change played a bigger role than that phenomenon in fueling 2024's events. Warm ocean waters and warmer air fueled more destructive storms, according to the researchers, while temperatures led to many record-breaking downpours.",
      "Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, said the science and findings were sound.",
      "\u201cExtreme weather will continue to become more frequent, intense, destructive, costly, and deadly, until we can lower the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere,\" she said.",
      "Significantly more climate extremes could be expected without action, the United Nations Environment Programme said in the fall, as more planet-warming carbon dioxide has been sent into the air this year by burning fossil fuels than last year.",
      "But the deaths and damages from extreme weather events aren't inevitable, said Julie Arrighi, director of programmes at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and part of the research.",
      "\u201cCountries can reduce those impacts by preparing for climate change and adapting for climate change, and while the challenges faced by individual countries or systems or places vary around the world, we do see that every country has a role to play,\" she said.",

      "\u201cI definitely thought that I had had my fix of owls with the first one,\" said Whelan, 22, a Lake Superior Zoo guest experience manager who graduated earlier this year with a biology and environmental science degree.",
      "\u201cI could tell he was having a hard time with one of his eyes,\" she said. \u201cI kind of took my time and just sat there with him and talked quietly and was just kind of trying to coax him to trust me a little bit.\u201d",

      "The Quadrantid meteor shower will be the year\u2019s first chance to see fireballs in the sky",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the Quadrantid meteor shower peaks on Friday, it will be the year's first chance to see fireballs in the sky.",
      "A waning crescent moon means good visibility under clear and dark conditions.",
      "Most meteor showers are named for the constellations where they appear to originate from in the night sky. But the Quadrantids \u201ctake their name from a constellation that doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d said NASA's William Cooke.",
      "These meteors usually don't have long trains, but the heads may appear as bright fireballs. The peak may reveal as many as 120 meteors per hour, according to NASA.",
      "Viewing lasts until Jan. 16. Here\u2019s what to know about the Quadrantids and other meteor showers.",
      "As the Earth orbits the sun, several times a year it passes through debris left by passing comets \u2014 and sometimes asteroids. The source of the Quadrantids is debris from the asteroid 2003 EH1.",
      "When these fast-moving space rocks enter Earth's atmosphere, the debris encounters new resistance from the air and becomes very hot, eventually burning up.",
      "Sometimes the surrounding air glows briefly, leaving behind a fiery tail \u2014 the end of a \"shooting star.\"",
      "You don\u2019t need special equipment to see the various meteor showers that flash across annually, just a spot away from city lights.",
      "The best time to watch a meteor shower is in the early predawn hours, when the moon is low in the sky.",
      "Competing sources of light \u2014 such as a bright moon or artificial glow \u2014 are the main obstacles to a clear view of meteors. Cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest are optimal viewing opportunities.",
      "And keep looking up, not down. Your eyes will be better adapted to spot shooting stars if you aren\u2019t checking your phone.",
      "The Quadrantids will peak on a night with a slim crescent moon, just 11% full.",
      "The next meteor shower, the Lyrids, will peak in mid-April.",

      "The woman was named as 61-year-old Debrina Kawam of New Jersey.",
      "A woman who died after being set on fire on a New York City subway train this month has been identified, according to police.",
      "The woman was named as 61-year-old Debrina Kawam of Toms River, New Jersey, the New York Police Department said.",
      "Kawam was sleeping on a stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn on the morning of Dec. 22 when she was set ablaze allegedly by an undocumented 33-year-old Guatemalan citizen, according to police.",
      "The suspect, Sebastian Zapeta, has been charged with first-degree and second-degree murder and first-degree arson. He has yet to enter a plea.",
      "\"The depravity of this horrific crime is beyond comprehension, and my office is committed to bringing the perpetrator to justice,\" Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said in a statement released shortly after the homicide occurred. \"This gruesome and senseless act of violence against a vulnerable woman will be met with the most serious consequences.\"",
      "The suspect allegedly \"approached and lit the victim on fire\" with a lighter, police said.",
      "Police officers in the area at the time smelled smoke and went to the train to investigate, where they found the woman standing inside the car \"fully engulfed in flames,\" the NYPD said. She was pronounced dead at the scene.",
      "Images of the suspect were captured on officers' body cameras as he stayed on the scene after the incident, sitting on a nearby bench, according to police.",
      "Those images were released as police requested the public's assistance in identifying the man.",
      "Three high school students recognized the suspect and contacted police.",
      "Zapeta was taken into custody in a subway car at Herald Square within hours of the incident, according to police. When he was captured, the suspect had a lighter in his pocket.",
      "A motive for the crime remains under investigation.",
      "Zapeta was initially removed from the U.S. back to Guatemala in June 2018 after U.S. Border Patrol encountered him in Sonoita, Arizona, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson said. He unlawfully reentered the United States at an unknown time and location, the spokesperson said.",
      "ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations will lodge an immigration detainer with the NYPD location where Zapeta is being held, an agency spokesperson said.",
      "During a news conference on Tuesday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Kawam briefly stayed in a city homeless shelter. He said authorities have been in contact with her next of kin, but he released no additional information about her.",
      "\"Our hearts go out to the family,\" Adams said, calling the homicide a \"horrific incident to have to live through.\"",
      "He said such high-profile \"random acts of violence\" have overshadowed the success police have achieved in bringing crime down in the subway system. NYPD crime statistics show that as of Sunday, overall crime in the subway system is down 5.4% compared to last year.",
      "\"It was just a bad incident and it impacts on how New Yorkers feel,\" said Adams. \"But it really reinforces what I've been saying: People should not be living on our subway system. They should be in a place of care. And no matter where she lived, that should not have happened.",

    "story": [
      "Journalist Ernie Suggs discusses the former president's life and work.",
      "Tributes are pouring in for former President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday at the age of 100. His life and legacy will be celebrated in Washington, D.C., Atlanta and in Carter\u2019s hometown of Plains, Georgia, over the coming days.",
      "Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Ernie Suggs covered Carter and the work of the Carter Center -- which Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn Carter founded after his defeat in the 1980 election -- in advancing human rights and alleviating human suffering.",
      "On Monday, ABC News' Stephanie Ramos spoke to Suggs about the former president's work, his character and his relationship with the people of Georgia.",
      "ABC NEWS: Now we want to turn to someone who knew Carter well. Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Ernie Suggs covered Carter and developed a close personal relationship with the former president. Sir, thank you so much for speaking with us as we bid farewell today. What are some of your personal memories that you're remembering the most?",
      "SUGGS: Well, thank you for having me, for one. Personally, he was the person that I have always looked up to. I always told a story about, in 1976, my mother voted for Jimmy Carter. She campaigned for him in Brooklyn, New York. And we voted in PS 241 in Brooklyn, New York. And I always told him that story.",
      "So one of the last times we talked, I didn't mention it, you know. For some reason, I just didn't mention it, I don't know what we were talking about. And he mentioned it. He said \"How's your mother doing? How's she doing?\" And I said -- at the time my mother wasn't doing too well -- \"She's sick.\" She had been battling dementia.",
      "And he told me about, you know, he reiterated the work that Rosalynn Carter was doing with mental health. And he asked me if my mother could talk on the phone. And I said, sure, you know, she could talk. And he called my mother and he called my mother out of the blue to talk to her, just to kind of give her some words of encouragement as she was dealing with this illness and an illness that eventually his wife Rosalynn had.",
      "So I think that's the kind of example of a person who's compassionate, who loves humanity, who loves people. And I tell that story as if it's unique, but it's not because he has done that kind of work and he's done those kind of things for so many people, for so many, for 100 years. And for that I'm proud.",
      "ABC NEWS: Absolutely. Such a wonderful example of what type of man he was and what type of life he led. You touched on this a bit, that in the decades after he left office, Jimmy Carter continued to carry so much influence around the world and he continued to do so much work.",
      "As you covered him in those years, what else stood out to you from that work that he was able to do over, over really decades?",
      "SUGGS: One of the things that he said he wanted to see before he died was the eradication of the Guinea worm disease. And that disease is down to about four people now. And when he started this, thousands of people were suffering from this horrible disease. Now it's down to four, about four people. So it's going to be eradicated in a couple of years. So this is the kind of work that Jimmy Carter did post-presidency.",
      "The first line of his obituary that I wrote says that he was the 39th president of the United States. I'm sure that's the first line that you wrote in your obituary. But I think that if you ask him, his most enduring legacy is what he did after the presidency and what he continued to do up until his 100th birthday to kind of promote humanity and to promote decency and to give to others.",
      "ABC NEWS: And on that list of achievements, and you've written about some of those achievements, you've written that Carter grew up or grew into a politician who shaped race relations, but before that, he was shaped by, by then growing up in the Jim Crow South.",
      "So how do you think those early experiences shaped his worldview and his approach to others throughout his life?",
      "SUGGS: I think that had a tremendous effect. He was born in 1924. We have to understand that. So he was born prior to the Great Depression. He was born in the segregated South.",
      "One perfect example was in 1954 when he left the Navy to return to Plains to take over his father's business. He was the only white businessman in Plains, Georgia, who was not a member of the Citizens' Council. We know what the Citizens' Council is -- it's basically the Ku Klux Klan.",
      "They came to his store and said, \"Hey, we're going to boycott you unless you join the Citizens' Council. We will even pay your $5.\" And he said, \"I'd rather throw my $5 down the toilet then give you $5 to join this racist organization.\"",
      "So even in 1954, even owning a business in that rural, tiny Plains, Georgia, he rebuked the temptation to join basically the klan or the Citizens' Council because of who he was and how he grew up and the people who was around him when he grew up.",
      "ABC NEWS: And after a hundred years, we're hearing so many stories, so many new stories in the last 24 hours about his life -- that's a story I hadn't heard before. So thank you for sharing that. Since news of his passing last night, you've been speaking with people in Plains, Georgia, where Jimmy Carter is from and in other parts of Georgia. What are you hearing from them? What are they sharing with you?",
      "SUGGS: People in Plains, Georgia, if you come by this town, they love him. If you go to anyone's house in Plains, Georgia, they have a story about Jimmy Carter or \"Mr. Jimmy,\" as they called him.",
      "Everyone's house you go to has a photograph of Jimmy Carter, and it's not a photograph of him from the White House or it's not a standard portrait. It's a photograph that they've taken with their Polaroid cameras or their selfies of him on their porch, eating peanuts and laughing and joking around, shucking corn.",
      "So that's who he was. He was Mr. Jimmy. He was truly a man of the people, who happened to one day have served as the 39th president of the United States.",
      "ABC NEWS: He really was a man of the people. What a remarkable life and what an impact Jimmy Carter had on this country and those who had the pleasure of meeting him and knowing him. Ernie Suggs, thank you so much for speaking with us today. Thank you so much for your insights.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump on Monday threw his support behind Speaker Mike Johnson amid a fight over the House gavel that will culminate in a vote at the end of the week.",
      "\"Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hard working, religious man,\" Trump wrote at the end of a lengthy social media post. \"He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement.\"",
      "The endorsement is an early win for Johnson, whose speakership hangs in the balance. An endorsement from Trump could persuade hardliners to fall in with Johnson prior to the certification of the 2024 election on Jan. 6.",
      "With Republicans holding one of the smallest House majorities in history, every single vote counts. If all members are present and voting, Johnson can only afford to lose two members of his conference to retain his gavel when the House returns to session on Friday.",
      "But with the recent resignation of former Rep. Matt Gaetz, the total number of the House will be 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. This means, Johnson\u2019s can afford only one defection and a second would block him from getting the gavel. At least one Republican has already said he won't support Johnson and others are on the fence.",
      "The speaker vote comes after several House Republicans grew frustrated with Johnson during the final days of the 118th Congress, which saw a bitter fight over spending that nearly caused a government shutdown before Christmas.",
      "Billionaire Elon Musk, who was tapped by Trump to run the new \"Department of Government Efficiency,\u201d started the infighting when he trashed the bipartisan funding bill in a post on X as the House prepared to vote on the measure. Trump later in the day issued a statement opposing the bill and saying he wanted the funding bill to either raise or eliminate the nation's debt ceiling before his inauguration on Jan. 20, a demand that Musk endorsed.",
      "The bipartisan bill ultimately failed. A bill that included Trump's debt ceiling demands also failed. A third attempt that included $100 billion for disaster aid, $30 billion for farmers and a one-year extension of the farm bill, provisions that were in the original measure, passed 38 minutes past the deadline on Dec. 21.",
      "Musk on Monday also backed Johnson, writing on X, \"I feel the same way! You have my full support,\" in response to Johnson thanking Trump for his endorsement.",
      "Notably, neither Trump or Musk's endorsements mentioned the debt ceiling, but their backing was welcome news for Johnson.",
      "In his post, Trump also boasted about his successful 2024 White House run, praising Republicans for running a \u201clegendary\u201d campaign while railing against President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "He urged Republicans to \"not blow\" an opportunity for a \"relief\" from the outgoing administration -- calling for Republicans to support Johnson.",

      "In 1986, Guinea worm disease afflicted 3.5 million people every year in 21 African and Asian countries. Disease incidence has since been reduced by 99.99%, to just 14 \"provisional\" human cases in 2023, according to the Carter Center.",
      "Jacobson said that success is even more remarkable because there are no vaccines available to prevent Guinea worm disease and no drugs to treat it. Tracking Guinea worm disease, according to Jacobson, involves following possible cases for a year to determine if they are infected, checking to see if infected humans have any infected water sources near them, and monitoring the community as a whole.",
      "\"To think that you could eradicate a disease without any tools is really still just a crazy idea, but he did it with perseverance and working with people in the grassroots within communities and putting together teams of people to go and work with people in those communities and empower the communities,\" Jacobson said.",
      "The Carter Center says if efforts are successful, Guinea worm disease could become the second human disease in history to be completely eradicated, after smallpox, and the first to be done without the use of a vaccine or medicine.",
      "Carter told ABC News during the 2015 interview that eradicating the disease entirely was his goal: \"I think this is going to be a great achievement for, not for me, but for the people that have been afflicted and for the entire world to see diseases like this eradicated.\"",
      "Mass drug distribution for river blindness",
      "The Carter Center also works to fight other preventable diseases, including the parasitic infections schistosomiasis and lymphatic filariasis \u2013 more commonly known as snail fever and elephantiasis, respectively \u2013 as well as trachoma, which is one of the world's leading causes of preventable blindness. It's also working with the governments of Haiti and the Dominican Republic to eliminate lymphatic filariasis and malaria from the island of Hispaniola, which both countries share and which is \"the last reservoir in the Caribbean for both diseases,\" according to the Carter Center.",
      "Carter and his organization also played a part in organizing a major drug-donation program to help eliminate onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, which is transmitted to human through repeated bites of infected blackflies, according to the CDC.",
      "Pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. had been implementing field studies in Africa which showed that the drug ivermectin was effective at treating river blindness in humans. The Carter Center partnered with Merck to mass-distribute ivermectin, brand name Mectizan, \"as much as needed for as long as needed\" in Africa and Latin America. To date, the Carter Center has assisted in distributing more than 500 million treatments of Mectizan, according to Merck.",
      "In 1995, Carter negotiated a two-month cease-fire in Sudan to allow health care workers there to more safely help eradicate Guinea worm disease, prevent river blindness, and vaccinate children against polio.",
      "\"When we have known solutions, it is ethical to make sure they're available to the people who need it most,\" Dr. Usha Ramakrishnan, chair of the Department of Global Health at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, told ABC News. \"And that's where we were with river blindness. There was a treatment, but improving access to medications, making it affordable, reaching the people they need was very much along the lines of the work [the Carter Center] was doing.\"",
      "Addressing mental health",
      "Carter was also committed to tackling mental health issues. During his presidency, he created the Presidential Commission on Mental Health, which recommended a national plan to care for people with chronic mental illness.",
      "Although it was never adopted as policy by the Reagan administration, the plan's recommended strategies were adopted by some mental health advocacy groups to \"make gains in the 1980s,\" according to one study.",
      "Carter also signed into law the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980, which provided funding to community mental health centers.",
      "After his presidency, Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter continued working to improve access to mental health.",
      "Ramakrishnan said the Carters' work helped to reduce some of the stigma associated with mental health.",
      "\"There continues to be a lot of stigma, but they truly got it out [in] the conversation and mainstreaming mental health as an important aspect of health and well-being,\" Ramakrishnan said. \"There's still a lot of challenges, and there are many capable people that they have mentored and trained who are carrying that mantle forward.\"",

      "Former President Jimmy Carter earned a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 which, at the time, seemed to cap his decades of dedication to international humanitarian work after leaving the White House.",
      "Instead, he continued to work for years after -- a legacy that is drawing renewed attention in the wake of his death at age 100.",
      "After serving one term as president and losing his reelection bid to Ronald Reagan, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, founded an eponymous organization in Georgia dedicated to conflict resolution and advancing human rights, public health and democracy around the world.",
      "The Carter Center, the main vehicle for the Carters' work, was founded in 1982, the year after he left the White House.",
      "Jimmy Carter's advocacy for peaceful resolutions to global conflicts helped burnish his reputation as a global statesman, a commitment he underscored when receiving the Nobel on Dec. 10, 2002.",

      "Among other accomplishments, the center highlights work monitoring 113 elections across 39 countries. Specifically, the center recently observed elections in Myanmar, Bolivia, the Ivory Coast, Guyana, Tunisia and Nepal and currently runs projects to expand women's access to information in Liberia, Bangladesh and Guatemala.",

      "\"What I derive from this is a commitment to peace, to the honoring of international law,\" Jimmy Carter said on Oct. 11, 2002 after he was announced as the prize's winner that year.",
      "Building off of Jimmy Carter's success in the White House in establishing a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, the center ultimately became a diplomatic broker outside of the government's official channels, with the former president himself meeting world leaders in places like North Korea, where in 1994 he helped establish a pact between Washington and Pyongyang on nuclear issues.",
      "Besides democracy promotion and conflict resolution, the center has also long been involved in several global health programs, including fighting Guinea worm, river blindness, trachoma, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis and malaria.",
      "\"We believe access to health care is a human right, especially among poor people afflicted with disease who are forgotten, ignored, and often without hope,\" Jimmy Carter said in a quote featured on the center's website. \"Just to know that someone cares about them not only can ease their physical pain but also remove an element of alienation and anger that can lead to hatred and violence.\"",
      "Those efforts helped lead to the unanimous decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2002 to award the peace prize to the former president.",

      "\"Among all the possible choices, I decided that the most serious and universal problem is the growing chasm between the richest and poorest people on earth. Citizens of the ten wealthiest countries are now seventy-five times richer than those who live in the ten poorest ones, and the separation is increasing every year, not only between nations but also within them,\" he said in 2002.",

      "After his resounding defeat to Ronald Reagan in 1980, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter returned to Plains. Instead of resting on their laurels, they threw themselves into humanitarian work, joining forces with Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit group founded in 1976 by a Christian couple named Millard and Linda Fuller, with the stated mission of \"seeking to put God's love into action\" by building homes for people in need.",
      "\"Habitat provides a simple but powerful avenue for people of different backgrounds to come together to achieve those most meaningful things in life.

      "He also revealed in the interview that he and his wife argued like most couples, but decided long ago never to go to bed angry with each other.",
      "\"Every night we try to make sure that we are completely reconciled from all the arguments during the day when we go to bed,\" he said.",

      "Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, had been \"been champions and groundbreaking voices for affordable, decent housing for all\" since 1984, according to Habitat for Humanity. The Carters donated their time and influence and worked with nearly 103,000 volunteers in 14 countries to build, renovate and repair 4,331 homes, the nonprofit stated.",
      "Rhode Island-based builder and designer Kenneth Young, 66, first began volunteering with Habitat for Humanity in the 1990s. After his first \"Carter build\" in 1995 in Watts, California, a neighborhood in southern Los Angeles, he \"got the bug,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Since then, Young has carried out 20 builds, many alongside the 39th president of the United States -- including Carter's last build in Nashville in 2019, Young said.",
      "Young's favorite memory of Carter was during a build in Budapest, Hungary, in 1996, when the residents of a newly built home -- twin boy toddlers -- smacked him in the face with a balloon and Carter, a grandfather himself, \"took in it stride\" and with a smile.",
      "\"It was classic,\" Young said.",
      "Don Shaw and Thomas Trumble -- lifelong friends who have been volunteering together for decades with the Habitat for Humanity chapter in Hartford, Connecticut, first worked with Carter in 2002 during a build in Durban, South Africa, they told ABC News.",
      "Much of the focus of the build was reconciliation from apartheid, and the project was part of Carter's aim to build 1,000 homes in Africa, Shaw said.",
      "Shaw and Trumble went on to join Carter on builds in Mexico, India, Thailand, Canada and twice in Haiti, they said. They were also with Carter during his last build in Nashville.",
      "The volunteers were often on a first-name basis with Carter, who made them feel like they were part of his \"inner-circle,\" Shaw said.",
      "Although Carter's celebrity and political status often brought a media circus and extra funding, the former president also knew how to get his hands dirty, the volunteers said.",
      "On the job site, Carter was a natural leader, Young said.",
      "Carter's presence alone was enough inspire everyone to work hard and efficiently. The builds run by the Carters were \"a logistical miracle,\" Shaw said, adding that it was often astonishing to see how many homes the group could build within a mere week.",
      "\"President Carter, also being a Navy man, and having that military background., he wants it right. He wants it done properly. And he wants it on time,\" Young said.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 10:11:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Carter reinvented the post-presidency, manifesting its possibilities and potential and providing a playbook, and a daunting standard, for activist former presidents.",
    "story": [
      "Along the way, Carter reinvented the post-presidency.",
      "What ended up as the most consequential post-presidency in U.S. history began just as inauspiciously.",
      "Jimmy Carter had lost his 1980 bid for reelection by ten percentage points, pulling just 41% of the popular vote versus 51% by his Republican challenger, Ronald Reagan. Shortly afterward, he discovered that the prosperous agricultural business he had built earlier in his career had been driven into the ground by a blind trust, leaving him millions in debt, adding to the $1.4 million of debt he had accrued as part of his failed reelection campaign, with no cash reserves to pay it off.",
      "Then there was the unresolved matter of the Iranian Hostage Crisis, which had crippled Carter's presidency, leading critics to charge him with being weak and ineffectual. When Reagan succeeded him as president on Jan. 20, 1981, Carter had been awake for over two full days as he oversaw the negotiation to release the 52 American hostages that had been detained by the Iranian government for 444 days. A last thumb in Carter's eye: They would be freed in the first minutes of Reagan's presidency.",
      "Upon relinquishing the White House, Carter returned briefly to his native Plains, Georgia, which at the time boasted a population of just 640 residents, where he was welcomed home in a driving rain by friends and neighbors with a covered-dish supper. The rain-soaked homecoming didn't last for long. Just hours afterward, Carter flew off to Wiesbaden, Germany, to greet the freed hostages, only to be met with anger by many of them who believed he had failed to ensure their liberation earlier.",
      "On Jan. 22, 1980, Carter returned to Plains, to the ranch-style home he and wife Rosalynn had built in 1961, but hadn't lived in for ten years. Exhausted and depleted, the now former president slept for 24 hours before awakening to what he described as \"an altogether unwanted life\" \u2013 and with no idea what he would do next.",
      "Twenty-one years later, Carter would be awakened by an early-morning phone call in that same home, in that same small town, with the news that he had won the Nobel Peace Prize for, as the Nobel committee wrote, \"his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.\"",
      "Along the way, Carter reinvented the post-presidency, manifesting its possibilities and potential and providing a playbook, and a daunting standard, for activist former presidents. He showed how a president can leverage the stature of being a \"former\" to advance a philanthropic agenda, while enhancing his overall legacy and strengthening the American brand.",
      "The improbable journey from newly defeated one-term president to Nobel laureate reflected a pattern throughout Carter's fruitful life, one spent achieving outsize ambitions by defying long odds. Carter launched his career in politics in 1962 by challenging the political machine in Southwestern Georgia, successfully contesting a rigged election and winning a seat in the Georgia state legislature. While he lost a race for Georgia governor four years later, he came back to win the office in 1970, becoming one of a crop of new leaders to usher in a new, post-segregation South.",
      "After leaving the governor's mansion in 1975 due to a state law then prohibiting governors from serving consecutive terms, Carter set his sights on the distant presidency, a dark-horse former governor of a deep Southern state with little or no name recognition \u2013 so much so that even his home state\u2019s Atlanta Constitution newspaper ran a story headlined, \u201cJimmy Who Is Running for What?\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody thought I had a chance in God\u2019s world to be the nominee,\u201d Carter told me in 2013.",
      "His unlikely nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate and subsequent victory over incumbent President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election spoke to Carter's relentless drive and preternatural self-assuredness.",
      "Those same qualities would come to bear in his post-White House endeavors. Just a little more than a year out of office, as he considered his future, Carter had an epiphany: that he could create a nongovernmental, non-profit organization that could focus on intractable problems around the world which the international community and the United Nations were not addressing. The Carter Center, attached to his presidential library in Atlanta, did just that, becoming an outlet for the former president's activism and vision for a better world.",
      "Since its launch in 1982, the Carter Center, scrupulously overseen by Carter himself, has monitored over a hundred elections in 39 countries and has helped to peacefully resolve disputes throughout the world \u2013 including in Haiti, Sudan, and Bosnia \u2013 while working toward the eradication of Guinea worm disease and river blindness, insidious ailments that went largely unchecked among the world's poor and developing nations. Recognizing his skill in conflict resolution, President Bill Clinton tapped the ex-president in the 1990s to represent the U.S. in a negotiation to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program, and in staving off a U.S. military invasion of Haiti.",
      "As prodigious as they were, Carter's activities weren't limited to the Carter Center. Soon into his post-presidency, Carter took up a hammer for Habitat for Humanity, providing both labor and inspiration for the next four-and-a-half decades on work projects that bear his name. Somehow, he also found time to teach Sunday school nearly every week at Plains' Maranatha Baptist Church \u2013 and pose afterward for photographs with visitors to the congregation \u2013 as well as do woodwork, fly fish, paint, and become our most prolific presidential author.",
      "Carter sometimes bristled when he was called \"our best ex-president,\" a backhanded compliment that disregarded a presidential term that he saw as largely successful. \"I don't know of any decisions I made in the White House that were basically erroneous,\" he told me in 2005.",
      "But he didn't spend a great deal of time worrying about his place in the presidential pantheon. The things Jimmy Carter wanted to be remembered for went beyond any achievement he may have chalked up in the White House.",
      "In 2014, in an interview at the LBJ Library, I asked Carter how he wanted to be remembered.",
      "\"I think lot of people will say 'He only served one term and got defeated [for reelection],'\" he replied. \"I would like for people to remember that I kept the peace and that I promoted human rights \u2026That would be my preference.\"",
      "He will get his wish.",
      "Mark K. Updegrove is a presidential historian and ABC News political contributor. He is the president and CEO of the LBJ Foundation, and the author of \"Second Acts: Presidential Lives and Legacies After the White House.\"",

      "It did not specify an inability to find a blade manufacturer as the reason for needing a second delay, but its most recent request said, \u201cThe offshore wind equipment market continues to experience significant price volatility and the company has not yet identified a solution to that volatility.\u201d",

      "A Pennsylvania court says the secretary of state has the authority to direct counties not to allow \u201cunauthorized third party access\u201d to voting machines or risk having those machines decertified and unable to be deployed for elections",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania court on Tuesday ruled 6-1 that the secretary of state has the authority to direct counties not to allow \u201cunauthorized third party access\u201d to voting machines or risk having those machines decertified and unable to be deployed for elections.",
      "The Commonwealth Court said the Department of State does not have to reimburse counties when they decertify machines, a defeat for Fulton County in a dispute that arose after two Republican county commissioners permitted Wake Technology Services Inc. to examine and obtain data from Dominion voting machines in 2021.",
      "That led the state elections agency to issue a directive against such third-party access based on concerns it could compromise security. Fulton's machines were decertified as a result of the Wake TSI examination and the secretary of state was sued by the county as well as Republican county commissioners Randy Bunch and Stuart Ulsh.",
      "Fulton had argued it had broad authority over the voting machines, while the secretary of state said that \u201cwould mean that every county board of elections can do whatever it wants\u201d with electronic voting systems under their authority to inspect elections, \u201can absurd and unreasonable result,\u201d wrote Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer for the majority.",
      "She said a 1937 state election law gave county election boards broad power, but state lawmakers amended it \u201cto give the secretary an important role in ensuring statewide consistency and safety\u201d regarding electronic voting systems. The state and local power balance over elections and voting equipment, the majority said, helps \u201cprotect and provide for free and fair and secure elections.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no conflict between those provisions, and it is entirely possible \u2014 indeed necessary \u2014 for county boards of elections to fulfill their powers and duties while heeding the secretary\u2019s report and directives,\u201d Jubelirer wrote for the majority.",
      "The Department of State issued a statement saying it was pleased with the decision and that the adminstration of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro \u201cis committed to ensuring the free and secure administration of elections, and today\u2019s decision recognizes that the secretary is empowered to keep voting systems secure from unauthorized third-parties seeking to undermine confidence in Pennsylvania\u2019s elections.\u201d",
      "The Fulton County board, through chief clerk Stacey Shives, declined comment about the decision. Messages seeking comment were left Tuesday for Fulton County's lawyers, Tom Carroll and Jim Stein.",
      "The officials in Fulton, a 15,000 population county in rural central Pennsylvania, brought in Wake TSI and allowed another outside inspection as part of an effort to find the sort of election fraud that then-President Donald Trump falsely claimed existed after his 2020 reelection loss. Fulton heavily supported Trump in all three of his presidential campaigns. Ulsh is no longer an elected county commissioner.",
      "Fulton replaced the voting machines, which were impounded by the court during the dispute over allowing others to access them.",

      "At the intersection of health and edginess, traditionalism and hipsterism, global culture and the American stomach, the pickle in 2024 found itself caught in a mealstrom of words like \u201cviral\u201d and \u201ctrending\u201d just as its food-as-fetish-object cousins \u2014 bacon and ranch dressing, notably \u2014 experienced in years past. Prepared Foods, an industry newsletter, said it outright in September: \u201cThe pickle obsession is at an all-time high.\u201d",
      "Tangy Pickle Doritos. Grill Mates Dill Pickle Seasoning for your steak. Portable pouches of pickles. Pickle mayonnaise, pickle hummus, pickle cookies, pickle gummies. Spicy pickle challenges. Pickleback shots at the bar. Pickle juice and Dr. Pepper, heaven help us. Corn puffs colored and flavored like pickles and called, naturally, Pickle Balls. In Pittsburgh, the cradle of the modern American pickle (talkin\u2019 to you, H.J. Heinz), a summer festival called Picklesburgh that draws aficionados of the sour and the puckery from several states away for copious amounts of pickle beer washed down by brine, or vice versa.",
      "As 2025 begins, two possible conclusions present themselves. First: The previously nobrow pickle has embedded its sour self at the nucleus of the American gastro-zeitgeist for the foreseeable future. Second: This maybe has played itself out, and the pickle has (to mix a metaphor) jumped the shark.",
      "But let's not get ahead of ourselves.",
      "\u201cI think pickling in general has had a resurgence,\u201d says Emily Ruby, who would know. She is a curator and expert on the history of the Heinz company for the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh, a couple miles downriver from this industrial borough where Henry J. Heinz churned out his first packaged pickles in the 19th century. Indeed, pickles are now a $3.1 billion annual market in the United States and growing consistently.",
      "Let\u2019s dispense with the obvious hanging question. In short: Sour nation, sour mood, sour foods? Maybe just a little.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a scary few years for a lot of people. In 2024 we needed something we could agree on. Maybe it\u2019s pickles,\u201d says Alex Plakias, an associate professor at Hamilton College in New York who teaches the philosophy of food.",
      "\u201cI was surprised at how the pickle could be all things to all people,\u201d says Plakias, whose most recent book is about awkwardness. \u201cAll these different food identities in 2024, and no matter who you think of, pickles can be for them.\u201d",
      "To see how that might have happened, we can look to the potent pathways of marketing and social media.",
      "The garden-variety American cucumber pickle is crunchy and sour, with an aggressive taste of its own but a clear elasticity that accommodates other \u201cflavor profiles\u201d (Ghost pepper pickles! Garlic pickles! Horseradish pickles! Bread and butter chips!). They\u2019re also absurdly low fat \u2014 the rare food trend that\u2019s not outright bad for you \u2014 and some offer the probiotic benefits of fermentation. Key marketing points all.",
      "From a positioning perspective, somehow the pickle exists at the crossroads of homey-slash-traditional (Mom, Lower East Side, preserves, harvests) and edgy-slash-slightly subversive (sour, intense flavors, startup pickle factories in reclaimed industrial neighborhoods).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like I come from a long line of picklers. But I realized that a cucumber is a blank slate and you get to paint it with all kinds of different brines and spices and salts and sugars,\u201d says John Patterson, who founded Pittsburgh Pickle with his brothers out of a church kitchen a decade ago.",
      "\u201cA pickle is something you can rely on and count on,\u201d he says. \u201cA pickle is always funny, for some reason. A pickle is never nefarious or mean. It\u2019s a peaceful, wholesome business to be in.\u201d",
      "(Of the cucumber itself, he has this to say: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like God intended them to be pickled.\u201d)",
      "The pickle is also, let\u2019s be candid, usually green and bumpy and intrinsically unattractive. That means even social-video newbies don\u2019t need precision lighting to crank out reasonably compelling pickle content.",
      "Credit \u2014 or blame \u2014 TikTok for some of the frenzy. Watching the meticulous chronicling of pickle-cake baking, pickle-wreath making and pickle-pizza crafting, you get the sense the social platform was made as much for dills as for dancing. Pickle videos there regularly top 2 million viewers, and as of this week TikTok reported more than 251 million pieces of pickle content for the snacking.",
      "Then there is the Great Glickle Surge of 2024 \u2014 another social media oddity that involves someone pouring \u201cedible glitter\u201d (who knew?) into a jar of pickles and making \u201cglickles\u201d \u2014 ostensibly a sexier, blingier, even Instagrammier version of pickles (again, who knew?).",
      "Finally, COVID likely played a pivotal role. After years of rising locavore ethos, the pandemic\u2019s forced inward focus in 2020 and 2021 led many Americans to revisit DIY approaches to food, including baking sourdough bread and, yes, pickling things. It\u2019s what Nora Rubel, who researches food and culture, calls \u201can embrace of \u2018grandmothercore\u2019 culture\u201d by, well, grandchildren. \u201cGen Z is taking pickles as their thing. This is the new avocado toast,\u201d says Rubel, a professor of Jewish studies at the University of Rochester.",
      "\u201cPickles are also kind of funny. They\u2019re just sort of goofy. You can make a lot of puns about pickles. It\u2019s intense flavor, but there\u2019s also a kind of silliness about them,\u201d Rubel says. (She also was heard to say: \u201cThe sweet pickle is something that\u2019s very deceptive and upsetting to me.\u201d)",
      "If you\u2019re seeing a thread emerging, it\u2019s this \u2014 not entirely new, but worth repeating: Packaged food is no longer positioned as merely something to eat. Instead, like the most immersive restaurants, these days it often presents itself as a multimedia experience \u2014 something to be talked about and reveled in, to join likeminded communities over, to incorporate into your own personality. Lifestyle pickles, as it were.",
      "\u201cIt symbolizes how we engage with food in daily life and with each other in 2024,\u201d says MinJi (MJ) Kim, an assistant professor of communication at Flagler College in Florida who studies how media affects people\u2019s food choices.",
      "\u201cSour has duality. When milk or meat or vegetables develop a sour smell, it signals spoilage. It\u2019s a natural warning system. We equate sourness with risk,\u201d Kim says. \u201cOn the other hand, when sourness is intentional \u2014 lemons, cider vinegar, greek yogurt \u2014 it becomes a marker of health and appeal. It shifts the perception of sourness from risk to something acceptable.\u201d",
      "There you have it: sourness as acceptable, delicious, even worthy of obsession.",
      "So as the popularity of pickleball \u2014 no direct relation \u2014 continues to spike, as fried pickles transcend their novelty status and become bar-food stalwarts across the land, and as someone's pet plays with one of 26 pickle holiday toys, we\u2019ll leave you with two dueling thoughts as America crunches its way into a new year.",
      "From Rubel, this: \u201cYou can get pickle everything now. This is really my time.\u201d",
      "And from Delish, the food website, this: \"Can we give pickles a break in 2025? They\u2019re tired. And we\u2019re tired for them.\u201d",

      "Both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq announced this week that they plan to close their equity and options markets next Thursday in observance of a National Day of Mourning for the 39th U.S. president and global humanitarian. Carter died on Sunday at his home in Plains, Georgia. He was 100 years old.",
      "The Nasdaq also observed a moment of silence early Monday in remembrance Carter. And the NYSE says it will fly its U.S. flag at half-staff throughout the mourning period of the late president.",
      "Tal Cohen, Nasdaq president, said in a statement that the exchange would be closing its markets Jan. 9 \u201cto celebrate (Carter's) life and honor his legacy.\" He added that Carter \u201cwas an exemplary leader, one who tirelessly continued his efforts to improve the human condition even after his tenure in public office was complete.\"",
      "In a separate announcement, NYSE Group president Lynn Martin also pointed to Carter's \u201cenduring legacy of humanitarianism\u201d and said the exchange planned to honor his lifetime of service.",
      "President Joe Biden declared Jan. 9 as a National Day of Mourning shortly after Carter\u2019s death on Sunday, which is customary following the passing of an American president. Wall Street also has a tradition of paying homage to the nation's late leaders and closed their doors on these designated days.",
      "Surviving records from the NYSE indicate that the first time the centuries-old exchange closed to honor a deceased president was likely April 15, 1865 \u2014 following the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the NYSE confirmed to The Associated Press Tuesday, and it remained closed until April 21, 1865. Trading was again suspended once on April 24th and 25th of that year, when Lincoln\u2019s funeral procession reached New York.",
      "In the years that followed, the NYSE also closed to honor other U.S. presidents including, but not limited to, the national days of mourning for President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, President John F. Kennedy in 1963, President Richard Nixon in 1994 and President Ronald Reagan in 2004.",
      "The last time both the NYSE and Nasdaq, which was formed in 1971, closed trading due to the death of a U.S. president was Dec. 5, 2018, honoring the late President George H.W. Bush.",
      "While closures are rare on non-holidays, the NYSE and the Nasdaq have also suspended trading for the deaths of other notable figures and national tragedies over the years. According to CNBC and Bloomberg, the NYSE closed following the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. And both the NYSE and Nasdaq canceled trading following the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, remaining closed until Sept. 17, 2001."

      "The decision puts back on track the agreements that would have the three men plead guilty to one of the deadliest attacks ever on the United States in exchange for being spared the possibility of the death penalty. The attacks by al-Qaida killed nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001, and helped spur U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq in what the George W. Bush administration called its war on terror.",

    "story": [
      "The use of mail ballots exploded in 2020 as states looked for ways to accommodate voters during the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "HONOLULU -- As with many voters on Maui, Joshua Kamalo thought the race for president wasn't the only big contest on the November ballot. He also was focused on a hotly contested seat for the local governing board.",
      "He made sure to return his ballot in the virtually all vote-by-mail state early, doing so two weeks before Election Day. A week later, he received a letter telling him the county couldn\u2019t verify his signature on the return envelope, jeopardizing his vote.",
      "And he wasn't the only one. Two other people at the biodiesel company where he works also had their ballots rejected, as did his daughter. In each case, the county said their signatures didn't match the ones on file.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how they fix that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right,\u201d said Kamalo, a truck driver who persevered through traffic congestion and limited parking options to get to the county office so he could sign an affidavit affirming that the signature was indeed his.",
      "He said he probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered to fix it if the South Maui county council race wasn\u2019t so close. The co-founder of his employer, Pacific Biodiesel, was the candidate who ended up on the losing side.",
      "Kamalo's experience is part of a broader problem as mail voting rises in popularity and more states opt to send ballots to all voters. Matching signatures on returned mail ballot envelopes to the official ones recorded at local voting offices can be a tedious process, sometimes done by humans and sometimes through automation, and can lead to dozens, hundreds or even thousands of ballots being rejected.",
      "If the voter can't correct it in time, the ballot won't count.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a big push toward mail voting over the last few years, and I think the tradeoffs aren\u2019t always clear to voters,\u201d said Larry Norden, an elections and government expert at the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "He said it's important for states and local governments to have procedures that ensure large numbers of eligible mail ballot voters aren't being disenfranchised.",
      "The use of mail ballots exploded in 2020 as states looked for ways to accommodate voters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight states and the District of Columbia now have universal mail voting, in which all active registered voters are mailed a ballot unless they opt out.",
      "At least 30 states require election officials to notify voters if there is a problem with their mail ballot and give them a chance to fix \u2014 or \u201ccure\u201d \u2014 it. Some have complained that the timeframe allowed to do that is too short.",
      "Nevada, a key presidential battleground, is among the states that mails a ballot to all registered voters. In November, county election offices rejected about 9,000 mail ballots primarily because of signature problems.",
      "That didn't affect the outcome of the state's presidential race, which Donald Trump won by 46,000 votes, but it could have changed the outcome in some down ballot races. Some state legislative seats in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and had more than half of the rejected mail ballots, were decided by just several hundred votes. The North Las Vegas City Council race, also in Clark County, was decided by just nine votes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had signature curing problems since we adopted universal mail-in voting during the pandemic in 2020, and it seems to be getting worse,\u201d said Sondra Cosgrove, history professor at the College of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas and executive director of Vote Nevada, a civic organization. \"This is something that\u2019s a crisis level that needs to get fixed.\u201d",
      "The potential for signature match problems to affect closes races has led some voting rights groups in the the state to call for an overhaul of the verification process.",
      "\u201cWe have to find the best option going forward for people that is more accessible, that gets their votes and ballots counted on time, because it\u2019s crazy when you think about the difference-maker being eight or nine votes,\u201d said Christian Solomon, the state director of Rise Nevada, a youth-led civic engagement group.",
      "Nevada voters already took one step toward a potential fix in November when they approved \u2014 by 73% \u2014 a constitutional amendment that will require voters to present identification to vote. When voting with a mailed ballot, a driver's license or Social Security number will be required in addition to the signature. Voters will need to approve the amendment a second time in two years for it to take effect.",
      "Dave Gibbs, president of the Repair the Vote PAC, which wrote the amendment, said he was inspired by a a law passed in 2021 in another presidential swing state, Georgia.",
      "That state ended its signature check process and instead now requires voters to submit their driver's license number or state identification card number when returning a mailed ballot, said Mike Hassinger, spokesman for the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office. Most voting there is done early but in-person.",
      "Critics say such ID requirements would be too burdensome for states, like Hawaii, where mailed ballots account for the vast majority of voting.",
      "On Maui, the number of rejected mail ballots prompted a lawsuit challenging the results of the local county council election, where the winning margin was just 97 votes.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that hundreds of ballots weren\u2019t counted because the county clerk wrongly claimed they arrived in envelopes with signatures that didn\u2019t match the one on file. Attorney Lance Collins said his clients wanted a new election in the race between Tom Cook and his client, Kelly King.",
      "Six voters submitted declarations saying they were told their ballot envelope signature was deficient when, in their view, there was nothing wrong with it.",
      "Collins said under the state\u2019s administrative rules, a returned ballot envelope is presumed to be that of the voter and should be counted unless there is evidence to suggest it\u2019s not the voter\u2019s. He also said the county's rejection rate was significantly higher than the national average.",
      "Maui County\u2019s attorneys responded in a court filing that its signature verification process followed the law. On Dec. 24, the state Supreme Court unanimously agreed and declared Cook the winner. The justices said the clerk provided voters with reasonable notice and opportunity to correct the deficiency on their ballot envelopes.",
      "Even so, many voters on Maui have shared similar stories about being informed their signatures didn't match. Resident Grace Min, who was not part of the lawsuit, was among those who received one of the letters.",
      "\u201cI just find it highly unusual that my (ballot) signature would not have matched my signature,\u201d she said.",
      "She had been paying particular attention to the county government race that she knew would be close, so it was important for her to make sure her vote was counted. She emailed an affidavit confirming the ballot was hers, but also had questions about the verification process and was concerned the time allowed for curing ballots was so short.",
      "\u201cI just have to imagine there had to have been people who didn\u2019t fix their signature,\" Min said, \u201cand that doesn\u2019t seem very fair.\u201d",

      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Amid everything else on his desk \u2014 the Iran hostage crisis, domestic economic turmoil, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and a grueling 1980 reelection fight \u2014 President Jimmy Carter elevated the independence of a country in southern Africa as a top agenda item.",
      "Carter hosted then-Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe at the White House soon after his country achieved independence and later described Zimbabwe's adoption of democracy as \u201cour greatest single success.\u201d",
      "Three decades later, Carter, who was long out of office, found the door slammed shut when he and other dignitaries sought to visit Zimbabwe on a humanitarian mission to observe reported human rights abuses after a violent disputed election in 2008. He had become a critic of Mugabe\u2019s regime and was denied a visa.",
      "Carter didn\u2019t give up. From neighboring South Africa, he relied on emissaries from Zimbabwe for testimony on violence and allegations of electoral fraud. The effort reflected the former president's long commitment to promoting democracy worldwide.",
      "This \u201cmore than anything else cemented Carter\u2019s legacy\u201d as an advocate for free and fair elections across Africa, said Eldred Masunungure, a former political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe.",
      "\u201cCarter didn\u2019t change. Zimbabwe did. Mugabe swayed from the democratic ideals that Carter held so dear,\u201d he said. \u201cThe incident demonstrates Carter\u2019s consistency, the steadfastness.\u201d",
      "Zimbabwe\u2019s evolution toward autocracy turned out to be the kind of scenario that the Carter Center has long sought to prevent by deploying observers and developing voting standards in countries struggling to form democracies.",
      "Established in 1982, two years after Carter lost his bid for a second term, the center has been Carter's signature effort to promote fair elections as a vehicle for peace. It has sent observers to monitor some 125 elections in 40 countries and three tribal nations, and has been credited with helping expand democracy across the globe.",
      "Carter\u2019s \u201cmoral authority, the trust people put in him and the credibility of someone who had both won and lost an election\u201d contributed to these successes, David Carroll, head of the center\u2019s democracy program, told The Associated Press.",
      "Carter, who died Sunday at 100, was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for the center\u2019s work supporting elections, promoting human rights and helping developing countries cultivate economic, social and public health institutions.",
      "Its elections work began in Panama, where Carter became concerned about the 1989 elections after reports of armed militia members in civilian clothes confiscating voting records during the night.",
      "The Carter Center had just decided to expand its mission of conflict resolution and human rights to include vote monitoring, concluding that democratic elections were essential to resolving political disputes.",
      "\u201cIn my fumbling Spanish, I stood up on a table, and I denounced the election as fraudulent,\u201d Carter recalled in a 2015 video marking the center\u2019s 100th election observer mission. \u201cThere was later another election, which was honest and fair, and that was the birth of real democracy in Panama.\u201d",
      "The center also helped rescue a peace process in Nepal, then oversaw the country\u2019s twice-postponed elections in 2008 to elect an assembly that would be tasked with writing a constitution. Carter made several trips to the South Asian nation, holding marathon negotiations with former rebels and top politicians to keep the peace process on track.",
      "\u201cThere was deadlock in the country. Political parties were not sitting together, and there was no way out on how the process will move on,\u201d said Bhojraj Pokharel, Nepal\u2019s chief election commissioner in 2008, who later worked with Carter in Congo and Myanmar.",
      "On Nepal's election day, Carter traveled to dozens of polling stations talking to voters. Polling was peaceful despite earlier fears of violence.",
      "\u201cHis presence itself was a message to the Nepalese population and voters about the integrity of the election,\u201d Pokharel said.",
      "The Carter Center often works in countries with little or no experience in representative government and where trust has all but evaporated because of violence.",
      "After Bolivia held elections in 2019 that the Organization of American States said were marred by fraud, the country\u2019s electoral tribunal invited the Carter Center to observe elections the following year. The center deployed a team to Bolivia and later commended the country for elections it called impartial and transparent.",
      "The Carter Center\u2019s \u201cevaluation was important not only for how the international community viewed us but also for how Bolivian society evaluated the electoral process,\u201d said Salvador Romero, the tribunal\u2019s president at the time.",
      "Similar results have been difficult to obtain recently in Africa, where many countries emerging from decades of colonialism have seen forceful takeovers and disputed elections.",
      "In Nigeria, Tunisia, Zambia and Ivory Coast, Carter Center observers noted violence, killings, vote-buying, uneven playing fields for political parties and candidates, and a general lack of trust in elections.",
      "In Tunisia, frustration has replaced the wave of hope brought by the 2010 Arab Spring uprising. A new parliament was convened in March 2023, two years after President Kais Saied suspended parliament and started legislating by decree. The 11% turnout for parliamentary elections marked \u201ca low point\u201d for the country's democracy, The Carter Center said, and some election observer groups were denied accreditation for the October 2024 presidential contest.",
      "At times, Carter personally intervened to keep African peace processes on track by trying to persuade warlords and rebels to support elections, rather than the use of force, in their quests for power.",
      "In recent years, the Carter Center\u2019s elections work turned toward the U.S.",
      "Its teams deployed to Oklahoma in 2017 at the request of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes following elections plagued with problems. In 2013, ballots had been moved from office to office and stored without proper security, eroding confidence in the integrity of the vote. A recount then overturned the results, tribal Gov. Reggie Wassana said.",
      "The Carter Center\u2019s presence in the later election made \u201ca huge difference, and it restored some faith among tribal members,\u201d Wassana said.",
      "Until 2020, the center tried to stay away from broader political issues in the United States, according to Carroll. But the center noticed threats to American democracy were increasing, which prompted a decision to expand programs within the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf we saw the same conditions in another country that we were seeing in the U.S. \u2014 the lack of trust in election institutions, polarization and growing concern of political violence \u2014 it is exactly the kind of country we would prioritize to see if we could play a constructive role,\u201d Carroll said.",
      "Faith in U.S. elections, most notably among a large segment of Republican voters, eroded after the 2020 election amid former President Donald Trump's false claims that Democrats had rigged the vote. There was no evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation of voting machines in that election.",
      "In the 2024 presidential election, which Trump won, the center did some limited observation in New Mexico, Montana and Fulton County, Georgia. In many U.S. states, election observers are limited to political party representatives, with no provisions for nonpartisan, independent groups. The center is working to change that.",
      "Carter's leadership on democracy issues remains a north star for the center, Carroll said.",
      "\u201cYou can help strong systems be in place, but they need to be watched continually. You can never rest on your record on democracy and elections. You always have to be vigilant and keep an eye on the process,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "In a deeply partisan Congress, one group of lawmakers with a shared background is working in a bipartisan way to try to pass important legislation",
      "WASHINGTON -- The players in this year's Army-Navy football game kept up a long tradition, with each side honoring the other\u2019s school song when the contest ended. It was an acknowledgment that the future could bring moments when the opponents that day are teammates on deadlier fields.",
      "That ethos also guides a group in the U.S. House that calls itself the For Country Caucus. Its members are veterans with wide military experience who have banded together across party and ideological lines. At a time when bipartisan working relationships in Congress seem rare, with little hope for change in the coming session, the caucus shows there are still spaces where people with different views come together.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to lead by example, both within Congress to show our colleagues that this is possible, but also to America more broadly,\u201d said Colorado Democrat Jason Crow, who is one of the outgoing co-chairs of the caucus.",
      "\u201cPeople only get deluged with the crazy aspects of Congress and the things that don\u2019t work and the people yelling and screaming,\" Crow said. \"We just don\u2019t get as much attention when we\u2019re actually working together.\u201d",
      "The caucus began in 2019 to bridge the divides that plague Washington and slow its effectiveness, said Steve Womack, a Republican member of the caucus from Arkansas and a retired colonel in the Army National Guard.",
      "Bringing together people who see themselves as sharing a commitment to putting country and mission first seemed like a starting point \u201cto maybe advance some agendas that would be good for the country,'' Womack said. Deadlines, comfort with high-pressure situations and a focus on common goals create \u201ca kind of warrior ethos,\u201d he said.",
      "Since then, the group has been integral in getting more than 100 bills passed into law. The legislation includes such areas as national security, strengthening the military, veterans' issues, national service and supporting military families, especially those that have lost loved ones.",
      "The caucus was instrumental in getting an increase \u2014 the first in two decades \u2014 in payments designed to help military families bear the added financial costs of deployments. The caucus also pushed a provision to allow federal agencies to appoint military spouses to remote work positions, an action that could allow them to keep their jobs despite multiple moves.",
      "Other legislation signed recently included an act to help continue efforts to evacuate Afghans who served alongside U.S. military members, diplomats and aid workers in Afghanistan.",
      "One of the group's first successes was the effort to establish the Global War on Terrorism Memorial on the National Mall. Its design is underway.",
      "\u201cWe are a small but mighty caucus that punches way above its weight,\u201d Crow said.",
      "Members of it sit on a number of committees together and meet regularly, including breakfast briefings twice a month. Recently, those briefings have included the heads of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Space Force, as well as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "Other guests have spoken about national service, such as the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps and Voices for National Service.",
      "\u201cWe believe really strongly that one of the ways to bring Americans together is to get Americans to work together again,\u201d Crow said.",
      "That doesn't have to be in the military, he said. People also can find common ground by serving their communities.",
      "Their staff members also meet, and the representatives have some functions off Capitol Hill, including washing the black granite walls at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.",
      "Two members of the outgoing group are retiring, while the 28 others were reelected. The caucus expects to pick up at least five new members in the next Congress, meaning nearly 8% of the House will be part of the caucus.",
      "Crow, a former Army Ranger who served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his co-chair, Texas Republican Tony Gonzales, a retired Navy chief petty officer, will hand over the leadership to Texas Republican Jake Ellzey, a former F/A-18 pilot, and Air Force Academy alumnus Don Davis, a North Carolina Democrat.",
      "Edward Crawford, a co-founder of War Veterans Fund, which recruits Republican war veterans to run for Congress, has had several candidates join the caucus after winning their races.",
      "\u201cIn a polarized world and a very polarized country, we veterans have to work with everybody,\" he said. \"You go into combat, Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re getting shot at. You\u2019re working together. You\u2019re covering each other. Democrat or Republican, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "A Navy veteran himself, Crawford said that while his organization centers on Republican prospects, he refers Democrats to his counterpart at a group called With Honor Action, because that nonpartisan organization promotes veterans from both parties for elective office.",
      "\u201cWe want them to be successful, too,\" he said. \u201cWe want both sides of the aisle to get more veterans.\u201d",
      "Several of the members already had direct military connections.",
      "Reps. Pat Ryan, a New York Democrat, and John James, a Republican from Michigan, were West Point classmates who at one time lived on the same hall. Ryan is the first West Point graduate to represent the district where the academy is located.",
      "Ellzey flew in a squadron that provided air support in Afghanistan for Mike Waltz, a Florida Republican and caucus member, during one of Waltz's military deployments. A former Green Beret, Waltz has been tapped to become President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser.",
      "Crow and Womack, who were interviewed together, said they have been monitoring the debate over Pete Hegseth, Trump's nominee to lead the Defense Department, as well as issues related to the nomination such as veterans' benefits and women in combat.",
      "Womack said the nomination is the Senate's responsibility, but if issues that are counter to the ideals of the caucus are floated, \u201cthe whole For Country Caucus will be ready to spring into action. I think to the person, we all kind of know where each other is on those kinds of subjects.\"",
      "But, he added, \u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit premature right now to get too caught up in the conjecture of what may or may not happen in the new Congress.\u201d",
      "Crow said questions about women in combat are non-issues.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to take a position because it\u2019s just the fact that women serve in combat,\" he said. \"There are people in the caucus that have had that experience. So for us, this is not even a question.\u201d",
      "He said the caucus was made up of men and women of different backgrounds, nationalities, races and political positions. The outgoing co-vice chairs are New Jersey Democrat Mike Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot, and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, an Iowa Republican and Army and Army Reserves veteran whose career includes stints as a nurse and physician.",
      "Pushing specific ideologies is not part of its purpose, Crow said. Finding common ground, even in disagreements, is.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to take an all-or-nothing mentality because we know that when people take an all-or-nothing mentality, Americans end up with nothing,\u201d he said. \"That\u2019s just not acceptable to us.\u201d"

      "Value was in vogue in 2024.",
      "Shoppers and restaurant patrons in the U.S. were choosy about where and how to spend their money as they wrestled with high housing and food prices.",
      "Well-heeled customers traded down to Walmart and Aldi. Diners opted for fast food or home cooking instead of sit-down restaurants. Department stores struggled as buyers shopped online or at cheaper chains like H&M.",
      "Residents also moved away from buying furniture or investing in expensive renovations, opting to refresh their homes with inexpensive items like frames and candles.",
      "Those shifts changed the buying and eating landscape in 2024. As of Dec. 20, Coresight Research tracked 48 retail bankruptcies in the U.S., compared with 25 during the same period a year ago. And at least 22 restaurant chains filed for bankruptcy this year, the highest number since 2020, according to BankruptcyData, a company that tracks filings.",
      "Here are some of the trends \u2013 and dead ends \u2013 that The Associated Press tracked in 2024:",
      "WALMART",
      "The nation\u2019s largest retailer typically shines during tough times as shoppers turn to the discounter for groceries, which account for 60% of Walmart's total business. And just like during the 2008 Great Recession, Walmart saw households with incomes of $100,000 or above making up more of its clientele. But this time around, company executives think they can keep those customers because they\u2019ve expanded online services and added more stylish clothes and mannequins.",
      "AMAZON",
      "Online juggernaut Amazon leaned into its reputation as a destination for deals to appeal to bargain-hungry buyers. In November it launched Amazon Haul, a new low-cost storefront featuring electronics, apparel and other products priced under $20. And the company said its Prime Day event in July resulted in record sales. But Amazon could face headwinds in the coming year with threatened tariffs on products from China and labor unrest in the U.S.",
      "FAST CASUAL CHAINS",
      "It was a good year for restaurant chains like Shake Shack that are a step up from fast food but still offer good value. Cava, which specializes in fresh Mediterranean food, said its revenue surged more than 33% in the first nine months of this year as it rapidly built new restaurants. Chipotle got some heat from value-conscious diners about smaller portions, but drew customers back after retraining workers to ensure \u201cconsistent and generous\u201d portions.",
      "JEANS SELLERS",
      "The wide-leg jeans silhouette \u2013 the \u201cit\u201d style that rapidly replaced boot-cut and skinny jeans \u2013 drove sales across many different retailers this year. Macy\u2019s, Abercrombie & Fitch, Levi Strauss, Gap and Stitch Fix were among those citing the trend as a big sales booster in recent months. Value-conscious buyers could snap them up at Walmart for $29. At the high end, Gucci had wide-leg versions for $1,200.",
      "MCDONALD\u2019S",
      "The year didn\u2019t begin well for McDonald\u2019s. The company\u2019s sales slumped as inflation-weary customers chose to eat at home instead of grabbing fast food. But a $5 meal deal introduced in June helped draw lower-income customers back into stores. McDonald\u2019s extended the deal through the end of this year and said more value is coming in 2025. The fast food giant is working to get customers back after a fall E. coli outbreak linked to raw onions in Quarter Pounder hamburgers sickened at least 104 people in 14 states.",
      "TARGET",
      "Target\u2019s cheap chic fashions and home decor have long been a big attraction, but the chain faced challenges in 2024. Unlike Walmart, Target is more reliant on discretionary items like clothing because less than a quarter of its sales come from food and beverages. It has always battled a perception of being more expensive, and analysts say its merchandise has lately been in disarray. Still, Target drew crowds on Black Friday with exclusive Taylor Swift products.",
      "STARBUCKS",
      "Starbucks had a tough year. Orders are getting increasingly complex, with thousands of ways to customize drinks. That\u2019s leading to long lines and incorrect pickup times on the mobile app. New offerings like olive oil-infused coffee didn\u2019t attract customers, who also grew tired of Starbucks\u2019 high prices. Starbucks hired a new CEO, Brian Niccol, in the fall to help turn things around. But labor strife, which led to strikes in December, could continue to hurt the company in 2025.",
      "LEGACY RESTAURANTS",
      "Several decades-old chains threw in the towel in 2024, succumbing to rising competition, changing dining patterns and big portfolios of outdated restaurants. Red Lobster, TGI Fridays and Buca di Beppo all filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and shuttered dozens of locations. A leaner Red Lobster later exited bankruptcy under new ownership, but it remains to be seen whether older chains can turn around years of declining sales.",
      "BIG TICKET ITEMS",
      "At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. consumers took advantage of low interest rates and stimulus benefits to remodel their homes and make other big purchases. But last year, they pulled back. That\u2019s been a challenge for retailers like Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, which noted lower sales of appliances, home theaters and gaming equipment. Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s also reported lower sales of big-ticket items, particularly discretionary kitchen and bathroom remodeling projects.",
      "DEPARTMENT STORES",
      "Department stores, particularly those catering to middle income shoppers, have struggled to hold onto customers as many turn to online shopping or to fast-fashion retailers. Among the worst performers: Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based Kohl\u2019s, which reported its 11th consecutive quarter of sales declines this year. Outgoing CEO Tom Kingsbury recently owned up to merchandising mistakes, including scaling back fine jewelry, popular store label brands and petite sizes. Customers will see those categories return in the coming year.",
      "Macy\u2019s said it would close 150 namesake stores over three years and open 15 higher-end Bloomingdale\u2019s. Upscale Nordstrom, on the other hand, had a better than expected fiscal year due largely to soaring sales at its off-price Nordstrom Rack stores."

      "The 39th and longest-lived U.S. president, James Earl Carter Jr., died Sunday at the age of 100",
      "PLAINS, Ga. -- Newly married and sworn as a Naval officer, Jimmy Carter left his tiny hometown in 1946 hoping to climb the ranks and see the world.",
      "Less than a decade later, the death of his father and namesake, a merchant farmer and local politician who went by \u201cMr. Earl,\u201d prompted the submariner and his wife, Rosalynn, to return to the rural life of Plains, Georgia, they thought they\u2019d escaped.",
      "The lieutenant never would be an admiral. Instead, he became commander in chief. Years after his presidency ended in humbling defeat, he would add a Nobel Peace Prize, awarded not for his White House accomplishments but \u201cfor his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.\u201d",
      "The life of James Earl Carter Jr., the 39th and longest-lived U.S. president, ended Sunday at the age of 100 where it began: Plains, the town of 600 that fueled his political rise, welcomed him after his fall and sustained him during 40 years of service that redefined what it means to be a former president.",
      "With the stubborn confidence of an engineer and an optimism rooted in his Baptist faith, Carter described his motivations in politics and beyond in the same way: an almost missionary zeal to solve problems and improve lives.",
      "Carter was raised amid racism, abject poverty and hard rural living \u2014 realities that shaped both his deliberate politics and emphasis on human rights.",
      "\u201cHe always felt a responsibility to help people,\u201d said Jill Stuckey, a longtime friend of Carter's in Plains. \u201cAnd when he couldn\u2019t make change wherever he was, he decided he had to go higher.\u201d",
      "Carter's path, a mix of happenstance and calculation, pitted moral imperatives against political pragmatism; and it defied typical labels of American politics, especially caricatures of one-term presidents as failures.",
      "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t judge presidents by how popular they are in their day. That's a very narrow way of assessing them,\" Carter biographer Jonathan Alter told the Associated Press. \u201cWe should judge them by how they changed the country and the world for the better. On that score, Jimmy Carter is not in the first rank of American presidents, but he stands up quite well.\u201d",
      "Later in life, Carter conceded that many Americans, even those too young to remember his tenure, judged him ineffective for failing to contain inflation or interest rates, end the energy crisis or quickly bring home American hostages in Iran. He gained admirers instead for his work at The Carter Center \u2014 advocating globally for public health, human rights and democracy since 1982 \u2014 and the decades he and Rosalynn wore hardhats and swung hammers with Habitat for Humanity.",
      "Yet the common view that he was better after the Oval Office than in it annoyed Carter, and his allies relished him living long enough to see historians reassess his presidency.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t quite fit in today\u2019s terms\u201d of a left-right, red-blue scoreboard, said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who visited the former president multiple times during his own White House bid.",
      "At various points in his political career, Carter labeled himself \u201cprogressive\u201d or \u201cconservative\u201d \u2014 sometimes both at once. His most ambitious health care bill failed \u2014 perhaps one of his biggest legislative disappointments \u2014 because it didn\u2019t go far enough to suit liberals. Republicans, especially after his 1980 defeat, cast him as a left-wing cartoon.",
      "It would be easiest to classify Carter as a centrist, Buttigieg said, \u201cbut there\u2019s also something radical about the depth of his commitment to looking after those who are left out of society and out of the economy.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Carter\u2019s legacy is stitched with complexities, contradictions and evolutions \u2014 personal and political.",
      "The self-styled peacemaker was a war-trained Naval Academy graduate who promised Democratic challenger Ted Kennedy that he\u2019d \u201ckick his ass.\u201d But he campaigned with a call to treat everyone with \u201crespect and compassion and with love.\u201d",
      "Carter vowed to restore America\u2019s virtue after the shame of Vietnam and Watergate, and his technocratic, good-government approach didn't suit Republicans who tagged government itself as the problem. It also sometimes put Carter at odds with fellow Democrats.",
      "The result still was a notable legislative record, with wins on the environment, education, and mental health care. He dramatically expanded federally protected lands, began deregulating air travel, railroads and trucking, and he put human rights at the center of U.S. foreign policy. As a fiscal hawk, Carter added a relative pittance to the national debt, unlike successors from both parties.",
      "Carter nonetheless struggled to make his achievements resonate with the electorate he charmed in 1976. Quoting Bob Dylan and grinning enthusiastically, he had promised voters he would \u201cnever tell a lie.\u201d Once in Washington, though, he led like a joyless engineer, insisting his ideas would become reality and he'd be rewarded politically if only he could convince enough people with facts and logic.",
      "This served him well at Camp David, where he brokered peace between Israel\u2019s Menachem Begin and Epypt\u2019s Anwar Sadat, an experience that later sparked the idea of The Carter Center in Atlanta. Carter's tenacity helped the center grow to a global force that monitored elections across five continents, enabled his freelance diplomacy and sent public health experts across the developing world. The center\u2019s wins were personal for Carter, who hoped to outlive the last Guinea worm parasite, and nearly did.",
      "As president, though, the approach fell short when he urged consumers beleaguered by energy costs to turn down their thermostats. Or when he tried to be the nation\u2019s cheerleader, beseeching Americans to overcome a collective \u201ccrisis of confidence.\u201d",
      "Republican Ronald Reagan exploited Carter's lecturing tone with a belittling quip in their lone 1980 debate. \u201cThere you go again,\u201d the former Hollywood actor said in response to a wonky answer from the sitting president. \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d outpaced Carter in all but six states.",
      "Carter later suggested he \u201ctried to do too much, too soon\u201d and mused that he was incompatible with Washington culture: media figures, lobbyists and Georgetown social elites who looked down on the Georgians and their inner circle as \u201ccountry come to town.\u201d",
      "Carter carefully navigated divides on race and class on his way to the Oval Office.",
      "Born Oct. 1, 1924, Carter was raised in the mostly Black community of Archery, just outside Plains, by a progressive mother and white supremacist father. Their home had no running water or electricity but the future president still grew up with the relative advantages of a locally prominent, land-owning family in a system of Jim Crow segregation.",
      "He wrote of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s towering presence and his family\u2019s Democratic Party roots, but his father soured on FDR, and Jimmy Carter never campaigned or governed as a New Deal liberal. He offered himself as a small-town peanut farmer with an understated style, carrying his own luggage, bunking with supporters during his first presidential campaign and always using his nickname.",
      "And he began his political career in a whites-only Democratic Party.",
      "As private citizens, he and Rosalynn supported integration as early as the 1950s and believed it inevitable. Carter refused to join the White Citizens Council in Plains and spoke out in his Baptist church against denying Black people access to worship services.",
      "\u201cThis is not my house; this is not your house,\u201d he said in a churchwide meeting, reminding fellow parishioners their sanctuary belonged to God.",
      "Yet as the appointed chairman of Sumter County schools he never pushed to desegregate, thinking it impractical after the Supreme Court\u2019s 1954 Brown v. Board decision. And while presidential candidate Carter would hail the 1965 Voting Rights Act, signed by fellow Democrat Lyndon Johnson when Carter was a state senator, there is no record of Carter publicly supporting it at the time.",
      "Carter overcame a ballot-stuffing opponent to win his legislative seat, then lost the 1966 governor's race to an arch-segregationist. He won four years later by avoiding explicit mentions of race and campaigning to the right of his rival, who he mocked as \u201cCufflinks Carl\u201d \u2014 the insult of an ascendant politician who never saw himself as part the establishment.",
      "Carter\u2019s rural and small-town coalition in 1970 would match any victorious Republican electoral map in 2024. Once elected, though, Carter shocked his white conservative supporters \u2014 and landed on the cover of Time magazine \u2014 by declaring that \u201cthe time for racial discrimination is over.\u201d",
      "Before making the jump to Washington, Carter befriended the family of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., whom he\u2019d never sought out as he eyed the governor\u2019s office. Carter lamented his foot-dragging on school integration as a \u201cmistake.\u201d But he also met, conspicuously, with Alabama's segregationist Gov. George Wallace to accept his primary rival's endorsement ahead of the 1976 Democratic convention.",
      "\u201cHe very shrewdly took advantage of his own Southerness,\u201d said Amber Roessner, a University of Tennessee professor and expert on Carter\u2019s campaigns.",
      "A coalition of Black voters and white moderate Democrats ultimately made Carter the last Democratic presidential nominee to sweep the Deep South. Then, just as he did in Georgia, he used his power in office to appoint more non-whites than all his predecessors had, combined.",
      "He once acknowledged \u201cthe secret shame\u201d of white Americans who didn\u2019t fight segregation. But he also told Alter that doing more would have sacrificed his political viability \u2013 and thus everything he accomplished in office and after.",
      "King's daughter, Bernice King, described Carter as wisely \u201cstrategic\u201d in winning higher offices to enact change. \u201cHe was a leader of conscience,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "Rosalynn Carter, who died on Nov. 19 at the age of 96, was identified by both husband and wife as the \u201cmore political\u201d of the pair; she sat in on Cabinet meetings and urged him to postpone certain priorities, like pressing the Senate to relinquish control of the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cLet that go until the second term,\u201d she would sometimes say.",
      "The president, recalled her former aide Kathy Cade, retorted that he was \u201cgoing to do what\u2019s right\u201d even if \u201cit might cut short the time I have.\u201d",
      "Rosalynn held firm, Cade said: \u201cShe\u2019d remind him you have to win to govern.\u201d",
      "Carter also was the first president to appoint multiple women as Cabinet officers. Yet by his own telling, his career sprouted from chauvinism in the Carters' early marriage: He did not consult Rosalynn when deciding to move back to Plains in 1953 or before launching his state Senate bid a decade later.",
      "Many years later, he called it \u201cinconceivable\u201d that he didn\u2019t confer with the woman he described as his \u201cfull partner,\u201d at home, in government and at The Carter Center.",
      "\u201cWe developed a partnership when we were working in the farm supply business, and it continued when Jimmy got involved in politics,\u201d Rosalynn Carter told AP in 2021.",
      "So deep was their trust that when Carter remained tethered to the White House in 1980 as 52 Americans were held hostage in Tehran, it was Rosalynn who campaigned on her husband\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cI just loved it,\u201d she said, despite the bitterness of defeat.",
      "Fair or not, the label of a disastrous presidency had leading Democrats keep their distance, at least publicly, for many years, but Carter managed to remain relevant, writing books and weighing in on societal challenges.",
      "He lamented widening wealth gaps and the influence of money in politics. He voted for democratic socialist Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton in 2016, and later declared that America had devolved from fully functioning democracy to \u201coligarchy.\u201d",
      "Yet looking ahead to 2020, with Sanders running again, Carter warned Democrats not to \u201cmove to a very liberal program,\u201d lest they help re-elect President Donald Trump. Carter scolded the Republican for his serial lies and threats to democracy, and chided the U.S. establishment for misunderstanding Trump\u2019s populist appeal.",
      "He delighted in yearly convocations with Emory University freshmen, often asking them to guess how much he\u2019d raised in his two general election campaigns. \u201cZero,\u201d he\u2019d gesture with a smile, explaining the public financing system candidates now avoid so they can raise billions. Carter still remained quite practical in partnering with wealthy corporations and foundations to advance Carter Center programs.",
      "Carter recognized that economic woes and the Iran crisis doomed his presidency, but offered no apologies for appointing Paul Volcker as the Federal Reserve chairman whose interest rate hikes would not curb inflation until Reagan's presidency. He was proud of getting all the hostages home without starting a shooting war, even though Tehran would not free them until Reagan's Inauguration Day.",
      "\u201cCarter didn\u2019t look at it\u201d as a failure, Alter emphasized. \u201cHe said, \u2018They came home safely.\u2019 And that\u2019s what he wanted.\u201d",
      "Well into their 90s, the Carters greeted visitors at Plains\u2019 Maranatha Baptist Church, where he taught Sunday School and where he will have his last funeral before being buried on family property alongside Rosalynn. Carter, who made the congregation\u2019s collection plates in his woodworking shop, still garnered headlines there, calling for women\u2019s rights within religious institutions, many of which, he said, \u201csubjugate\u201d women in church and society.",
      "Carter was not one to dwell on regrets. \u201cI am at peace with the accomplishments, regret the unrealized goals and utilize my former political position to enhance everything we do,\u201d he wrote around his 90th birthday.",
      "The politician who had supposedly hated Washington politics also enjoyed hosting Democratic presidential contenders as public pilgrimages to Plains became advantageous again. Carter sat with Buttigieg for the final time March 1, 2020, hours before the Indiana mayor ended his campaign and endorsed eventual winner Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cHe asked me how I thought the campaign was going,\u201d Buttigieg said, recalling that Carter flashed his signature grin and nodded along as the young candidate, born a year after Carter left office, \u201cput the best face\u201d on the walloping he endured the day before in South Carolina.",
      "Never breaking his smile, the 95-year-old host fired back, \u201cI think you ought to drop out.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo matter of fact,\u201d Buttigieg said with a laugh. \u201cIt was somehow encouraging.\u201d",
      "Carter had lived enough, won plenty and lost enough to take the long view.",
      "\u201cHe talked a lot about coming from nowhere,\u201d Buttigieg said, not just to attain the presidency but to leverage \u201call of the instruments you have in life\u201d and \u201cmake the world more peaceful.\u201d",
      "In his farewell address as president, Carter said as much to the country that had embraced and rejected him.",
      "\u201cThe struggle for human rights overrides all differences of color, nation or language,\u201d he declared. \u201cThose who hunger for freedom, who thirst for human dignity and who suffer for the sake of justice \u2014 they are the patriots of this cause.\u201d",
      "Carter pledged to remain engaged with and for them as he returned \u201chome to the South where I was born and raised,\u201d home to Plains, where that young lieutenant had indeed become \u201ca fellow citizen of the world.\u201d",
      "\u2014-",

      "NEW YORK -- Top-ranked chess player Magnus Carlsen is headed back to the World Blitz Championship on Monday after its governing body agreed to loosen a dress code that got him fined and denied a late-round game in another tournament for refusing to change out of jeans.",
      "Lamenting the contretemps, International Chess Federation President Arkady Dvorkovich said in a statement Sunday that he'd let World Blitz Championship tournament officials consider allowing \u201cappropriate jeans\u201d with a jacket, and other \u201celegant minor deviations\u201d from the dress code.",
      "He said Carlsen's stand \u2014 which culminated in his quitting the tournament Friday \u2014 highlighted a need for more discussion \u201cto ensure that our rules and their application reflect the evolving nature of chess as a global and accessible sport.\u201d",
      "Carlsen, meanwhile, said in a video posted Sunday on social media that he would play \u2014 and wear jeans \u2014 in the World Blitz Championship when it begins Monday.",
      "\u201cI think the situation was badly mishandled on their side,\u201d the 34-year-old Norwegian grandmaster said. But he added that he loves playing blitz \u2014 a fast-paced form of chess \u2014 and wanted fans to be able to watch, and that he was encouraged by his discussions with the federation after Friday's showdown.",
      "\u201cI think we sort of all want the same thing,\u201d he suggested in the video on his Take Take Take chess app\u2019s YouTube channel. \u201cWe want the players to be comfortable, sure, but also relatively presentable.\u201d",
      "The events began when Carlsen wore jeans and a sportcoat Friday to the Rapid World Championship, which is separate from but held in conjunction with the blitz event. The chess federation said Friday that longstanding rules prohibit jeans at those tournaments, and players are lodged nearby to make sartorial switch-ups easy if needed.",
      "An official fined Carlsen $200 and asked him to change pants, but he refused and wasn't paired for a ninth-round game, the federation said at the time. The organization noted that another grandmaster, Ian Nepomniachtchi, was fined earlier in the day for wearing sports shoes, changed and continued to play.",
      "Carlsen has said that he offered to wear something else the next day, but officials were unyielding. He said \u201cit became a bit of a matter of principle,\u201d so he quit the rapid and blitz championships.",
      "In the video posted Sunday, he questioned whether he had indeed broken a rule and said changing clothes would have needlessly interrupted his concentration between games. He called the punishment \u201cunbelievably harsh.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, I could have changed. Obviously, I didn\u2019t want to,\u201d he said, and \u201cI stand by that.\u201d"

      "Yet these were the lucky ones.",
      "At least they can be repaired and put back out to sea. Many others sank, taking entire family incomes with them.",
      "When Beryl lashed Barbados, the island's fishing fleet was devastated in a matter of hours. About 75% of the active fleet was damaged, with 88 boats totally destroyed.",
      "Charles Carter, who owns a blue-and-black fishing vessel called Joyce, was among those affected.",
      "\"It's been real bad, I can tell you. I had to change both sides of the hull, up to the waterline,\" he says, pointing at the now pristine boat in front of us.",
      "It has taken months of restoration and thousands of dollars to get it back to this point, during which time Charles has barely been able to fish.",
      "\"That's my living, my livelihood, fishing is all I do,\" he says.",
      "\"The fishing industry is mash up,\" echoes his friend, Captain Euride. \"We're just trying to get back the pieces.\"",
      "Now, six months after the storm, there are signs of calmer waters. On a warm Saturday, several repaired vessels were put back into the ocean with the help of a crane, a trailer and some government support.",
      "Seeing Joyce back on the water is a welcome sight for all fishermen in Barbados.",
      "But Barbadians are acutely aware that climate change means more active and powerful Atlantic hurricane seasons - and it may be just another year or two before the fishing industry is struck again. Beryl, for example, was the earliest-forming Category 5 storm on record.",
      "Few understand the extent of the problem better than the island's Chief Fisheries Officer, Dr Shelly Ann Cox.",
      "\"Our captains have been reporting that sea conditions have changed,\" she explains. \"Higher swells, sea surface temperatures are much warmer and they're having difficulty getting flying fish now at the beginning of our pelagic season.\"",
      "The flying fish is a national symbol in Barbados and a key part of the island's cuisine. But climate change has been harming the stocks for years.",
      "At the Oistins Fish Market in Bridgetown, flying fish are still available, along with marlin, mahi-mahi and tuna, though only a handful of stalls are open.",
      "At one of them, Cornelius Carrington, from the Freedom Fish House. fillets a kingfish with the speed and dexterity of a man who has spent many years with a fish knife in his hands.",
      "\"Beryl was like a surprise attack, like an ambush,\" says Cornelius, in a deep baritone voice, over the market's chatter, reggae and thwack of cleavers on chopping boards.",
      "Cornelius lost one of his two boats in Hurricane Beryl. \"It's the first time a hurricane has come from the south like that, normally storms hit us from the north,\" he said.",
      "Although his second boat allowed him to stay afloat financially, Cornelius thinks the hand of climate change is increasingly present in the fishermen's fate.",
      "\"Right now, everything has changed. The tides are changing, the weather is changing, the temperature of the sea, the whole pattern has changed.\"",
      "The effects are also being felt in the tourism industry, he says, with hotels and restaurants struggling to find enough fish to meet demand each month.",
      "For Dr Shelly Ann Cox, public education is key and, she says, the message is getting through.",
      "\"Perhaps because we are an island and we're so connected to the water, people in Barbados can speak well on the impact on climate change and what that means for our country,\" she says.",
      "\"I think if you speak to children as well, they're very knowledgeable about the topic.\"",
      "To see for myself, I visited a secondary school \u2013 Harrison College \u2013 as a member of a local NGO, the Caribbean Youth Environmental Network (CYEN), talked to members of the school's Environmental Club about climate change.",
      "The CYEN representative, Sheldon Marshall, is an energy expert who quizzed the pupils about greenhouse gases and the steps they could take at home to help reduce carbon emissions on the island.",
      "\"How can you, as young people in Barbados, help make a difference on climate change?\" he asked them.",
      "Following an engaging and lively debate, I asked the pupils how they felt about Barbados being on the front line of global climate change, despite having only a small carbon footprint itself.",
      "\"Personally, I take a very pessimistic view,\" said 17-year-old Isabella Fredricks.",
      "\"We are a very small country. No matter how hard we try to change, if the big countries \u2013 the main producers of pollution like America, India and China \u2013 don't make a change, everything we do is going to be pointless.\"",

    "title": "What we know about US visas Trump supporters are clashing over",
    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:05:18 GMT",
    "summary": "A row has erupted over a long-standing US visa programme, We looked into the figures behind the scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

    "story": [
      "Even if you were lucky enough to get a new console or games this Christmas, you've probably got your eye on some upcoming releases.",
      "And 2025 is shaping up to be a big one.",
      "Most agree that 2024 was a painful year for the games industry, with tens of thousands of layoffs and worldwide studio closures.",
      "There's a hope that things will bounce back - at least in part - next year.",
      "And two huge releases in particular are likely to cut through in a big way.",
      "Grand Theft Auto 6",
      "A cultural moment, a day millions of gamers have been awaiting for a very, very long time.",
      "The release of Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6).",
      "It's due to land in autumn, 12 years after predecessor GTA 5 arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, breaking launch records.",
      "The sequel already broke records with its first trailer, which racked up an astonishing 90 million views in 24 hours when it debuted last December.",
      "And that probably won't be the last record that will be broken.",
      "\"The anticipation for this is impossible to measure,\" says James Batchelor, editor-in-chief of GamesIndustry.biz.",
      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",
      "The big question on most fans' minds is whether the release date will slip, as has happened for previous big releases from Rockstar.",
      "James says he's seen nothing to suggest that it will - yet - but if things stay quiet it's time to start worrying.",
      "\"If we still have seen absolutely nothing by summer, and certainly if we've seen nothing of it by, say, end of August, then yeah, that's going to 2026,\" he says.",
      "Why is GTA 6 so important?",
      "The release of GTA 6 is expected to have an impact on the wider games industry.",
      "\"I think it will probably be one of those moments where the rising tide is going to lift all of the boats,\" says George Osborn, consultant and author of the Video Games Industry Memo newsletter.",
      "He says a big hit - especially one with the cultural resonance of GTA - can get more people \"in the mood to buy video games\" and publishers want to capitalise on that.",
      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",
      "Many gamers are still sticking with their previous-generation machines, and Sony and Microsoft will be hoping GTA 6 will finally inspire them to upgrade.",
      "\"If anything is going to convince people to jump to a new console if they haven't already it's going to be GTA 6,\" says James, who estimates that PlayStation 4 users still count for 50% of Sony's active players.",
      "But if we're talking hardware upgrades, there could be some competition.",
      "A new Nintendo Switch?",
      "Here's what we know, officially, about Nintendo's next console.",
      "It exists.",
      "Your current Switch games will work on it.",
      "And that's it.",
      "There's no official name yet, but fans have been calling it the Nintendo Switch 2.",
      "Despite unconfirmed leaks and rumours the machine's capabilities remain a mystery and the company's promised some sort of official announcement by the end of March.",
      "There's a feeling, though, that Nintendo won't want to change the winning formula of the original Switch, which has sold 146 million units since its 2017 launch.",
      "\"The sensible money is on just a bigger, better Switch,\" says James.",
      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",
      "But James isn't sure it will experience the same fate.",
      "\"That was a long time ago,\" he says. \"I think they've learned a lot of lessons since then.\"",
      "More breakout hits",
      "Some of 2024's biggest success stories came from small, independent developers.",
      "The most notable was Balatro - an addictive, poker-inspired card game that ended the year in the running for high-profile game of the year awards.",
      "Journalist Rachel Watts, who hosts the Indieventure podcast, feels that has helped to set the stage for more breakout success this year.",
      "\"There's been so many great indies this year,\" she says.",
      "\"On the triple-A side a lot of critics and players have said 'it's such a quiet year, there's not many big releases', but for indie games, there's always so many cool things to play.\"",
      "A success like Balatro is incredibly rare, and one of the big issues for indie developers in 2024 has been discoverability - getting players to actually find your game.",
      "Rachel says the number of releases on Steam - the online store where most PC games are bought - is \"frankly bonkers\" and getting noticed is \"one of the most difficult things\".",
      "\"I just don't see that becoming any easier,\" she says.",
      "Rachel says indie developers are also struggling to find investment and the financial outlook is \"pretty bleak\" going into 2025.",
      "But she does think that more gamers are starting to recognise the creativity that exists in the sector - and more breakout hits will follow.",
      "\"The indie space is a place where I retreat to just play games that get me excited about gaming again,\" says Rachel.",
      "\"If Balatro can knock elbows with some of the biggest titles of the year, then I'm hoping other other indies will.\"",

      "\"I think it's an important moment because the Olympic movement has traditionally not been too keen on esports,\" says George.",
      "After years of campaigning the International Olympics Committee agreed a 12-year deal with Saudi Arabia to host the gaming version.",
      "The first esports World Cup took place in the kingdom this summer, and George says the event \"didn't really cut through\" to a wider audience.",
      "\"It'll be interesting to see whether or not the eSports Olympics with the official IOC branding and the official Olympic movement branding behind it has a different impact,\" says George.",
      "Some fans, players and commentators boycotted the World Cup in protest over Saudi Arabia's human rights records.",
      "George says the esports Olympics will revive conversations about sportswashing - the idea that Saudi Arabia uses its vast wealth to invest in sports and entertainment to improve its international reputation - something it's denied.",
      "\"You have this really interesting thing,\" says George.",
      "\"Your big esports moment - esports becomes an Olympic sport.",

      "A machine removes the red husks, and the pale beans inside are washed and passed along concrete channels, ending up on lines of drying platforms that sweep across the valley.",
      "Here, workers categorise the beans into grades, the highest destined for the coffee houses of Europe.",
      "\"We call coffee the black gold around here,\" Mr Macharia, whose farm covers 2.5 hectares (six acres) , told the BBC.",
      "He grows the Kenya AA coffee beans, which are prized worldwide for their high quality, full body, deep aromas and fruity flavour.",

      "Now, the area is famous for its unique, top-rated coffee.",

      "Farmers feel the trading system between Kenya and Europe - the world's largest coffee market - has been stacked against them for many years.",
      "But now, a new threat looms, jeopardising farmers' ability to make a living - climate change.",
      "Coffee trees are extremely sensitive to small differences in temperature and weather conditions.",

      "As a result, \"coffee production has decreased over the last few years\".",
      "He added that climate change was intensifying the spread of diseases in coffee plants.",
      "Mr Murigi said there had been a significant increase in coffee leaf miners, bugs that feed on coffee leaves, and coffee berry disease, a destructive fungal infection that can wipe out more than 80% of crops.",
      "To deal with the increasing outbreaks, farmers are resorting to using herbicides and insecticides that can damage soil quality in the long term and also pose health risks.",

      "Farmer Joseph Kimani told the BBC that the \"river levels have gone down a lot\" due to erratic weather, such as periods of drought and heavy rains.",
      "He said that because of the lack of rain, farmers are forced to use more river water.",
      "But this increased reliance on river water, driven by the lack of rainfall, may be further straining the already limited water supply.",
      "While Mr Murigi acknowledges the rise in water use by coffee farmers, he denies this is why the river is drying up.",
      "However, with 23 coffee societies in this region, a significant amount of water is clearly being used in the coffee growing process in Kiambu County.",
      "Komothia's story is not unique. As global temperatures and droughts increase, good coffee will become difficult to grow in all parts of the world.",
      "Coffee can only be grown in the \"coffee belt\" - tropical regions around the world in areas typically located at an altitude of between 1,000m and 2,000m.",
      "In recent years, climate change has led to a shortage of global coffee supplies and an increase in the price of coffee due to drought and crop failures in several key coffee-producing nations such as Brazil and Vietnam.",
      "A survey by Fairtrade International, the organisation behind Fairtrade labels, found that 93% of Kenyan coffee farmers are already experiencing the effects of climate change.",
      "The coffee industry in Kenya is a key source of employment, providing jobs for an estimated 150,000 people.",
      "To protect the industry, coffee farmers in areas like Komothai are experimenting with climate adaptation techniques, such as planting trees to provide extra shade for the coffee plants.",

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the chancellor and business secretary have written to the UK's main regulators asking them to come up with ideas for reform that could boost economic growth.",
      "They contacted watchdogs, including energy regulator Ofgem and water regulator Ofwat, before Christmas asking them to submit proposals by mid-January.",
      "This comes after figures published earlier this week indicated the UK economy had flatlined between July and September.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the letter \"says all you need to know\" about Sir Keir's government, claiming he has to \"beg his own government to create growth after Labour's damaging Budget\".",
      "UK economy had zero growth between July and September",
      "Get serious on pay in 2025, TUC chief tells ministers",
      "The letter - which is also understood to have been sent to the Environment Agency, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and healthcare regulators - was first reported by Sky News.",
      "Signed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, it said ministers believed collaboration to be essential to ensure the regulatory environment became \"more pro-growth and pro-investment\" while respecting the independence of regulators.",
      "The FCA said it would reply in the new year. It added that it had already delivered measures since the summer to support growth, including reforming information that retail investors receive, as well as making proposals to provide better value for money for workplace pensions.",
      "The letter said improving regulation to enable growth and not hold back investment was \"an essential part\" of the government's growth mission.",
      "Economic growth is a principal reason behind many major policy announcements, from Communities Secretary Angela Rayner unveiling reforms to the planning system in order to boost house-building, to the chancellor encouraging more \"sensible risk-taking\" in financial services companies.",
      "This letter is evidence that Sir Keir wants to pull every possible governmental lever to make sure arms-length bodies like regulators, as well as government departments, prioritise helping deliver Labour's mission of achieving the highest sustained economic growth in the G7.",
      "It is also an indication that the prime minister fears regulators can restrain economic growth by imposing obstacles to business activity \u2013 a message typically more associated with Conservative politicians but which Starmer is increasingly putting at the heart of his plans.",
      "In a speech earlier this month, Starmer said that \"the regulators, the blockers and bureaucrats\" were part of an \"alliance of naysayers\" who mean that \"we can't get things done in our country.\"",
      "And in October, addressing a summit of international investors in London, he said: \"We've got to look at regulation across the piece, and where it is needlessly holding back investment\u2026 mark my words, we will get rid of it\".",
      "On the other side of the argument will be groups in various sectors where there is a regulator, who argue that what the government sees as obstacles are in fact necessary rules.",
      "Conservative MP Griffith said that if the prime minister wants the UK to exhibit the fastest growth in the G7, then \"he'd have more luck turning the clock back to before the general election when the UK was growing under the Conservatives\".",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Keir warned MPs it would take some time for people to feel their living standards improve.",
      "This week Reeves also said the challenge was to fix the economy \"after 15 years of neglect is huge\", while shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the figures showed \"growth has tanked on Labour's watch\"."

      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",

      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",
      "The France rape trial throws up a difficult question about porn fantasies - and male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?",
      "\"I see Trump's feelings towards a platform dictating the way his administration views them,\" argues Mr Freeman.",
      "The question that remains is what Trump's views on this really are - and whether he will demand accountability in a different way from these sites in the future, or not at all.",
      "The ramifications, whichever way it goes, will no doubt be far-reaching.",

      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "This has been a miserable year for Boeing. Not only has it struggled to cope with a safety and quality control crisis, it has lost billions of dollars following a strike by workers that paralysed production at two of its biggest factories.",
      "Even its space programme has been in trouble. Two astronauts were left stranded on the International Space Station in June after their Boeing Starliner capsule developed a potential fault, which would have made returning to Earth in it too dangerous.",
      "On top of all this, the company faces a crisis of confidence from within its own ranks, says Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical and economic analyst at industry consultants Leeham Company.",
      "\"People in Boeing don't believe in words from top management any more,\" he says.",
      "Sam Mohawk is a 51-year-old quality assurance investigator at Boeing's factory in Renton near Seattle, a huge plant where the 737 Max is built. It is the company's best-selling aircraft, but one with a chequered safety record.",
      "Earlier this year Mr Mohawk came forward as a whistleblower, claiming that chaos on the factory floor in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic had led to thousands of faulty or \"non-conforming\" parts going missing, and potentially being fitted aboard aircraft that have since been sent to customers.",
      "\"The whole system was just in shambles,\" he says of that period. \"It [had] kind of just broken down.\"",
      "His allegations came to light in June when they were referred to during a congressional hearing in Washington DC into safety failures at the aerospace giant.",
      "During the session, Boeing's top bosses were accused by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of \"strip-mining\" the company for profit and cutting corners on safety in order to boost earnings.",
      "David Calhoun, who was Boeing's chief executive at the time, said he \"didn't recognise\" Mr Hawley's depiction of the company. \"That is not the way we operate,\" Mr Calhoun said back then. \"I am proud of every action we have taken.\"",
      "Since then, Boeing has appointed a new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, who has pledged to \"restore trust\" in the business, overhaul its corporate culture and prioritise the safety of passengers. The company is also in the process of implementing a comprehensive safety and quality plan, which was launched earlier in the year.",
      "But according to Mr Mohawk, who still works at Boeing, the drive to build planes as quickly as possible in order to maximise revenues remains. The accountants, he insists, are \"100%\" running the operation.",
      "\"Nothing has changed,\" says Mr Mohawk. \"Our executives talk to the press and say, 'quality and safety is our number one priority'. But it's just the same.\"",
      "Boeing rejects Mr Mohawk's claims. It insists they have been thoroughly investigated and that none of them were found to be valid.",
      "In a statement, it said: \"Boeing data systems do track parts, including non-conforming parts. The investigations into Mr Mohawk's claims found no evidence that defective parts were installed on Boeing planes, and none of the issues raised affected safety.\"",
      "Another Boeing employee called Nathan (not his real name), who works in the company's Everett factory in Washington state, where the 777 is built, describes low staff morale and corners being cut on the production line. Employees \"don't always follow the rules because they feel the pressure from their manager, and so they are not taking steps to ensure their own safety\", he claims.",
      "But Mike Dunlop, an aerospace industry veteran and author of a book about turning around failing businesses, argues that Boeing has in fact already begun the process of transforming itself by going back to basics.",
      "He believes many of Boeing's problems result from the arrogance of the company's management in the past, as it sought to cut costs in an effort to make more money. Recently, he says, there have been some improvements.",
      "\"I've seen the biggest changes in the company since the 1960s. What Kelly Ortberg is doing is focusing back on their core principles, which is to build airplanes as effectively and safely as possible, and be a reliable supplier to the airlines.\"",
      "Arguably, the market needs Boeing to be healthy. It remains a huge company, employing more than 150,000 people directly, and countless more in supply chains around the world. It is a significant contributor to the US economy.",
      "But some insiders argue that it now has a credibility problem and needs to restore confidence.",
      "Crashes and the 737 Max",
      "Boeing's challenging year began on 5 January with a routine evening flight from Portland International Airport in Oregon to Ontario, California. The plane, a brand-new Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines, had taken off minutes earlier and was climbing when something went badly wrong.",
      "\"Er, yeah, we'd like to go down,\" a female voice said over the radio as the crisis erupted at 16,000ft. \"Alaska 1282 declaring an emergency\u2026 we're descending to 10,000\u2026 we're depressurised.\"",
      "Moments earlier on the flight deck, First Officer Emily Wiprud had been exchanging routine messages with air traffic control, then there was a loud bang, a sudden rush of wind and her radio headset was torn off. Air pressure in the aircraft plummeted, as did the temperature.",
      "Ms Wiprud and the captain hurriedly put on oxygen masks, then worked together with calm urgency to bring the damaged aircraft to the ground.",
      "What had happened was deeply disturbing. A panel fitted over an unused emergency exit had not been bolted into place properly and had come away as the plane was climbing, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the incident.",
      "The passengers were still strapped in and no one was seriously hurt. But as investigators pointed out, it could have been much worse.",
      "What made the incident stand out was the fact that the 737 Max was Boeing's newest aircraft and its bestselling model in history.",
      "Since its entry into service, more than 1,600 have been sent to airlines and a further 4,800 are on order. But even before this, its safety record was tarnished.",
      "In late 2018, an aircraft went down in the sea off the coast of Indonesia. Four months later another plane crashed minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. A total of 346 people were killed.",
      "Both accidents were ultimately blamed on a poorly designed piece of flight control software. This had been fitted to address handling quirks on the new plane, and prevent pilots, who were used to earlier versions of the 737, from needing expensive retraining.",
      "In practice, it became active at the wrong time, and forced both aircraft into catastrophic dives, according to investigators.",
      "Did cost cutting 'jeopardise safety'?",
      "Some critics blame these accidents on a focus on the bottom line at the expense of safety. In a statement, The Foundation for Aviation Safety, which is chaired by ex-Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson, said: \"Attention to share price and profit margins alone has proven to be a flawed strategy.\"",
      "In the aftermath of those crashes, the 737 Max was grounded for 20 months as regulators examined every aspect of its design.",
      "The company faced criticism over its corporate culture. A congressional report released in September 2020 found that Boeing's rush to build new aircraft as quickly as possible while cutting costs had \"jeopardised the safety of the flying public\" \u2013 although its findings were described as \"partisan\" by one leading Republican.",
      "The incident in Portland, however, was the result of the failure by Boeing engineers to bolt the door panel back on properly, after it had been removed to repair manufacturing flaws. Yet it placed the company in the spotlight again.",
      "In particular, it drew attention to a series of continuing quality problems that had been occurring behind the scenes at the aircraft-maker and at its main supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which makes a number of large aircraft components including the main body.",
      "These included manufacturing defects affecting parts of fuselages, tail and rudder assemblies, as well as sealants applied as protection against the effect of lightning strikes in central fuel tanks.",
      "But the incident also placed a renewed focus on claims made by whistleblowers from within both companies, who had suggested that the pressure from Boeing to produce aircraft quickly, and ramp up production, had compromised safety on both the 737 and 787 programmes.",
      "The sudden deaths of two other whistleblowers \u2013 John Barnett, who had worked in Boeing's 787 factory in South Carolina, and Josh Dean, who had been employed by Spirit \u2013 generated further headlines in 2024. It resulted in pushing the wider story about Boeing once again into the news.",
      "US politicians made their feelings clear. Richard Blumenthal, head of the Senate subcommittee on investigations said: \"Boeing has put profits and speed of production ahead of quality and safety, and ultimately, that failing is at the core of its current difficulties.\"",
      "The strike that 'cost Boeing $5.5 billion'",
      "After the Portland incident, Boeing was ordered by the US Department of Transportation to produce a comprehensive action plan \"to address its systemic quality control and production issues\".",
      "The aerospace giant responded by publishing a detailed strategy aimed at improving its production systems, gaining more control over its supply chain, and encouraging employees to speak up on safety and quality control issues.",
      "It also promised to strengthen its training programmes and overhaul critical processes on the production line.",
      "On 1 July, Boeing reached an agreement to take control of Spirit as part of its efforts to resolve quality problems.",
      "There were also changes at the top of the company when Mr Calhoun, who had become chief executive a year after the incidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia, stepped down and was replaced in August by Mr Ortberg, a veteran engineer who had spent decades in the industry.",
      "But weeks after his appointment, Boeing faced further crisis when more than 30,000 unionised workers - most of them in the company's Washington State heartlands - went on strike over a new four-year contract, and how much Boeing would increase pay and other benefits for its workers.",
      "The walkout, which began in September and lasted for seven weeks, held up production of the 737 Max, the 777 and the 767 freighter.",
      "In the past, the company had become accustomed to negotiating from a position of strength, only this time it was in a weak position, and according to Bjorn Fehrm, employees were out for revenge.",
      "\"It was obvious to them that the old management had basically screwed them. That was the sentiment. They were absolutely disgusted with how they had been treated in the old contract,\" he explains.",
      "The result was a bitter dispute, at a time when the company was trying to instil a new working culture, and Mr Ortberg had promised to \"reset\" relations with its employees.",
      "Boeing had to dig deep to come up with a deal that satisfied their demands, which included a 38% pay rise over four years. According to consultants Anderson Economic Group, the strike cost the company more than $5.5 billion.",
      "Airbus versus Boeing: the fallout",
      "All of this came at a time when the aerospace giant was already struggling financially. In the first nine months of 2024 it racked up losses of nearly $8bn (\u00a36.3bn). As a result, it set out plans to cut 17,000 jobs, or a tenth of its workforce.",
      "Boeing's problems have taken a heavy toll on its business. Where once it went toe to toe with its European rival Airbus, it has now delivered fewer aircraft in each of the past five years.",
      "In the first nine months of 2024 it distributed 291 planes to its customers, while Airbus provided 497, according to Forecast International.",
      "For its customers, this has been frustrating. Ryanair, one of the biggest buyers of the 737 Max, has cut its growth forecasts for next year. In the US, Southwest Airlines has had to make job cuts.",
      "Yet Airbus is not in a position to take full advantage of this. Its own order books are full to bursting, with a backlog of nearly 8,700 planes. Like its rival, it has experienced problems with suppliers, leading to delays.",
      "Meanwhile, airlines want new planes. Estimates from both Boeing and Airbus suggest more than 40,000 new aircraft will be needed over the next two decades.",
      "The current generation of aircraft are much more efficient and cheaper to run than their predecessors. So delays in renewing their fleets will cost airlines money \u2013 potentially leading to higher ticket prices for their passengers - as well as hampering efforts to improve their environmental performance.",
      "According to Mr Fehrm, all this creates an opening for a third player to take a stake in the market. \"Over the next five to 10 years there will be a gap between what the market is asking for and what Airbus and Boeing can deliver by thousands of aircraft.",
      "\"So it's open for a third player. Brazilian manufacturer Embraer is a candidate. Or it's going to be a chance for Comac, the Chinese supplier, to come into different markets and say, 'Actually, we can do a decent job here.'\"",
      "A 'borderline miraculous' revival?",
      "In early December Mike Whitaker, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), visited the factory in Renton near Seattle that Mr Mohawk has raised concerns about. At the time, Mr Whitaker said: \"What's truly needed is a fundamental cultural shift that's oriented around safety, quality improvement and effective employee engagement and training.",
      "\"As expected, Boeing has made progress executing its comprehensive plan in these areas, and we will continue to closely monitor the results as they begin to ramp up production following the strike.\"",
      "But for many experts, the problems at Boeing go back decades \u2013 and are unlikely to be solved overnight.",
      "\"The hardest thing to change in large companies is the mindset of people,\" says Mr Fehrm. \"It takes time, and it needs to be manifested in actions, doing things differently.",
      "\"There are changes coming, but people won't look at what the top management under Kelly Ortberg say. They will look for actions.\"",
      "Some observers believe Mr Ortberg has an opportunity now to improve the company's fortunes. Mr Dunlop thinks a change in mindset will be fundamental to Boeing's future.",
      "\"The fastest way to turn around a company is to have a complete change in attitude on how you treat your employees, how you treat your customers, and most importantly in how you treat your suppliers.\"",
      "A complete reversal of its previous approach could produce a \"borderline miraculous\" revival, he believes.",
      "But others are less confident. Captain Dennis Tajer, the lead spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association (the pilots' union for American Airlines), believes real change at Boeing has to come, not from the boardroom, but from further down the company's ranks.",
      "\"The solution is below senior management,\" he argues.",
      "\"It's at the middle management level, where you find the gatekeepers and the people who support doing things properly, not just keeping the schedule going.\"",
      "The stakes, he insists, could not be higher.",

      "\"A couple of years ago I'd have one poster up in the window and about six applicants coming in. It's so different.\"",
      "Mr Barry said the rural location and \"unsociable hours\" made it trickier for some people but said he \"loved coming to work\" and meeting the customers.",
      "Samantha Harper, managing director of Red Dragon Pubs, which owns the pub Mr Barry works in, said it felt like the industry had been in \"perma-crisis\" since Covid.",
      "Ms Harper said at the height of staffing difficulties she'd offered \u00a3500 to any member of staff at her seven pubs who could find her a chef.",
      "\"We had no staff and we just couldn't find any,\" she said.",
      "\"We did [the \u00a3500 reward] for a year. During that whole time we only got one person. They only lasted 12 weeks and then they left.\"",
      "Ms Harper said her chain had also tried paying for a month-long advert in The Caterer, but had just a single applicant, who would have needed to relocate from Bangladesh.",
      "'We've had shortages of people who want to clean rooms'",
      "\"You just have to look down the street here to see how difficult it is,\" she said.",
      "\"When we bought the Red Lion four years ago, there were four pubs here - now there's just us, that's how difficult it is.\"",
      "She said they relied on their \"fantastic\" existing staff, but wished more people would give working in hospitality a chance.",
      "One hotel owner in north Wales \u2013 who asked not to be named \u2013 said he'd been forced to mothball entire floors of rooms at his hotels, sometimes for weeks, because there were not enough staff to service them.",
      "The owner, who was worried identifying his hotels could harm their business, said he'd also had to cut back the hours their bars and restaurants were open \u2013 sometimes serving cold food only.",
      "He described the measures as a \"last resort\" and said despite a reluctance to admit problems in the industry, he was sure many were affected.",
      "David Chapman, executive director of UK Hospitality Cymru, said having to mothball rooms wasn't uncommon.",
      "\"I know of floors closing, of rooms being closed. We've had shortages of people who want to clean rooms. We've had shortages of chefs. We're really adaptive as an industry and people come up with these solutions, but I think that's levelled off now.\"",
      "Mr Chapman said he felt the industry had struggled with \"myths\" about poor pay and long hours.",
      "\"We've had to encourage people to join us,\" he said.",
      "\"Wages have increased by about 50% in the last four years. Obviously, it's difficult in our industry where you have to serve people on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays when people want to go out.\"",
      "Mr Chapman said many hotels and restaurants he knew of were working hard to make their jobs more flexible and he wanted more people to consider hospitality as a \"career\" rather than a short-term job.",
      "He said he hoped Wales' new tourism tax could be an opportunity to invest money back into the industry and he wanted to see revenue going towards bids for big events or concerts to be hosted here.",
      "A spokesperson for the Welsh government said it was working with businesses to help them \"access funding for training and to ensure more year-round, permanent, quality jobs\".",
      "\"We are investing an additional \u00a378m to provide a sixth successive year of support for retail, leisure and hospitality businesses with their non-domestic rates bills,\" they said."

      "Boxing Day shoppers stayed away from the High Street and shopping centres, compared with last year, footfall data suggests.",
      "Data gathered by MRI Software showed footfall on UK high streets was down 6.2% on 2023, while shopping centres saw a 4.2% fall in visitors.",
      "The figures are an early sign that online shopping continues to dominate the traditional Boxing Day sales.",
      "Although many shops still expected to see brisk trade on Thursday, major retailers such as John Lewis, M&S and Next chose not to open the majority of their stores, saying they wanted to give their staff a break over the festive period.",
      "One of those out shopping on Boxing Day, Lorna, was deal-hunting with her mother and sister in Liverpool.",
      "She told BBC News this year is the first time she had decided to head out a bit later, arriving at Liverpool's shopping district at 10:30.",
      "\"Me and mum come every Boxing Day. Normally we're up and queuing at 5am, we've been here every year for the past 10 or 15 years but this is the first time we've been late,\" she said.",

      "\"I'll go shopping with her and she'll come to the Liverpool match with me,\" he said.",
      "The data suggests in-store visits are 20.8% below pre-pandemic levels.",
      "Overall Boxing Day activity levels were down 4.9% across all UK retail destinations, compared with 26 December last year.",
      "Analysts have told BBC News that bricks-and-mortar stores are becoming less profitable as they are expensive to keep open due to rising energy costs and, for some, Bank Holiday overtime pay for staff.",
      "Online shops are cheaper to operate and generally have fewer overheads.",
      "MRI Software's Jenni Matthews said a year-on-year rise in footfall is anticipated from 27 December.",
      "But she added that this year's fall in shoppers on Boxing Day was a \"major contrast\" with 2023, when footfall was 4% higher than the previous year.",
      "\"This could be reflective of the shift in consumer behaviour influenced by the ongoing cost-of-living crisis,\" she said.",
      "Sales volumes in clothing stores recently fell to their lowest level since January 2022, according to ONS figures, with retailers saying economic factors were to blame.",
      "UK retail parks, which often offer free parking and are more suited to bigger shops, fared slightly better, seeing only a 2.9% fall in visits compared with last year.",
      "In many ways Boxing Day is no longer a major shopping event in itself, as it was in the past.",

    "summary": "Manmohan Singh was instrumental in bringing India out of economic and nuclear isolation.",
    "story": [
      "Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has died at the age of 92.",
      "Singh was one of India's longest-serving prime ministers and he was considered the architect of key liberalising economic reforms, as premier from 2004-2014 and before that as finance minister.",
      "He had been admitted to a hospital in the capital Delhi after his health condition deteriorated, reports say.",
      "Among those who paid tribute to Singh on Thursday were Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who wrote on social media that \"India mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished leaders\".",
      "Modi said that Singh's \"wisdom and humility were always visible\" during their interactions and that he had \"made extensive efforts to improve people's lives\" during his time as prime minister.",
      "Priyanka Gandhi, the daughter of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and a Congress party member, said that Singh was \"genuinely egalitarian, wise, strong-willed and courageous until the end\".",
      "Her brother Rahul, who leads Congress, said he had \"lost a mentor and guide\".",
      "Singh was the first Indian leader since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after serving a full first term, and the first Sikh to hold the country's top post. He made a public apology in parliament for the 1984 riots in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed.",
      "But his second term in office was marred by a string of corruption allegations that dogged his administration. The scandals, many say, were partially responsible for his Congress party's crushing defeat in the 2014 general election.",
      "Singh was born on 26 September 1932, in a desolate village in the Punjab province of undivided India, which lacked both water and electricity.",
      "After attending Panjab University he took a master's degree at the University of Cambridge and then a DPhil at Oxford.",
      "While studying at Cambridge, the lack of funds bothered Singh, his daughter, Daman Singh, wrote in a book on her parents.",
      "\"His tuition and living expenses came to about \u00a3600 a year. The Panjab University scholarship gave him about \u00a3160. For the rest he had to depend on his father. Manmohan was careful to live very stingily. Subsidised meals in the dining hall were relatively cheap at two shillings sixpence.\"",
      "Daman Singh remembered her father as \"completely helpless about the house and could neither boil an egg, nor switch on the television\".",
      "Consensus builder",
      "Singh rose to political prominence as India's finance minister in 1991, taking over as the country was plunging into bankruptcy.",
      "His unexpected appointment capped a long and illustrious career as an academic and civil servant - he served as an economic adviser to the government, and became the governor of India's central bank.",
      "In his maiden speech as finance minister he famously quoted Victor Hugo, saying that \"no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come\".",
      "That served as a launchpad for an ambitious and unprecedented economic reform programme: he cut taxes, devalued the rupee, privatised state-run companies and encouraged foreign investment.",
      "The economy revived, industry picked up, inflation was checked and growth rates remained consistently high in the 1990s.",
      "'Accidental PM'",
      "Manmohan Singh was a man acutely aware of his lack of a political base. \"It is nice to be a statesman, but in order to be a statesman in a democracy you first have to win elections,\" he once said.",
      "When he tried to win election to India's lower house in 1999, he was defeated. He sat instead in the upper house, chosen by his own Congress party.",
      "The same happened in 2004, when Singh was first appointed prime minister after Congress president Sonia Gandhi turned down the post - apparently to protect the party from damaging attacks over her Italian origins. Critics however alleged that Sonia Gandhi was the real source of power while he was prime minister, and that he was never truly in charge.",
      "The biggest triumph during his first five-year term was to bring India out of nuclear isolation by signing a landmark deal securing access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal came at a price - the government's Communist allies withdrew support after protesting against it, and Congress had to make up lost numbers by enlisting the support of another party amid charges of vote-buying.",
      "A consensus builder, Singh presided over a coalition of sometimes difficult, assertive and potentially unruly regional coalition allies and supporters.",
      "Although he earned respect for his integrity and intelligence, he also had a reputation for being soft and indecisive. Some critics claimed that the pace of reform slowed and he failed to achieve the same momentum he had while finance minister.",
      "When Singh guided Congress to a second, decisive election victory in 2009, he vowed that the party would \"rise to the occasion\".",
      "But the gloss soon began to wear off and his second term was in the news mostly for all the wrong reasons: several scandals involving his cabinet ministers which allegedly cost the country billions of dollars, a parliament stalled by the opposition, and a huge policy paralysis that resulted in a serious economic downturn.",
      "LK Advani, a senior leader in the rival BJP party, called Singh India's \"weakest prime minister\".",
      "Manmohan Singh defended his record, saying his government had worked with \"utmost commitment and dedication for the country and the welfare of its people\".",
      "Pragmatic foreign policy",
      "Singh adopted the pragmatic foreign policies pursued by his two predecessors.",
      "He continued the peace process with Pakistan - though this process was hampered by attacks blamed on Pakistani militants, culminating in the Mumbai gun and bomb attack of November 2008.",
      "He tried to end the border dispute with China, brokering a deal to reopen the Nathu La pass into Tibet which had been closed for more than 40 years.",
      "Singh increased financial support for Afghanistan and became the first Indian leader to visit the country for nearly 30 years.",
      "He also angered many opposition politicians by appearing to end relations with India's old ally, Iran.",
      "A low-profile leader",
      "A studious former academic and bureaucrat, he was known for being self-effacing and always kept a low profile. His social media account was noted mostly for dull entries and had a limited number of followers.",
      "A man of few words, his calm demeanour nevertheless won him many admirers.",
      "Responding to questions on a coal scandal involving the illegal allocation of licences worth billions of dollars, he defended his silence on the issue by saying it was \"better than thousands of answers\".",
      "In 2015 he was summoned to appear in court to answer allegations of criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and corruption related offences. An upset Singh told reporters that he was \"open for legal scrutiny\" and that the \"truth will prevail\".",
      "After his time as premier, Singh remained deeply engaged with the issues of the day as a senior leader of the main opposition Congress party despite his advancing age.",
      "In August 2020, he told the BBC in a rare interview that India needed to take three steps \"immediately\" to stem the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic, which had sent the country's economy into a recession.",
      "The government needed to provide direct cash assistance to people, make capital available for businesses, and fix the financial sector, he said.",
      "History will remember Singh for bringing India out of economic and nuclear isolation, although some historians may suggest he should have retired earlier.",
      "\"I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament,\" he told an interviewer in 2014.",
      "Singh is survived by his wife and three daughters."

      "But one year on, Ms Crosbie told the BBC that she has observed a noticeable difference in office attendance.",
      "\"We find, certainly at Nationwide... that men are more likely to come into the office than women\".",
      "She added that observing and interacting with leaders is crucial for growth, noting the impact of having a female chief executive act as her mentor early in her career.",
      "\"Being seen and then seeing other leaders is a really important part of development,\" Ms Crosbie explained.",
      "\"I benefited enormously from watching some really excellent leaders and how they navigated challenging problems.\"",

      "Previous research carried out by academics at Durham University and the University of Sheffield suggests that women are more likely to experience blurred boundaries between work and family life.",
      "It found that women working remotely were more likely to value being present for their families, while men were less inclined to interrupt their work schedules to address family needs.",
      "Its researchers suggested, however, that remote work can help employees with a better work-family balance if they are well supported.",
      "\"Businesses do have a role to play in that,\" Ms Crosbie said on Tuesday.",
      "\"We just need to be careful that we don't inadvertently prevent women from taking some of the opportunities by not being in the office when they feel it's beneficial both to their skills and to contribute to the business.\""

      "James, from Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, started blogging about their lives nine years ago and now has more than a million followers on social media.",
      "Here, in his own words, James speaks about his hopes for the future for his teenage sons.",
      "'It was the hardest period of my life'",
      "When my eldest son Jude was a baby, he was slow to crawl and didn't respond to his name. He used to stare out of the window, he was quite distant and almost in a different world.",
      "His mum Charlotte, my ex-wife, first raised concerns when he was eight months old but I just thought he was a bit behind because he was premature.",
      "We went back to the doctor quite a few times before we got an autism diagnosis in 2009 when he was 18 months old.",
      "At the time, the information out there was very clinical, most things we were reading were from the NHS website and medical journals. I felt like I couldn't take it in and I had so many unanswered questions.",
      "Three years later we went through the same diagnosis with Tommy at a similar age.",
      "I knew a lot more about autism than when we had Jude, but the boys have always been so different.",
      "I didn't enjoy the first year of Tommy's life as much as I could have done because I spent so much time watching him and looking for signs.",
      "He hit certain milestones much quicker than Jude but he wouldn't make eye contact and would get easily frustrated and enjoyed playing alone.",
      "Around the same time, when Jude was four, he started having huge meltdowns and was physically hurting himself.",
      "Jude is non-speaking, so it's very difficult for him to explain what's wrong. That was the hardest period of my life.",
      "He used to wake up in the night screaming and hitting himself. Thankfully as Jude has gotten older, and we've learnt more about how to meet his needs, this has got much better.",
      "'We decided to split the boys up'",
      "Unfortunately at the time Tommy was a huge trigger for him because he was loud and unpredictable. His self-harming would scare Tommy so we used to have to keep them apart a lot.",
      "In 2016, my wife Charlotte and I sadly decided to separate. We took the incredibly difficult decision to split Jude and Tommy up and we felt guilty, like we were failing.",
      "But Jude was immediately like a different child, you could sense his anxiety going, so we knew it was the right decision.",
      "I live in an annexe at my parents' house and help care for my dad who has Parkinson's and my mum, who has dementia, though she is now in a home.",

      "You never imagine life like that. I don't know if they will ever be able to live together but they will always be part of each other's lives.",
      "I wish I could be with both of them at the same time, and I don't get much free time, but this is the best thing for them right now. It has probably made being a single parent easier for me because I'm never alone.",
      "Their school is helping them to do more fun things together like trampolining and eating lunch together.",
      "'I've just had one of my best ever days with them'",

      "There have been times he's been too anxious to do that and we were housebound but at the moment he's doing OK.",
      "Tommy is 13, and he is cheeky, mischievous, funny, and curious about everything around him. He loves looking at books and puzzles. He isn't fully verbal but he uses a communication device.",
      "I recently had one of the best days I've ever had with Jude and Tommy.",
      "In the past, when we have tried to do anything to celebrate Christmas, it has never gone well, it was too overwhelming for them. But we went to see Father Christmas and made such special memories.",
      "'I've connected with people from all over the world'",
      "Nine years ago I began sharing stories from our lives online, on a weekly blog. Then I started Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok accounts.",
      "It was initially a way to show friends and family what our life was really like. Jude and Tommy struggled with social occasions, so we stopped going.",
      "I could never find the words to explain, and I wanted to show how proud I was of them, so I started writing instead.",
      "I didn't realise how much our stories would resonate with others, or how much it would help me.",
      "I learned so much more about autism, connected with people all over the world and discovered a passion for helping other families.",
      "I've been lucky that I've been able to make a living through social media. I had to give up my previous job to be there for the boys.",
      "I started a clothing line last year, with positive messaging around autism, disabilities and neurodivergence. I love getting messages from people saying they have bumped into someone wearing one of the hoodies, and it started a conversation.",
      "I opened a shop in Burnham-on-Crouch where we stock the clothes and wrap and pack and send out the orders.",

      "I don't know what the future will look like, but I know I need to think about how to help them live as independently as they can, and prepare for the days when I'm not here.",
      "Autism has meant we've had some of the highest highs, and experienced some lows far lower than I ever knew were imaginable.",

    "summary": "Education experts have found low attainment in subjects like maths and science in Scotland this year.",
    "story": [
      "The number of Scottish pupils passing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) subjects is \"very worrying\", according to a report by education experts.",
      "The Commission on School Reform analysed exam pass rates for secondary pupils taking National 5 subjects with data going back to 2015.",
      "It said 40.1% of all fourth year pupils - typically aged 14-16 years old - had passed National 5 mathematics in 2024, while 75.2% passed English. Just over 25% passed the most popular science subject, biology.",
      "The Scottish government said that not all pupils sit National 5 exams in S4.",
      "And it pointed out that 68% of the pupils in all school years who sat Nat 5 maths in 2024 had passed, an increase of 5.7 percentage points from the previous year.",
      "The Commission on School Reform is an independent group of education experts, set up by think tank Reform Scotland.",
      "Its latest report analysed SQA exam data for the total number of pupils in S4, as well as the number who took each subject.",
      "The report said the \"real\" pass rate - for all S4 pupils - was:",
      "40.1% in mathematics25.9% in biology22.5% in chemistry17.9% in physics9.8% in computing science",
      "40.1% in mathematics",
      "25.9% in biology",
      "22.5% in chemistry",
      "17.9% in physics",
      "9.8% in computing science",
      "It said the pass rates for those in fourth year who took those subjects were: 76% for maths; 69.4% for biology; 78.7% for chemistry; 76.7% for physics and 80.9% for computing science.",
      "Former Kilmarnock Academy headteacher and member of the commission, Carole Ford, said the data laid bare that there was a \"mountain to climb\".",
      "She said the results of the international Pisa survey in 2023 had already shown that Scotland's outcomes in maths and science were \"very poor\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Ms Ford said issues like staffing could be a contributing factor to the reason for the decline in student performance, but Scotland does not collect enough data to examine the true cause.",
      "She said: \"One of the things that the Scottish government said was they felt that the drop in the number doing maths in particular was because we support a curriculum of pupil choice.",
      "\"Pupils are choosing subjects on the basis of where they are most likely to succeed and that's even more concerning because we have to ask ourselves, why do fewer pupils now expect to succeed in maths and in stem subjects?",
      "\"For society as whole, this is not good news. Society develops on the back of an educated population and not having the level of education in sciences and mathematics that other countries do will be to Scotland's disadvantage.\"",
      "'Not good enough'",
      "Chair of Reform Scotland and former Labour first minister Lord Jack McConnell said it was \"very worrying\" that less than half of Scotland's 16-year-olds had passed National 5 maths.",
      "He added:  \"If our economic future is to be based around industries like renewable energy and health sciences, improving our pass rates in mathematics and the sciences is a matter of critical national importance.",
      "\"The deficit in our Stem pass rates revealed by this research is not good enough.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Scottish government said pupils, parents and teachers at individual schools are best placed to decide at what age national qualifications are taken.",
      "They added: \"They are best-placed to determine the correct pathway for each young person and this flexibility and child-centred approach has been a key feature of Curriculum for Excellence for many years.",
      "\"One of the most important aspects of such decisions is that young people are entered at the level of qualification at which they have the best chance of achieving success.\"",
      "These figures demonstrate the way in which the senior phase in secondary schools operates.",
      "The emphasis is on what a student has achieved by the time they leave school - not what they have obtained at the end of a particular school year.",
      "The overwhelming majority of students - not just the academically able - now remain in school until S6.",
      "Some students may not obtain a National 5 qualification in maths in S4 but go on to get one in S5.",
      "Another factor is worth considering too.",
      "Once English and maths, or at least arithmetic, were effectively compulsory for students in S4.",
      "Now they are often just options, albeit relatively popular ones.",
      "This reflects how many schools only allow students to do a maximum of six National 4 or 5 courses in S4.",
      "There are several issues worthy of discussion.",
      "One is whether young people at all schools should have the chance to obtain more than 6 qualifications in S4.",
      "Another is whether certain subjects should, in effect, be mandatory as was once the case. (Until the 1980s any student with a reasonable prospect of passing was expected to do O Grade English and Maths. From the late 80s on, most would study Standard Grade courses in these subjects at the appropriate level.)",
      "If, however, compulsion is not the answer some supporters of particular subjects may want to consider if more can be done to make them attractive options which a greater number of students might positively choose."

      "It comes amid a rise in STIs in the past year: 22% in chlamydia, 127% in gonorrhoea, and 14% in syphilis.",
      "Ellie Whelan and Megan Grimley, both 21, from Cardiff, said the move away from condoms surprised them given more of their peers had turned away from the pill or coil as forms of contraception.",
      "Use of long-acting, reversible contraception - such as an intra-uterine device (IUD) or hormonal implant - has fallen 22% in the last five years, with terminations up by a third.",

      "HIV takes seven weeks to be detected, hepatitis C and B can take 12 weeks or more, and chlamydia and gonorrhoea can show up within a fortnight.",
      "But it is not solely an issue for young adults. Ms Peart said the YMCA sessions explain the range of contraception available, but at the back of most classrooms is a teacher also taking notes, as the gap in STI knowledge in particular is on \"a national, societal level\".",
      "It is also reflected in the rise in sexually transmitted infections in the over-40s, according to Public Health Wales's Zoe Couzens, as people enter new relationships after divorce or bereavement.",

      "\"And if I may say - what a day to go. He'll be celebrating New Year's Eve with a stash of great musicians in heaven. One year on from his last live show. God bless that extraordinary husband of mine who is now in a place of peace.\"",

      "\"The struggles I\u2019ve had with doing the show and trying to sort of keep up a professional standard suitable for Radio 2 has been getting more and more difficult, hence my little jokes about Puffing Billy, so I\u2019ve had to make the decision that I need to bring my career to an end.\"",

      "At the end of his final show, Walker said: \"[It's] going to be very strange not to be on the wireless anymore. Also, by the same token, life will be slightly less of a strain really, trying to find the breath in order to do the programmes.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 15:56:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The pair were married for two years - but it has taken four times that time to reach a divorce deal.",
    "story": [
      "Arguably the modern era's biggest A-list couple, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were married for two years - but it has taken eight years since announcing their divorce to finally reach a deal. Why did it take four times as long as the marriage itself to settle?",
      "One part of the answer is that it's a particularly messy divorce, complicated by  bitter legal disputes involving their children and a French vineyard they bought together.",
      "Some of that still needs to be resolved in what Jolie's lawyer has called \"a long ongoing process\".",
      "Celebrity lawyer Chris Melcher told BBC News the divorce settlement had taken an unusually long time.",
      "\"This is much longer than any divorce we typically see,\" he said.",
      "\"But they initially had fights over custody and then it revolved around this winery they own together, and that's been the focus of their fight over the last few years.\"",
      "Many celebrities want to divorce quickly and move on, Melcher explained.",
      "\"A lot of times in a case of this magnitude we can settle it within six months, a year at the very most. Eight years is really a sign of something more going on.",
      "\"It's an inability to let go and a desire to really harm the other.\"",
      "Kate Daly, co-founder of online divorce company Amicable, told the BBC that such a case was very different from an average divorce.",
      "\"It's an industry... [they can afford] lots of expensive lawyers,\" she said. \"Most people couldn't afford for it to take eight years. It's an industry and it's a bad example - we have to distance [normal] people from that kind of narrative.\"",
      "Romantic beginning",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, got together after meeting on the set of the film Mr & Mrs Smith, which was released in 2005.",
      "\"Because of the film, we ended up being brought together to do all these crazy things, and I think we found this strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly happened,\" Jolie told Vogue in 2007.",
      "Both had been married before - Pitt to Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie to actors Jonny Lee Miller (1996 to 2000) and Billy Bob Thornton (2000 to 2003).",
      "Jolie and Pitt share six children together.",
      "Jolie adopted Maddox from Cambodia in 2002 a few months after he was born. Pitt later adopted him after he and Jolie had begun their relationship.",
      "In 2005, the pair adopted daughter Zahara from Ethiopia when she was a few months old.",
      "The couple's first biological child, Shiloh, was born in Namibia in 2006. Earlier this year, it was reported that Shiloh had submitted a petition to a court to drop Pitt from her name.",
      "Their son Pax was adopted at the age of three from Vietnam in 2007, and twins Knox and Vivienne were born in 2008.",
      "Beginning of the end",
      "The couple made their final red carpet appearance together in November 2015 for a film they both starred in, By the Sea. It was about an unhappily married couple, and was written and directed by Jolie.",
      "The couple rarely discussed their relationship but when promoting the film, Jolie told The Telegraph: \"Brad and I have our issues.",
      "\"We have fights and problems like any other couple. We have days when we drive each other absolutely mad and want space, but the problems in the movie aren't our specific problems.\"",
      "The news that Jolie was filing for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\", came as a shock to many in September 2016.",
      "'Vitriolic hatred'",
      "It emerged that she filed for divorce a day after an incident on board a private plane.",
      "Pitt was initially alleged to have hit son Maddox, then 15, on the flight from France to Los Angeles. The FBI and social workers examined the claims, but neither took any action. Pitt denied wrongdoing.",
      "Then in 2022, legal papers from the vineyard dispute revealed that Jolie accused Pitt of drunkenly attacking her and two children during the flight.",
      "At the time, a source close to the actor told the BBC that her claims were false.",
      "Speaking to Vogue in 2020, Jolie said she left Pitt for the \"wellbeing\" of her family.",
      "\"It was the right decision,\" she said. \"I continue to focus on their healing.\"",
      "In an interview with GQ in 2017, Pitt spoke about his decision to quit drinking and smoking marijuana, saying the split had been a \"huge generator for change\".",
      "Regarding the divorce, Pitt said he and Jolie had decided to abandon a path of \"vitriolic hatred\" and work together to sort out their issues, adding that they were committed to resolving matters amicably and privately.",
      "Custody battle",
      "Their attempts to reach agreements over the divorce and custody of their children appeared to be acrimonious and protracted.",
      "In 2019, a judge declared that the couple were officially single, but that the divorce still needed to be finalised.",
      "They reached a custody deal in 2018, but that appeared to fall apart. In 2021, Pitt was granted joint custody after a court battle, but the private judge who oversaw the case was later removed because he did not disclose his business relationships with Pitt's lawyers.",
      "That raised the prospect of a fresh custody case, but nothing has been made public.",
      "And while the divorce saga may now be drawing to a close, there is another legal battle still ongoing - to do with the vineyard.",
      "Pitt and Jolie bought Chateau Miraval together in 2008 and got married in its small chapel in 2014.",
      "But Jolie sold her share to a spirits manufacturer owned by a Russian oligarch, according to Pitt's lawsuit. He is suing his ex-wife for selling her stake in the estate, saying they agreed not to sell their shares without the permission of the other. Jolie has not publicly commented.",
      "Emotional fallout",
      "Few details of the divorce proceedings have been revealed. Private judges are often hired in the US to mediate disputes between divorcing celebrities for privacy reasons.",
      "Their children are now all aged between 16 and 23, and showbiz journalist Jeanne Wolf emphasised the emotional fallout.",
      "\"It's been a very emotional and complicated divorce settlement. It's taken a big toll on the children and the couple involved,\" she said.",
      "\"They have tried very hard not to let too many details known about what went on in that marriage.\"",
      "Jolie's lawyer highlighted the passage of time in his statement on Monday. \"This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago,\" he said.",

      "\"It was over Christmas last year, we were at home, and just seeing the numbers going crazy for people interacting with the song on streaming and TikTok,\" she says, remembering when she first noticed something unusual was happening with a song that was more than 20 years old.",
      "On 22 December 2023, Saltburn was released on Amazon Prime. By 5 January 2024, Murder on the Dancefloor was back in the top 10 and would spend five weeks at number two, only kept off the top spot by Noah Kahan's Stick Season.",
      "\"The year started with an old friend Murder on the Dancefloor taking me for another twirl,\" is how she sums it up.",
      "\"To be honest, at that time it was all quite abstract, and I think this year has been about turning it into an actuality.\"",
      "US success",
      "In 2024, at the age of 45, Ellis-Bextor had her debut hit single on the Billboard Top 100, made her live US TV debut as the musical guest on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and embarked on her first ever headlining tour of the States.",
      "Murder on the Dancefloor was also her ticket to singing at the Bafta Film Awards, making a guest appearance during the DJ Peggy Gou's headlining set on the Park stage at Glastonbury, and even performing in front of King Charles at the Royal Variety Show.",

      "Last year more than seven million people were watching as Rick Astley handed over to Big Ben.",
      "Ellis-Bextor says that for the last two months, and whilst on tour supporting the Human League, she has been using down time to plan extensively for the show, with her husband and musical director, Richard Jones, who is also the bass player for The Feeling.",
      "\"New Year's Eve is such a big deal, and I don't take it lightly if people are choosing to spend it with us,\" she confides.",
      "\"So, I want to make sure we try and create the ultimate New Year's Eve party. I just want to give this last boost of escapist fun. I mean, look at how many disco balls we've got here. We've got them all. A monopoly.\"",

      "And 2025 will, of course, start with Murder on the Dancefloor, \"but after a little bit of Auld Lang Syne,\" she clarifies.",
      "To make the show even more special, Ellis-Bextor has enlisted some of her musical mates.",
      "\"I've got Jake Shears from Scissor Sisters,\" she confirms with relish.",
      "\"Their album came out not too long after my first album, so we used to do a lot of stuff together. We've had some nights out, but it's actually the first time we've sung together.\"",
      "They will be duetting on two of Scissor Sisters' best-known tracks, including Take Your Mama, which will feature what Ellis-Bexter describes as \"an epic guitar solo\" by Emily Roberts, from the Brit-winning group The Last Dinner Party.",
      "\"I'm a massive fan of their band,\" she says, having covered their song Nothing Matters for the Radio One Live Lounge back in February.",
      "Indeed, indie music is where Ellis-Bexter started out. She first made the charts in 1998 as lead singer of theaudience, a band who made up for their lack of capital letters and use of the space bar with a couple of rather catchy Smiths influenced post-Britpop top 40 hits.",

      "Twenty-one of those weeks belonged to Sabrina Carpenter, whose hit singles Espresso, Taste and Please, Please, Please dominated the second half of the year.",
      "Women were also responsible for half of the year's biggest-selling albums, with Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department leading the pack.",
      "A break-up album full of caustic kiss-offs and sober reflection, it accumulated more than 783,000 sales by the end of December - more than any artist has managed in a calendar year since Ed Sheeran's \u00f7 sold 2.7 million copies in 2017.",

      "CVT stands for cerebral venous thrombosis.",
      "\"It's so important to identify early because it's treatable,\" Gadot continued. \"While rare, it's a possibility, and knowing it exists is the first step to addressing it.",
      "\"Sharing this is not meant to frighten anyone but to empower. If even one person feels compelled to take action for their health because of this story, it will have been worth sharing.\"",
      "A blood clot is rare in pregnancy, but the slowing of blood flow during pregnancy and just after giving birth increases the risk.",
      "A 2020 study published in the journal Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders said one adult per 100,000 is diagnosed with CVT every year - rising to three per 100,000 among women aged between 31 and 50.",
      "The study suggested there are a number of factors for the increase, mainly the use of oral contraceptives, but being heavily pregnant or being within six weeks after giving birth are also possible factors (between 5% and 20% of cases).",
      "Pregnancy also increases the risk of other forms of clots such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), usually in the legs, and pulmonary embolism, when part of a clot travels to the lungs."

So if she marries somebody who is of a different religion or of a different caste, that becomes an issue. For me, it is really a method to control women and infantilise them,\" she says.",
      "Talati's Girls Will Be Girls explores female adolescence, rebellion and intergenerational conflict through the story of a 16-year-old girl studying at a strict boarding school in the Himalayas and her fractured relationship with her mother, Anila, who struggles with her own vulnerabilities and unresolved emotions.",
      "\"It is the kind of coming-of-age film that we don't do in India at all,\" Gupta says. \"It looks at women from a very empathetic, very warm gaze.\"",
      "\"The age where people experience emotions with and without their bodies, their minds, that exploration but without infantilising the experience - it was never part of Indian mainstream cinema,\" she adds.",
      "Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies did not perform well at the box-office but got warm reviews from viewers and critics. At a BAFTA screening in London this month, Ms Rao described the current moment as \"really special for women from India\", expressing hope for a continued wave of such stories.",
      "Her film is a satirical comedy about two newlywed brides getting accidentally swapped on a train because of their veils. It offers a sharp commentary on patriarchy, identity and gender roles, a shift from decades of male-centred mainstream Indian films.",
      "\"A lot of us who are very patriarchal in our thinking are often that way because that's how we have been brought up,\" Bollywood star Aamir Khan, a co-producer of the film, said after the screening. \"But we need to be understanding, at least try and help each other even to come out of this kind of thinking.\"",
      "The biggest surprise this year came from the UK, which selected the Hindi-language film Santosh, directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri, as its Oscar entry. Shot entirely in India over a 44-day schedule, it featured a largely female crew. Starring Indian actors Shahana Goswami and Sunita Rajbhar, Santosh was co-produced by people and companies across the UK, India, Germany and France.",
      "The film is intrinsically an Indian story about violence against women, set as a taut thriller.",
      "Goswami says the success of Santosh and All We Imagine as Light points to the merging of borders and expansion of film industries, creating space for cross-pollination and exchange.",
      "\"We often think these Indian films require [specific] cultural context, but they don't. Any film driven by emotion will resonate universally, regardless of its origins,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Three of the films - All We Imagine as Light, Girls Will Be Girls and Santosh - share one more common trait: they are cross-country co-productions.",
      "Goswami agrees that this could this be a formula for the future.",
      "\"With a French producer, for example, a film gains the opportunity to be seen by a French audience who may follow that producer or the broader film industry. This is how it becomes more globally accessible and relevant,\" she says.",
      "Even in Bollywood, some women-led films have had huge success this year. Stree 2, a horror-comedy about a mysterious woman battling a monster who abducts free-thinking women, was the year's second-biggest hit, playing in cinemas for months.",
      "On streaming platforms, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's opulent Netflix series Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, an exploration of the misogyny and exploitation in the lives of courtesans in pre-independent India, was among Google's top-searched TV shows of the year.",
      "Their success seems to signal a growing appetite for such stories, their broad appeal demonstrating that mainstream cinema can address important themes without sacrificing entertainment value.",
      "Despite systemic challenges, 2024 has highlighted the global power of female voices from India and the demand for diverse stories. The momentum could be crucial for the Indian film industry in getting wider distribution for its independent films and pave the way for a more diverse and equitable film landscape."

    "summary": "He was one of radio's 60s rebels.  More than 50 years later, after many ups and downs he was still broadcasting as the BBC's 'Sounds of the 70s'.",
    "story": [
      "Johnnie Walker's long radio career was shaped by his early years as a pirate broadcaster in the 1960s, bobbing around on the ocean on Radio Caroline.",
      "Even 50 years later, his wife Tiggy would refer to him as \"the pirate\".",
      "It remained more than apt, given that his subsequent time on mainstream radio was marked by more than a few battles with the bosses.",
      "Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker dies at the age of 79",
      "Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker dies at the age of 79",
      "Rebel spirit",
      "His DJ career began at the age of 21, when he was first given a chance to play records on 'Swinging' Radio England, a boat moored four miles off the Essex coast.",
      "In return, they asked that he change his name - from Peter Dingley to the rather more rock 'n' roll-sounding Johnnie Walker.",
      "The boat was one of a number of floating stations that had taken advantage of a loophole in the law that allowed them to get round the BBC's monopoly on the UK airwaves to bring the sound of 60s pop to the nation's radios - something the BBC had up to that point largely resisted.",
      "Walker took to the rebel spirit. His years at public school had fostered a loathing of authority, and he had gone out of his way to fail his O-levels. Radio allowed him to embrace his passion - music - especially the rock, soul and underground sounds that were not making it to the top of the singles chart.",
      "Occasionally, he would row across to another boat, Radio London, to chat to a kindred spirit, a young DJ who was beginning to make a name for himself, John Peel.",
      "It wasn't tea he was talking about",
      "Walker then moved to the pirate mothership, Radio Caroline.",
      "His style was laid back, conversational and a contrast to the highly formatted slick patter of many other DJs.",
      "That attitude may have had something to do with his favoured means of relaxation on board. He even had an on-air code - he said the boat was running short of tea to signal that they were running out of his preferred type of herbal cigarette.",
      "His time on board also coincided with the government\u2019s decision to crack down on the pirates. Walker was on air at midnight of 14 August 1967, when the law making the pirates illegal came in to force.",
      "He read out a defiant speech declaring: \"We belong to you and we love you.\" His reputation as a symbol of the spirit of the pirates was assured.",
      "Undone by the Bay City Rollers",
      "However, in 1969 he switched sides and joined the establishment, BBC Radio One. It was not the easiest of relationships.",
      "He was, he said, accused of being \"too into the music\". He would pepper his shows with album tracks and songs outside the approved playlist.",
      "When he championed Walk on the Wild Side, Lou Reed\u2019s song about sex, drugs and transgender bohemia, his BBC boss had questions. It only stayed on the playlist because they had never encountered the phrase \"giving head\".",
      "Walker also loved Bruce Springsteen and the Eagles; Chirpy, Chirpy Cheep, Cheep, not so much.",
      "The cheery, cheeky sound of 70s mainstream radio was not his thing. At one Radio One event, he and Peel remembered watching, stunned, as fans of the Bay City Rollers brought chaos.",
      "\"Bay City Roller fans were jumping into the lake to be near their idols who were in a boat. John Peel turned to me and said, 'Johnnie, take note, this is one of the most bizarre sights you will ever see'.",
      "\"And then speeding into view came Tony Blackburn in another boat, being steered by a Womble.\"",
      "Cocaine, court and punk rock",
      "Not long after that, he parted company with Radio One after describing the Bay City Rollers as \"musical garbage\". He decided to leave for the freedom of US radio. It had its ups and downs.",
      "KSAN in San Francisco, with its relaxed FM rock playlist, seemed a perfect match until punk came along. It was not to the manager's taste and Walker was soon looking for work elsewhere.",
      "His sideline of sending pre-recorded shows back to Radio Luxembourg also came to an end when he played a record at the wrong speed.",
      "By the early 80s, he was back in the UK and on the dole.",
      "His return to the airwaves included a spell in independent local radio before he returned to the BBC. He again came a cropper at BBC GLR after saying there would be dancing in the streets when Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister in 1991.",
      "But, despite the setbacks, he eventually found a home at Radio 2.",
      "However, that almost came to an end when the News of the World's infamous fake sheikh staged a sting in 1999 and got him to reveal his drug habit. It was, he said, his lowest point. But after a trip to rehab, a \u00a32,000 fine and a promise that he had changed his ways, he was allowed back on to Radio 2.",
      "And that is where he stayed. He was even awarded an MBE.",
      "Sounds of the 70s",
      "The music that had been frowned on by the bosses in the 70s was now classic rock and he had a loyal fanbase who recognised him as one of their own.",
      "Being \"too into the music\" had paid off, he was now the authentic voice of the Sounds of the 70s.",
      "He presented the show of that name, and Radio 2's Rock Show, until health problems forced him to retire in October, after 58 years on the air.",

      "What happened on the day he died?",
      "Payne had been staying in the upmarket Casa Sur hotel for three days before his death.",
      "Payne's friend Roger Nores was at the hotel with him but left at 16:11 local time (20:11 BST) on 16 October, Argentine prosecutors have said.",
      "Payne was then in the hotel lobby and was unable to stand \"due to the consumption of various substances\", they said.",
      "At 16:54, cameras recorded him being dragged unconscious by three people - led by chief receptionist Esteban Grassi - and taken to his room, according to prosecutors.",
      "Grassi called emergency services at about 17:00, with requests to respond to a hotel guest \"who is overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol\" and \"destroying his room\".",

      "It is thought he fell from the balcony at about 17:07 local time.",
      "Police arrived minutes later. Hotel staff told them a loud sound had been heard in the courtyard, where Payne's body was discovered.",
      "He was pronounced dead at the scene, with the emergency services saying there had been \"no possibility of resuscitation\".",
      "Police say they found his room in \"total disorder\". Local media later published pictures purportedly from his room, showing a TV with a broken screen, multiple bottles, cans, candles, aluminium foil and a half-full glass of champagne.",

      "An autopsy, which was carried out that evening, established that Payne suffered \"multiple traumas\" and \"internal and external haemorrhaging\", with 25 injuries that were \"consistent with a fall from a great height\".",
      "On 7 November, the prosecutor's office said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his body.",
      "They also ruled out self-harm or physical intervention by a third party.",
      "They said Payne didn't adopt a posture to protect himself from the fall. That, along with other information, led them to conclude he was unconscious or semi-conscious when he fell.",
      "They ruled out \"a conscious or voluntary act\", saying he didn't know what he was doing or didn't understand it.",
      "However, following a further forensic report and an inspection of the scene on 5 December, a judge said that, in his state of intoxication, Payne \"tried to leave the room through the balcony\" and fell to his death.",

      "It's due to land in autumn, 12 years after predecessor GTA 5 arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, breaking launch records.",
      "The sequel already broke records with its first trailer, which racked up an astonishing 90 million views in 24 hours when it debuted last December.",
      "And that probably won't be the last record that will be broken.",
      "\"The anticipation for this is impossible to measure,\" says James Batchelor, editor-in-chief of GamesIndustry.biz.",
      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",
      "The big question on most fans' minds is whether the release date will slip, as has happened for previous big releases from Rockstar.",
      "James says he's seen nothing to suggest that it will - yet - but if things stay quiet it's time to start worrying.",
      "\"If we still have seen absolutely nothing by summer, and certainly if we've seen nothing of it by, say, end of August, then yeah, that's going to 2026,\" he says.",

      "The release of GTA 6 is expected to have an impact on the wider games industry.",
      "\"I think it will probably be one of those moments where the rising tide is going to lift all of the boats,\" says George Osborn, consultant and author of the Video Games Industry Memo newsletter.",
      "He says a big hit - especially one with the cultural resonance of GTA - can get more people \"in the mood to buy video games\" and publishers want to capitalise on that.",
      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",
      "Many gamers are still sticking with their previous-generation machines, and Sony and Microsoft will be hoping GTA 6 will finally inspire them to upgrade.",
      "\"If anything is going to convince people to jump to a new console if they haven't already it's going to be GTA 6,\" says James, who estimates that PlayStation 4 users still count for 50% of Sony's active players.",

      "Despite unconfirmed leaks and rumours the machine's capabilities remain a mystery and the company's promised some sort of official announcement by the end of March.",
      "There's a feeling, though, that Nintendo won't want to change the winning formula of the original Switch, which has sold 146 million units since its 2017 launch.",
      "\"The sensible money is on just a bigger, better Switch,\" says James.",
      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",
      "But James isn't sure it will experience the same fate.",

      "\"On the triple-A side a lot of critics and players have said 'it's such a quiet year, there's not many big releases', but for indie games, there's always so many cool things to play.\"",
      "A success like Balatro is incredibly rare, and one of the big issues for indie developers in 2024 has been discoverability - getting players to actually find your game.",
      "Rachel says the number of releases on Steam - the online store where most PC games are bought - is \"frankly bonkers\" and getting noticed is \"one of the most difficult things\".",
      "\"I just don't see that becoming any easier,\" she says.",
      "Rachel says indie developers are also struggling to find investment and the financial outlook is \"pretty bleak\" going into 2025.",
      "But she does think that more gamers are starting to recognise the creativity that exists in the sector - and more breakout hits will follow.",
      "\"The indie space is a place where I retreat to just play games that get me excited about gaming again,\" says Rachel.",

      "Last month, after 53-year-old poet and novelist Han Kang won the Nobel Prize for her literature, online boards were full of memes noting South Korea\u2019s \u201cCulture Victory\u201d \u2014 a reference to the popular video game series Civilisation.",
      "And there were jokes about how the country had achieved the dream of founding father Kim Koo, who famously wrote that he wished for Korea to be a nation of culture rather than might.",
      "As it turns out, this moment had been in the making for years.",
      "It's all in the timing",
      "After South Korea\u2019s military dictatorship ended in 1987, censorship was loosened and numerous TV channels launched. Soon, there was a generation of creators who had grown up idolising Hollywood and hip-hop, says Hye Seung Chung, associate professor of Korean Film Studies at the University of Buffalo.",
      "Around the same time, South Korea rapidly grew rich, benefitting from an export boom in cars and electronics. And money from conglomerates, or chaebols as they are known, flowed into film and TV production, giving it a Hollywood-like sheen.",
      "They came to own much of the industry, from production to cinemas. So they were willing to splurge on making movies without worrying much about losses, Prof Chung says.",
      "K-pop, meanwhile, had become a domestic rage in the mid-90s, propelling the success of groups such as HOT and Shinhwa.",
      "This inspired agencies to replicate the gruelling Japanese artist management system.",
      "Scout young talent, often in their teens, and sign them onto years-long contracts through which they become \u201cperfect\u201d idols, with squeaky clean images and hyper-managed public personas. As the system took hold, it transformed K-pop, creating more and more idols.",
      "By the 2000s, Korean TV shows and K-pop were a hit in East and South East Asia. But it was streaming that took them to the world, and into the lives of anyone with a smartphone.",
      "That\u2019s when the recommendation engine took over \u2013 it has been key in initiating Korean culture fans, taking them from one show to the next, spanning different genres and even platforms.",
      "The alien and the familiar",
      "Evan says he binged the 16 hour-long episodes of Full House. He loved the way it took its time to build the romance, from bickering banter to attraction, unlike the American shows he knew.",
      "\u201cI was fascinated by each cultural difference I saw - I noticed that they don\u2019t wear shoes in the house,\u201d he recalls. So he took up Netflix\u2019s suggestions for more Korean romcoms. Soon, he found himself humming to the soundtracks of the shows, and was drawn to K-pop.",
      "He has now begun watching variety shows, a reality TV genre where comedians go through a series of challenges together.",
      "As they work their way through the recommendations, fans are immersed in a world that feels foreign yet familiar \u2013 one that eventually includes kimchi jiggae, a spicy kimchi stew, and kalguksu, a seafood and kelp noodle broth.",
      "When Mary Gedda first visited South Korea, she went looking for a bowl of kimchi jjigae, as she had seen the stars do on screen numerous times.",
      "\u201cI was crying [as I ate it]. It was so spicy,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, why did I order this? They eat it so easily in every show.\u201d",
      "Mary, an aspiring French actor, now lives in Seoul. Originally a K-pop fan, she then discovered K-dramas and learned Korean. She has starred in a few cameo roles as well. \u201cI got lucky and I absolutely love it,\u201d she says.",
      "For Mary, food was a big part of the appeal because she saw such a variety of it on K-dramas. Seeing how characters build relationships over food was familiar to her, she says, because she grew up in the French countryside in Burgundy.",
      "But there is also the promise of romance, which drew Marie Namur to South Korea from her native Belgium. She began watching K-dramas on a whim, after visiting South Korea, but she says she kept going because she was \u201cpretty much attracted to all those beautiful Korean men\u201d.",
      "\"[They] are impossible love stories between a super-rich guy and a girl who is usually poor, and, you know, the guy is there to save her and it really sells you a dream.\"",
      "But it is Korean women who are writing most of these shows \u2013 so it is their imagination, or fantasy, that is capturing the interest (and hearts) of other women across the world.",
      "In Seoul, Marie said she was \u201ctreated like a lady\u201d, which hadn\u2019t happened \u201cin a very long time\u201d, but her \u201cdating experience is not exactly as I expected it to be\u201d.",
      "\u201cI do not want to be a housewife. I want to keep working. I want to be free. I want to go clubbing with my girlfriends if I want to, even though I'm married or in a relationship, and a lot of guys here do not want that.\u201d",
      "International fans are often looking for an alternative world because of disappointment with their own society, Prof Chung says.",
      "The prim romances, with handsome, caring and chivalrous heroes, are drawing a female audience turning away from what they see as hypersexual American entertainment. And when social inequality became a stronger theme in Korean films and shows - such as Parasite and Squid Game \u2013 it attracted global viewers disillusioned with capitalism and a yawning wealth divide in their countries.",
      "The pursuit of a global audience has brought challenges as well. The increasing use of English lyrics in K-pop has led to some criticism.",
      "And there is now a bigger spotlight on the industry's less glamorous side. The immense pressure stars face to be perfect, for instance, and the demands of a hyper-competitive industry. Creators behind blockbuster shows have alleged exploitation and complained about not being fairly compensated.",
      "Still, it\u2019s great to see the world pay attention to Korea, Prof Chung says. She grew up in a repressive South Korea, when critics of the government were regularly threatened or even killed. She escaped into American movies.",
      "When Parasite played in the cinema of the small American town where she lives, she saw on the faces of other moviegoers the same awe she felt as a child watching Hollywood films: \u201cIt feels so great that our love is returned.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 00:11:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Dynamic pricing, Katy Perry's comeback album, Joker 2 and Eurovision were among the biggest fails of 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Money, success, power, beauty - it often seems as if celebrities have everything they could possibly want.",
      "So it's just as well they also get tangled up in their fair share of mishaps, blunders and own goals every year.",
      "Here's a light-hearted look at some of 2024's biggest flops and fails.",
      "1. Katy Perry's comeback",
      "It was supposed to be a triumphant return, but critics and fans complained Katy Perry's latest album 143 sounded dated and showed little artistic growth.",
      "The music video for Woman's World, which saw Perry join a group of dancers wearing tiny outfits on a construction site, was criticised for being regressive, although Perry later said it was supposed to be satirical.",
      "Matters were only made worse when the singer attracted the attention of the Spanish government for shooting the video for follow-up single Lifetimes in ecologically-sensitive sand dunes in the Balearic Islands.",
      "But many fans defended the album, which wasn't as bad as some reviews made out, and Perry's accompanying tour has been a huge success.",
      "2. Joker bombing at the box office",
      "Making a sequel to 2019's Joker, which grossed more than $1bn (\u00a3790m), was something Hollywood found simply irresistible.",
      "Unfortunately, the resulting film, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, was something audiences found entirely resistible.",
      "Making the film a musical was a bold swing, but the tonal handbrake turn alienated the fans and critics who adored the Oscar-winning original.",
      "Folie \u00e0 Deux managed to scrape over the $200m (\u00a3158m) mark, but that was barely enough to cover its production budget, let alone marketing costs.",
      "It wasn't the only movie flop of the year - audiences were also unenthusiastic about Madame Web, The Fall Guy, Kraven the Hunter, Megalopolis, Borderlands, Argylle, Unstoppable and Furiosa: A Mad Max Story.",
      "3. Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing",
      "Ticketmaster attracted a storm of controversy after making use of so-called \"dynamic pricing\" for UK dates on the Oasis reunion tour, which raised the cost of a ticket by \u00a3200 due to the predictable demand.",
      "Charging fans \u00a3350 per ticket was a dubious PR move for a band famous for their working class roots, and the Gallagher brothers wisely distanced themselves from the strategy.",
      "But Ticketmaster argued prices are set by artists and promoters. Dynamic pricing was later ditched for the band's US tour dates.",
      "Many fans who did get close to the front of the queue for UK tickets complained they were kicked out after being wrongly identified as bots.",
      "Meanwhile, 50,000 fans who'd paid inflated prices on secondary platforms in order to secure tickets faced having them cancelled. A total omnishambles for everyone involved.",
      "4. The ruined surprise party",
      "When BBC weather presenter Kawser Quamer was asked in February about her plans for the weekend, she cheerfully explained she was attending her niece's surprise birthday party.",
      "Host Annabel Tiffin said that all sounded very lovely, but presumably the party was no longer a surprise, having just been announced on live TV. \"Oh goodness me,\" replied an alarmed Quamer, \"I've spoiled the surprise!\"",
      "The glorious mishap made its way across the Atlantic, going viral and featuring on Jimmy Kimmel Live.",
      "But Quamer handled it beautifully, and even managed to convince her niece she was talking about a different relative, keeping the surprise element intact.",
      "5. Kaos",
      "Chaos is a term which could be applied to a lot of entries in this list, but one of the biggest casualties of the year was Kaos itself.",
      "Just a month after the first series of Jeff Goldblum's Greek mythology drama was released, Netflix announced it would not return for a second.",
      "Streamers can tell quickly if something is a hit or not by measuring viewing figures and completion rates. Their data even gives them the prospective ratings of the following months based on the first.",
      "But although fans campaigned for its return, ultimately Kaos was Kancelled.",
      "6. The Co-op Live Arena",
      "Manchester's hottest new live venue finally opened this year, but only after several attempts. There was a string of cancellations due to various technical problems, including a ventilation unit falling from the ceiling.",
      "Shows by Peter Kay, Olivia Rodrigo, Take That and others were cancelled or moved, before the venue finally opened with a successful concert from rock band Elbow.",
      "The problems did at least bring one delightful moment: A Radio 4 newsreader announcing the delay of a gig by US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie.",
      "7. Joe Biden's debate performance",
      "Flops don't come much bigger than a debate performance which was so poor, it brought down an entire presidential campaign.",
      "Joe Biden seemed distant and frail when he took part in a televised live debate in June, struggling to finish some of his sentences and keep pace with Donald Trump.",
      "Biden tried to stay in the race, but the pressure on him became too high as figures including Democrat fundraiser George Clooney publicly called for him to stand down, leading to Kamala Harris replacing him as the candidate.",
      "8. The Olympics opening ceremony",
      "A barnstorming performance from Celine Dion sadly wasn't enough to rescue this soggy croissant of an opening ceremony, which was badly hampered by rain.",
      "Organisers took the event outside of the traditional stadium setting and had performers spread out across Paris instead, which was both a security nightmare and challenging for spectators.",
      "The spread meant things felt somewhat disjointed and it was hard for the ceremony to build any momentum.",
      "Meanwhile, some viewers were upset by a scene involving drag queens which many interpreted as an interpretation of the Last Supper, but artistic director Thomas Jolly said was a reference to pagan gods.",
      "9. The unofficial Bridgerton ball",
      "Hot on the heels of the disastrous Willy Wonka experience was an unofficial Bridgerton ball, where fans of the Netflix series were invited to dress up and \"step into the enchanting world of the Regency era\".",
      "Unfortunately, they were greeted with disappointing food and drab decor, with one violinist and a pole dancer for entertainment. Creators blamed \"organisational challenges\" and said they \"sincerely apologised\".",
      "We anticipate the event being eviscerated in Lady Whistledown's next newsletter.",
      "10. Eurovision. The whole thing.",
      "This year's Eurovision Song Contest was, frankly, a disaster from start to finish.",
      "A row about Israel's participation prompted security concerns, put all the entrants in an awkward position and even led to the head of Eurovision being booed during the grand final.",
      "Dutch singer Joost Klein was disqualified at the last minute due to a backstage incident involving a female camera operator who accused him of \"threatening\" behaviour. The Swedish prosecution authority said it could not prove that Klein \"had any such intention\".",
      "Winner Nemo even accidentally broke the Eurovision trophy after placing it on stage, leaving the Swiss entrant with bandages after sustaining deep cuts to the thumb.",
      "Host city Malmo said they would refuse to stage the event again if Sweden won, saying they wouldn't have the \"strength and stamina\".",
      "And to top it all off, the UK languished in 18th place.",
      "11. Broadcasting blunders",
      "Laura Kuenssberg withdrew from an interview with Boris Johnson in October after mistakenly sending her briefing notes to the former prime minister himself, resulting in what she called a few \"red faces\".",
      "ITV took over and Johnson later told 5 Live's Matt Chorley his originally scheduled interview had \"blown up on the launch pad\".",
      "Elsewhere, thousands of viewers complained to Ofcom in August when Home Secretary Yvette Cooper was interviewed on Good Morning Britain by her own husband, Ed Balls, about the violent unrest in parts of the UK.",
      "ITV's chief executive later noted it was a fluid news morning and the team had short notice that Cooper was coming on. She said the interview was impartial and fair but it wouldn't happen again.",
      "Another daytime presenter, Lorraine Kelly, became the subject of a viral X account which monitored her show attendance throughout the year (hovering just below 60%, if you're interested).",
      "Over on Strictly Come Dancing, which had already had a fairly appalling year before this series even started, fans were puzzled by some unusual on-screen encounters between singer Wynne Evans and his partner Katya Jones.",
      "Viewers spotted Jones apparently refusing to high-five Evans, and later moving his hand away from her waist.",
      "The show's welfare team checked in on them after concerns were raised, but the pair apologised for what they said was actually just a \"very silly inside joke\" between them.",
      "12. The Oppenheimer stage invasion",
      "When Oppenheimer was named best film at February's Baftas, the prize was collected by actor Cillian Murphy, director Christopher Nolan, producer Emma Thomas... and a random man standing silently in the background.",
      "The intruder was actually YouTuber Lizwani, who managed to infiltrate the event and make it all the way to the stage during the night's biggest moment.",
      "But the fact he was standing quietly and respectfully meant few viewers even noticed anything was wrong. Bafta have since tightened security.",
      "A month later, there was more awkwardness when Oppenheimer was named best picture at the Oscars, in an announcement fumbled by Al Pacino.",
      "Pacino dispensed with the traditional \"And the Oscar goes to...\"",
      "Instead, he stumbled through proceedings before announcing somewhat abruptly: \"My eyes see Oppenheimer.\"",
      "There was a delayed reaction from the audience and orchestra, who weren't entirely sure if Pacino was finished or if they had heard the winner correctly.",
      "But Scarface redeemed himself later in the year by revealing his delightful Shrek phone cover, courtesy of his young daughter. All was forgiven.",
      "13. Cynthia Erivo's poster reaction",
      "When one fan affectionately edited a promotional poster for Wicked to resemble the musical's original Broadway illustration, actress Cynthia Erivo said it erased her contribution to the film, because her eyes were hidden under her witch's hat.",
      "A barrage of memes followed as fans lightly poked fun at her reaction, with many social media users jokingly trying to avoid any further erasure by attaching pictures of Erivo to posts which had nothing to do with her.",
      "The original fan clarified that the altered film promo was intended to be \"an innocent fan edit to pay homage to the original Broadway poster\".",
      "But Erivo handled the backlash like a pro, making light of the situation and telling ET: \u201cFor me it was just like a human moment of wanting to protect little Elphaba. I probably should have called my friends.\"",
      "14. Rishi in the rain",
      "When Rishi Sunak called a general election in May, the then-prime minister made the announcement outdoors despite it bucketing with rain.",
      "Being in the open air also allowed an anti-Tory activist to disrupt the announcement by blasting music from a nearby speaker.",
      "But Sunak gamely stuck it out, later commenting that he was \"not a fair-weather politician\" and confirming he'd be taking an umbrella on the campaign trail.",
      "15. Tour troubles",
      "Live tours and concerts were disrupted this year for all kinds of reasons.",
      "Jennifer Lopez cancelled her live shows after reports of poor ticket sales, although she said it was so she could spend time with family and friends.",
      "Tenacious D's tour fell apart after one member made some ill-advised comments about Donald Trump.",
      "And Madonna's fans became increasingly frustrated with her lateness.",
      "Elsewhere, Adele repeatedly swore at an audience member in Las Vegas who she thought had shouted \"Pride sucks\". It transpired the fan had actually shouted \"work sucks\" after the singer discussed her working week. Oops.",
      "So fair play to Kate Nash for not only keeping her show on the road, but funding her tour by selling pictures of her bottom online, helpfully bringing publicity to the issues of high tour costs and poor streaming royalties in the process.",

      "Coronation Street's longstanding, long-suffering character Gail said farewell to Weatherfield on Christmas Day, after 50 years on the cobbles.",
      "Actress Helen Worth has stuck with the character through thick and thin since 1974, and fans have seen Gail weather many domestic dramas, romances, bust-ups and even prison.",
      "The ITV soap announced in June that she would depart with \"a major storyline for the Platt family\", and her exit was a typically eventful affair.",
      "The 73-year-old actress has said she felt \"truly blessed\" about her long Corrie career.",
      "Here's a look back at seven of the much-loved character's most memorable moments.",
      "**Spoiler alert** This article contains details of the Christmas episodes",
      "1. Marrying Brian, not once but twice",
      "In her penultimate episode on Tuesday, Gail was seen looking troubled on the eve of her seventh wedding - this time to Jesse Chadwick, with whom she is set to move to France.",
      "And on Christmas Day, she equalled the record as the Street's most married character, alongside Street Cars stud Steve McDonald.",
      "Viewers might recall that in 1979, Gail Potter (bonus points if you remembered her maiden name) married Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten) for the first time.",
      "Brian divorced her following her affair with Ian Latimer because he wasn't sure whether he was really the father of their daughter, Sarah.",
      "The couple reuntied and remarried in 1988, but it didn't end happily. Brian died after being stabbed in an alley after a night out.",
      "2. Coming to terms with teenage pregnancy",
      "In 2000, Gail was shocked to receive the news that Sarah (Tina O'Brien) was pregnant at the age of 13.",
      "She'd taken the teenager to the doctor simply for being sick and not eating, before the baby bombshell was dropped.",
      "\"You can't be pregnant if you've not had sex,\" declared Gail to her tearful daughter.",
      "Shock slowly spread across Gail's face as the reality dawned on her.",
      "Recalling how she felt at the time as a young actress, O'Brien this week told BBC News that Worth \"literally held my hand throughout\" the experence.",
      "\"We were expected to do press [interviews] and I was quite a young girl and quite self-conscious and shy, and she was just so kind and wonderful with me.\"",
      "It turned out all right in the end, with Sarah's on-screen daughter Bethany being all grown up herself now (played  by Lucy Fallon) and still on the show.",
      "3. Her husband, the serial killer",
      "After suffering several heartbreaks - due to the murder of her first husband and then the infidelities of second spouse Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) - Gail appeared to have found happiness in 2002 when she married Richard Hillman (Brian Capron).",
      "But to her horror, it transpired her new beau had murdered not only his ex-wife but also Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw), as well as attempting to kill Gail's own mum Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) and neighbour Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire).",
      "Gail, with a now legendary line, branded Richard as \"Norman Bates with a briefcase\", a reference to the serial killer in classic Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho.",
      "She then ended the marriage, which led to Richard kidnapping her, her son David, Sarah and Bethany with the intention of killing them all.",
      "An audience of more than 19 million watched the story reach its climax as he drove her and her family into a canal... killing only himself.",
      "Christmas Eve's episode ended with Gail receiving a visit from a certain ghost of Christmas past.",
      "4. That fight with Eileen Grimshaw",
      "In 2004, angry at how Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) was treating her daughter Sarah, Gail found herself embroiled in a fight with his mother Eileen (Sue Cleaver) that spilled out on to the street.",
      "Having yelled at both Todd and Eileen, Gail goaded the latter into slapping her, before all (hair-pulling) hell broke loose.",
      "When Eileen's other son Jason (Ryan Thomas) arrived on the scene from work, still wearing a hard hat, Gail declared: \"Here they are, the rest of the Village People!\"",
      "As the decades rolled on, the feud continued - but for a respectful ceasefire - with each woman aiming digs at the other about their respective love lives.",
      "It exploded again properly in 2015 when the pair argued over the affections of Gail's fifth husband Michael (Les Dennis).",
      "Cleaver confirmed to the BBC that they had \"never pulled each other's hair\" or \"punched or slapped each other\" in real life, and had in fact been good friends for many years.",
      "\"I think there's going to be a huge hole left by Helen leaving,\" she said. \"We've finished filming and you can feel her absence.",
      "\"You're just so used to seeing her, that twinkly-eyed little lady who's just a ball of joy, she's going to be hugely missed.",
      "\"I mean, that character - she's such an icon. She's one of the last greats.\"",
      "Eileen was not the only Weatherfield woman to be on the receiving end of Gail's anger when defending her family.",

      "\"Ken, do something!\" exclaimed a cake-splattered Deidre.",
      "5. Falsely imprisoned for murder",
      "In 2010, Gail got married again, this time to Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale).",
      "This one wasn't any happier in the end, though, as he decided he was going to fake his own death due to debts.",
      "But he accidentally drowned for real on a boat trip, leading to his new wife being arrested for murder after witnesses said they'd seen the couple arguing (about his aforementioned plan).",
      "In prison, troublemaker Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) lied that her cellmate Gail had confessed to killing Joe.",
      "Luckily for one of the street's most downtrodden characters, Gail was found not guilty and released.",
      "6. Helping her son deal with his wife's death",
      "Gail had her troubles with son David (Jack P. Shepherd) as well, once accusing him of delibrately causing \"fear and misery to everyone in this family\".",
      "\"We've had sleepless nights,\" she added dramatically. \"I'm on pills, for God's sake!\"",
      "By 2016, David was a married man himself. However, that came to a tragic end when his wife Kylie (Paula Lane) was stabbed to death, dying in David's arms.",
      "Gail's motherly advice was for him to be honest with his own children about what had happened.",
      "In a heart-rending, tear-filled scene, she recalled the day she had struggled to tell her eldest son Nick (nowadays Ben Price) the truth about his dad Brian being killed, explaining that the boy had been left scarred.",
      "\"It was just about the worst conversation of my life,\" Gail told David, with a wry laugh to break the tension. \"And it's had some competition.\"",
      "Price told the BBC that while his on-screen mum's big storylines \"were great\", he would miss the \"beautiful bits in between\" with her the most.",
      "\"For me, it's being welcomed into the Platts' [house] in the morning, or having a cup of tea, or going, 'Don't worry mum'.",
      "\"Those moments, for me, were Corrie and were gold.",
      "\"They make me smile.\"",
      "7. Gail's moving monologue",
      "In 2018, Gail powerfully expressed the shock and grief of Weatherfield residents following the devastating suicide of factory boss Aidan Connor.",
      "In an emotional monologue, she reflected on the fact you don't really know what's going on in each other's lives, as footage switched between different characters being told the news.",
      "It was originally meant to be a silent sequence, but writer Jonathan Harvey told BBC News: \"It felt like it needed the gravitas of one of our longest-running characters to pass comment on the community that, when the programme started, was close-knit, looked out for each other and knew everybody's business. That's the cliche of what soaps are.",
      "\"And yet [she was saying], if you did know everybody's business then you would have seen this coming.\"",
      "The powerful scene was nominated for Bafta's Must See Moment award.",
      "Speaking before Worth's final scenes, Coronation Street's executive producer Iain MacLeod confirmed she wouldn't die. \"It didn't feel like killing her off would be right,\" he told the Daily Star.",

      "\"When I found out we were going to do the Christmas special, I cried of happiness,\" says actor Tyger Drew-Honey, who plays Jake alongside co-stars Daniel Roche (Ben) and Ramona Marquez (Karen).",
      "Outnumbered, which ran from 2007 to 2014, follows mum Sue (played by Claire Skinner) and dad Pete (Hugh Dennis) navigating family life with their kids.",
      "This article contains spoilers for the Outnumbered Christmas special...",
      "The part-improvised comedy won best sitcom at the British Comedy Awards in 2009 and a National Television Award for most popular sitcom in 2012.",
      "In between shooting scenes, the actors fondly recall April Fools' jokes with the crew, screaming \"bloody murder\" at their beloved on-set tutor and playing hide and seek in their trailers.",
      "\"You wouldn't think there were that many places to hide but when Ramona was littler, I think she'd been in every cupboard in one of those trailers,\" says Drew-Honey, now 28.",
      "The show returned for a one-off Christmas special in 2016 - and it's now back this Boxing Day.",
      "The new episode sees Sue and Pete host Christmas at their downsized home for their grown-up children.",
      "And there are some additions, including Jake's new family: partner Rani (Kerena Jagpal) and daughter Zara (Aurora Skarli).",
      "While the show won awards for comedy, the latest episode explores a more serious storyline.",

      "The actors were excited to return to the show as adults and reunite with their on-screen parents.",
      "Drew-Honey says after leaving the show, he \"had this arrogance. I thought, 'Oh, yeah, well, there's just always going to be a big job coming every year.'\"",
      "Following Outnumbered, Drew-Honey went on to star in comedy Cuckoo and documentary series Tyger Takes On. However, he says some years he would only have \"two or three\" acting jobs \"months apart\".",
      "Returning as an adult, he explains: \"It was just really nice for us all to be there as professional adults, working with our peers.\"",
      "Roche, 25, says \"there were obviously a couple of anxieties going into it as an adult, you know, you're more kind of self-conscious.\"",
      "However, he appreciated the \"unique experience\" of entering an old environment \"where almost everything else is largely the same as it used to be, but you're different now.\"",
      "And Roche was better able to relate to his older co-stars: \"I was talking to Hugh about politics, finally knowing about it.\"",
      "Marquez, 23, says it was interesting returning to the set as an adult. Aged just five when filming the pilot, she would have to take regular welfare breaks.",
      "However, now she explains she can stay and watch others filming, adding \"it almost made it more fun.\"",
      "She also starred in the Oscar-winning film The King's Speech and since filming the show she has graduated from the University of Manchester.",
      "You can watch Outnumbered on BBC One at 21:40 GMT on Boxing Day and on BBC iPlayer.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 01:20:18 GMT",
    "summary": "The Olympic medallist had a miscarriage and an ectopic pregnancy. Did sport affect her ability to conceive?",
    "story": [
      "Dame Laura, 32, gave her body to cycling for more than a decade. She is Britain's most successful female athlete.",
      "\"Every training session I went in there to give 100%, every race I went in there to give 100%.",
      "\"I took it to the limit - if I wasn't sick after a race I'd be like, 'Did I try hard enough?'\"",
      "That absolute commitment was rewarded in the velodrome. Two golds at the London 2012 Olympics were followed by two more at Rio 2016.",
      "She married fellow cycling phenomenon Jason Kenny later that year and the couple welcomed their first baby, Albie, in 2017. She then secured another gold and silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021).",
      "But she miscarried in November 2021 and five months later had an ectopic pregnancy, in which the embryo implants outside of the womb, requiring emergency surgery.",
      "\"Everything was a shock - I went from being so in control of my body to being so out of control,\" she told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "She had never really worried about her own fertility before. Conceiving Albie had been straightforward, and that pregnancy went smoothly. And thankfully, she would successfully give birth to another son, Monty, in July 2023.",
      "But - as Dame Laura began to talk publicly about her baby losses - other athletes told her they had been through the same thing.",
      "It has left a nagging question - could elite sport have a damaging impact on the fertility of female athletes?",
      "\"Was my body just running on empty, and then it said, 'Well, hang on, there's no way we can do this?'\" she says.",
      "Miscarriage is common. The NHS says one-in-eight known pregnancies end before 24 weeks and many occur at a very early stage. Most couples never find out why.",
      "But are athletes at greater risk of any type of fertility problem?",
      "Dr Emma O'Donnell, an exercise physiologist at Loughborough University, says the lifestyle of a professional athlete puts a unique strain on the human body.",
      "Elite training burns a phenomenal number of calories and, as a result, athletes' bodies are often lean and muscular, containing very little body fat.",
      "If they don't eat enough food to keep up with the calorie burn then issues with menstrual cycles, such as periods stopping for months or even years, are \"very common\", Dr O'Donnell says.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of female athletes experience interrupted periods, particularly in endurance sports. There are comparably high rates of periods disappearing in competitors in sports like gymnastics, ballet and figure skating. This compares to only 2-5% of the general population.",
      "Absent periods can be a sign that ovulation (or egg release) isn't happening.",
      "How does that happen in the body?",
      "\"We're not 100% sure,\" says Dr O'Donnell, but the leading idea is that having a baby is so energy-intensive that the brain shuts off reproduction if it thinks there is insufficient spare energy.",
      "It starts in the hypothalamus, a small structure in the centre of the brain that senses the nutritional state of the body.",
      "Sitting just underneath the hypothalamus is the body's hormone factory - the pituitary gland.",
      "Normally, the gland releases hormones that travel down to the womb and ovaries to control the monthly menstrual cycle and the release of an egg, which makes pregnancy possible.",
      "But if the hypothalamus isn't happy, this process breaks down and ovulation doesn't happen.",
      "\"If you're not ovulating you can't have a baby. You can't conceive because there's no egg being released,\" says Dr O'Donnell.",
      "The biggest factor in this seems to be the huge number of calories burned while training, which can leave athletes struggling to eat enough food to compensate.",
      "This phenomenon is known as relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S), and was first recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 2014.",
      "But other factors are also likely to be involved, says Prof Geeta Nargund, a consultant at St George's Hospital and medical director of Create Fertility.",
      "Fat in the body helps make the sex hormone oestrogen.",
      "\"If the sport is affecting body fat content, then quite clearly there's an effect on oestrogen levels,\" she says.",
      "Psychological stress \u2013 potentially from the pressures of training and competing \u2013 can also disrupt the menstrual cycle.",
      "\"We do see this in women with high levels of anxiety,\" said Dr O'Donnell.",
      "Disruption to periods and egg release is the most clearly recognised impact on a female athlete's fertility, but this should resolve once they retire from competition, she notes.",
      "Ectopic and miscarriage",
      "For those who do manage to conceive, things can still go wrong. After an egg is fertilised, it should implant into the lining of the womb. However, in an ectopic pregnancy the egg implants elsewhere, usually in the fallopian tubes that connect the ovaries to the womb.",
      "Around 11,000 pregnancies a year in the UK are ectopic. It's not completely clear why they happen, although inflammation and scar tissue in the fallopian tubes can increase the risk.",
      "\"But in this case, I don't see a direct link between sports and an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancy,\" said Prof Nargund, who has treated athletes struggling with their fertility.",
      "However, she said there was a potential link between too much intense exercise in the first three months of pregnancy and miscarriage \u2013 although far more research is needed to be certain.",
      "She pointed to a large Danish study that followed more than 90,000 women and suggested the more intense exercise women did, the higher the risk. This was particularly for weight-bearing and high-impact exercises.",
      "\"If you end up in the Laura Kenny territory where you're an elite athlete, you're the very top of that,\" Prof Nargund said.",
      "But she explained the findings needed to be taken \"with caution\" because the way the study was designed meant there could be other explanations that had not been considered.",
      "Meanwhile, a very small study of 34 Norwegian athletes found no increased risk of fertility problems, including miscarriage.",
      "\"We need to do a lot more research when it comes to sports, exercise, hormone balance and reproduction,\" says Prof Nargund.",
      "Athletes freezing their eggs",
      "Lauren Nicholls played elite level netball for 10 years then had two children, before becoming coach of Super League champions Loughborough Lightning. She says the conversations current players have about fertility are different to the ones she had with her teammates.",
      "\"I know a few of the slightly older players - they've frozen eggs and made those decisions for their family for a later date,\" she says. \"Because they're worried about their career.\"",
      "Juggling being an elite athlete and starting a family has always been a tricky challenge. For women, their years of peak fertility overlap with the time they hit their physical peak.",
      "Male athletes are also not immune to fertility issues. Burning more energy than you have coming in may affect testosterone levels, cause sperm abnormalities and even erectile dysfunction.",
      "But for Dr Emma Pullen, a sports exercise researcher at Loughborough, the lack of definitive answers on the impact of elite sport is emblematic of how poorly female athletes have been researched, from fertility to injury risk.",
      "She said research was \"playing catch up\" with the amount of attention on male sport.",
      "\"We're seeing the repercussions of that with growing professionalisation of women's sports and more female athletes than ever before,\" Dr Pullen adds.",
      "Overall, Prof Nargund argues female athletes are likely to face more fertility challenges than other women.",
      "\"There seems to be a fertility problem because of [elite sport's] potential effect on ovulation, including potentially a higher risk of miscarriage,\" she says.",
      "But a definitive answer on exactly how much elite-level exercise is too much is not clear. And that's enough for Dame Laura, for now.",
      "\"The conversation in itself I feel is really important because I want people to start talking,\" Laura says. \"Honestly, I would love it if it was a lot more open.\"",
      "The relationship between exercise and fertility affects all of us though, even if we're a long way from Olympic glory.",
      "How does exercise affect everyone else's fertility?",
      "Most men and women benefit from exercising and losing excess weight before trying to conceive \u2013 this is known to boost fertility.",
      "Regular physical activity reduces stress, improves sleep and makes periods more regular in those with the hormonal condition polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).",
      "But amateur female athletes who train intensively can also end up running on empty and seeing their periods stop, or become irregular.",
      "\"Not to quite the same extent, but it's there,\" says Dr O'Donnell.",
      "Making sure there's a balance between energy intake and energy output is \"really important to ovulatory cycles\" and the key to maintaining reproductive function, she adds.",
      "\"[Amateur athletes] are not aware of the fact of how many calories they really need to put in to meet that energy demand.\""

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of women who are \"plunged into surgical menopause\" are \"being failed by the NHS\", says a menopause support campaigner.",
      "Diane Danzebrink, 58, from Norfolk, has called for an urgent review of surgical menopause care to ensure all clinicians know how to prepare their patients.",
      "Ms Danzebrink, who founded Menopause Support, said awareness had improved significantly, but \"we haven't seen change fundamentally to ensure every woman has access to good quality care at the time that she needs it\".",
      "The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) said it directed clinicians to comprehensive guidelines on surgical menopause produced by the British Menopause Society and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice).",
      "Ms Danzebrink, who campaigned to put menopause education on the secondary school curriculum, called for comprehensive clinical guidance on surgical menopause for healthcare professionals.",
      "It was made after she received 319 accounts from women who said they had not been told about the side-effects of having both ovaries removed.",
      "\"I read all 319 of those responses and there were several times when I was tearful to read about that much distress... it's awful,\" said the campaigner, who used to live in Buckinghamshire.",
      "One example included a woman who had a hysterectomy aged 28, and by 31 she had severe vaginal atrophy, which was never spoken about.",
      "Other women said they had waited more than a year to see specialists and could not afford to go private.",
      "The online Menopause Support survey of 521 UK-based women, aged 20-59, found 74.5% were not made aware, by health care professionals, of the side-effects of having both ovaries removed.",
      "This included not being told that they could be plunged into premature menopause.",
      "It also found 62% of those eligible for Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) said it was not discussed with them prior to having their surgery, with 36% being prescribed HRT immediately after surgery.",
      "HRT is the first line of treatment for menopause symptoms.",
      "Nice guidelines recommend people who have gone through premature menopause are offered HRT until the age of 50-51, by which time most women have experienced natural menopause.",
      "'Dumbfounded'",
      "Ms Danzebrink, also is also part of the Make Menopause Matter campaign, said the results prompted her to search for clinical guidance for surgical menopause via the RCOG website, but could not find it.",
      "She had hoped set guidance would ensure all health care professionals counselled patients fully, prior to surgery, and provided them with appropriate, ongoing care and support.",
      "\"I'm dumbfounded by the fact the organisation that represents the clinicians who are going to be removing ovaries doesn't feel it needs either information for the public or guidance for clinicians,\" she said.",
      "\"I think it is important to say in the last 10 years, things definitely are starting to move in the right direction.",
      "\"There's more awareness and more information, but we need that information to be absolutely across the board, for all of our healthcare practitioners to be able to feel confident in their menopause knowledge.\"",

    "story": [
      "Four years ago, Isobel Perl was living with friends in London and thriving. She was working for a big accountancy firm and had a busy social life.",
      "Then the pandemic hit and she lost her job. Aged 25, she had to move back in with her parents in Watford.",
      "She decided to start a skincare brand, despite knowing nothing about the industry. It was a big success until one wrong business decision, which triggered her trichotillomania - a hair-pulling disorder that meant she could not resist the urge to pull out her eyelashes.",
      "Here, in her own words, Isobel explains how she managed to overcome the disorder and get her business back on track.",
      "'A lot of people doubted me'",
      "When I lost my job, I didn't even qualify for any redundancy pay. It was a really difficult time for me and it knocked my confidence.",
      "I had thought of the idea for my skincare brand PERL cosmetics a few years before, but I didn't have the time, the money or the knowledge to start it.",
      "After losing my job, I decided to throw myself into it. For the first year and a half of the business, I was running around like a headless chicken. I didn't have a business plan. I didn't know who my target audience was. I didn't know anything. I set up a website and just chipped away at it day by day.",
      "A lot of people doubted me. I look back now and I'm proud I had the balls to ignore them. I was just so excited by the idea. But at the same time I knew I needed a steady income. I ended up starting a job as a project manager at the Ministry of Defence and I thought my business would just be a side hustle.",
      "Then in January 2021, when I started posting on Tiktok, things just blew up and I quit my new full-time job. In the first few months, I went from zero to 50,000 followers and I generated \u00a310,000 in sales, which was double what I had done in the whole six months prior.",
      "People started following me for the journey, I don't just share the good stuff. I think it's refreshing to see someone admit to struggling.",
      "'The stress triggered trichotillomania'",
      "Everything was going well until last spring. I started the business in the pandemic and I had never known what it was like to run a business outside of that. Everyone was on their phones and people had more disposable income but then life went back to normal. It was almost like a perfect storm for e-commerce businesses. But then sales really stagnated.",
      "So I decided to spend the remaining \u00a38,000 of the company's cash on advertising but I didn't see a return from that. I had to reinvest my own savings back into the business because I had nothing but I still had people to pay and bills coming out.",
      "It was a really difficult time, and it triggered my trichotillomania, which is an uncontrollable urge to pull out body hair. I've had it since I was 14 but thought it had gone away.",
      "For me it's a feeling that there's an eyelash that needs to be pulled out and it's a relief when you do that. I couldn't stop doing it. But then you feel guilt and shame and it's a never ending cycle.",
      "I decided maybe it was time to quit my business, I was so frustrated and I felt like it had consumed my whole life. I did this post on TikTok explaining my situation and it got two million views.",
      "Everyone got behind me and supported me, the sales went up and it was the best month I've ever had in terms of revenue.",
      "'I had 5,000 people on the waiting list'",
      "I started opening up about my trichotillomania on social media and I got so many messages from people who also suffer from it. I realised I wasn't the only person that does this.",
      "I was using eyelash serums to try and grow my lashes back but my eyes were getting really sore and red. I realised some of the serums on the market contain a synthetic growth hormone. So I created a lash oil made from natural plant seed oils and people started commenting asking if they could buy it.",
      "By the time I launched it, I had 5,000 people on the waiting list. The lash oil is now my best-selling product, and makes up around 80% of my sales, it has sold out six or seven times and has generated \u00a3400,000 in sales since I launched it last summer.",
      "I've now got a team of eight part-time employees. We hand-make and pack the products in small batches at a lab near my home.",
      "'I wish I'd had more self-belief'",
      "I really want to create a brand where I can try and end the stigma around mental health. I have always suffered from anxiety and depression but I feel so much better when I'm taking care of myself.",
      "I firmly believe there is a link between doing your skin care and looking after yourself properly to help relieve depression and anxiety. Also most people living with skin conditions find their mental health and wellbeing suffers as a result, so the two things are definitely related.",
      "One day I would love to get stocked in shops. I'm also working as a business coach and mentor now and I love helping other young people who are starting out, because I didn't know what I was doing when I started. I tell them everything I wish I had known at the start. I just love helping people, it's a really good feeling.",
      "Looking back, there are a lot of things that I would have done differently but I don't have any regrets. However, I would love to go back and tell myself to have more self-belief.",
      "I firmly believe that everything happens for a reason. If my trichotillomania had not got really bad after wasting a lot of money then I would never have created the lash oil that is keeping my business afloat.",
      "With the money it is generating, I am working to expand the product range and develop better packaging and invest in more marketing, so it's definitely been my saviour.",

      "'It was the hardest period of my life'",
      "When my eldest son Jude was a baby, he was slow to crawl and didn't respond to his name. He used to stare out of the window, he was quite distant and almost in a different world.",
      "His mum Charlotte, my ex-wife, first raised concerns when he was eight months old but I just thought he was a bit behind because he was premature.",
      "We went back to the doctor quite a few times before we got an autism diagnosis in 2009 when he was 18 months old.",
      "At the time, the information out there was very clinical, most things we were reading were from the NHS website and medical journals. I felt like I couldn't take it in and I had so many unanswered questions.",
      "Three years later we went through the same diagnosis with Tommy at a similar age.",
      "I knew a lot more about autism than when we had Jude, but the boys have always been so different.",

      "He hit certain milestones much quicker than Jude but he wouldn't make eye contact and would get easily frustrated and enjoyed playing alone.",
      "Around the same time, when Jude was four, he started having huge meltdowns and was physically hurting himself.",
      "Jude is non-speaking, so it's very difficult for him to explain what's wrong. That was the hardest period of my life.",
      "He used to wake up in the night screaming and hitting himself. Thankfully as Jude has gotten older, and we've learnt more about how to meet his needs, this has got much better.",

      "I wish I could be with both of them at the same time, and I don't get much free time, but this is the best thing for them right now. It has probably made being a single parent easier for me because I'm never alone.",

      "I didn't realise how much our stories would resonate with others, or how much it would help me.",
      "I learned so much more about autism, connected with people all over the world and discovered a passion for helping other families.",

      "Among Sir Keir's ministers, I pick up two recurring sentiments about the party's first six months in power.",
      "The first - and you can still see it in the eyes of ministers when they reflect upon their work - is an excitement after years in the wilderness of opposition that they now have power, and are called upon to make decisions every day.",
      "But the second is a frustration at too many mistakes.",
      "One minister told me they were fed up at what they saw as lacklustre presentation and communication, particularly of difficult stuff like taking the winter fuel payment away from millions of pensioners.",
      "Another acknowledged it had taken them and fellow ministers a while to step up from being administrators, getting a grip of their new jobs and getting used to taking decisions, to being senior politicians in government and taking decisions in a wider, strategic context.",
      "\"We are no longer the political wing of the civil service,\" observed one Labour backbencher on that learning curve for the new government, which included the brutal removal of the prime minister's first chief of staff, Sue Gray, not long after I was leaked private details of her salary.",
      "Politics at Westminster feels much more competitive than the numbers suggest it should: Labour's mountainous majority means they will rarely feel even a marginally quickened pulse when it comes to Commons votes.",
      "But one of the cliches of 2024, because it is true, is Labour's support feels broad but shallow.",
      "They won a landslide majority with just 34% of the vote, a lower vote share than any party forming a post war majority government.",
      "Opinion polling and approval ratings for both Labour and Sir Keir have taken a hammering since they were elected.",
      "So what of the Conservatives and their new leader Kemi Badenoch?",
      "They have been more chipper and more united than they might have been, given just how big a defeat they went down to back in July.",
      "But privately many Tories fear they have not yet hit rock bottom.",
      "They look ahead, but do not look forward, to the local elections in England, in May, where plenty of Tories reckon they will go backwards.",
      "This is because the seats being contested were last fought in 2021, a high point for Boris Johnson after the pandemic, so they have plenty of seats to lose.",
      "Senior Tories tell me privately they reckon Badenoch has made a middling start in the toughest of jobs.",
      "Even her supporters acknowledge they are relieved she hasn't done or said anything that has rebounded on her, given she has something of a reputation for putting her foot in her mouth now and again.",
      "And they hope she will shake off a scepticism, bordering on suspicion, of journalists and get out more in the new year to make their case.",
      "And they will need to, because the word you hear rather often from Conservative MPs is\u2026",
      "Reform.",
      "The name of Nigel Farage's party, Reform UK, sends shivers down many a Tory spine, and Labour aren't immune to concerns about them either.",

      "That seems a fantastical proposition for an upstart outfit whose entire parliamentary party \u2013 five MPs \u2013 could fit in the back of a taxi.",
      "But remember they attracted 4.1 million votes at the general election, 600,000 more than the Liberal Democrats.",
      "The issue Reform had was their votes were spread out, rather than piling up in sufficient numbers in particular places to win many seats.",
      "In 2025, it will be worth keeping an eye on two men within Reform \u2013 the chair, Zia Yusuf, and the new Treasurer, Nick Candy.",
      "They personify Nigel Farage's twin aims for his party \u2013 getting more organised and generating money.",
      "The party is trying to build local branches around the country, local nerve centres of enthusiasm that could be the building block for winning more seats at local elections, at devolved elections (coming in Scotland and Wales in 2026) and at the next general election.",
      "Expect to see a blitz of regional conferences in the opening weeks of the new year to try to drive this growth.",
      "The Lib Dems had a corker of a 2024.",
      "They won beyond their dreams and Sir Ed Davey now leads a party of 72 MPs.",
      "Sir Ed remains determined to do politics with a smile \u2013 take his Christmas single as the latest example of that \u2013 and trying to own the issues of social care, young carers and the health service.",
      "The party is trying to maximise the exposure their status as Westminster's third party gives them \u2013 Sir Ed went on Have I Got News For You recently, for instance, although invites like that can prove awkward.",
      "In the next few weeks, don't be surprised if he pops up talking about foreign affairs and outflanks the broadly pro-European noises we've heard from Labour by talking about a potential UK future back inside the European Union's customs union.",
      "The party also has an optimistic eye on the local elections in May, particularly in counties such as Devon, Surrey, Shropshire and Wiltshire.",
      "The challenge for Sir Ed will be converting a much bigger parliamentary party into influence in an era of a big majority government and noisy fellow opposition parties.",
      "The SNP had a dreadful 2024: nearly nuked in the general election by the rampant return of Labour in Scotland.",
      "But speaking to senior figures as the year drew to a close, their mood was less bleak than it might have been.",
      "The row over so-called Waspi women and Labour maintaining the two child benefit cap are just two examples where the SNP hope to point to clear differences between them and Labour, in the countdown to elections to the Scottish Parliament in 2026.",
      "Green MPs around Westminster wear plenty of smiles as we head into 2025.",
      "For a start we now say Greens plural when talking about them - for the first time there is more than one of them.",
      "They have seen their party membership swell to around 60,000 and they are hoping too to swell their presence on councils in those English local elections in May.",
      "Senior figures point out that they are currently part of the administration in over 10% of councils in England and Wales and finished second behind Labour in 40 seats at the general election.",
      "In some of those places they are miles behind, but in others there is at least the chance that they might be able to capitalise over time on disgruntlement with Labour and lure voters on Labour's Left in their direction. Let's see.",
      "And don't forget Plaid Cymru; the parliamentary group known as the Independent Alliance, which includes the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn; and the parties of Northern Ireland, all of whom have their own concerns and campaigns - and can cause ructions for ministers inside and outside Parliament.",
      "Here goes with politics in 2025.",
      "It might not be a general election year.",
      "But I reckon it will be lively."

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 03:16:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Newly-released files show ministers had concerns about more workers coming to the UK when the EU expanded.",
    "story": [
      "Senior ministers urged the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to delay granting employment rights to eastern and central European workers when the EU expanded in 2004, newly released files have revealed.",
      "In February that year, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw pointed out that Britain was alone amongst the bigger EU members in offering a \"concession\".",
      "The concession meant people from Poland and other newly joined EU countries would be able to work in Britain after 1 May.",
      "Almost all the other large states would not allow this for two years: only Italy was undecided. Smaller EU countries, aside from Ireland, had work permit schemes which would limit numbers.",
      "Papers from the National Archives - which have been released now they are 20 years old - show Straw proposed a six-month delay for the UK.",
      "He said: \"I believe we could be faced with a very difficult situation in early May\".",
      "He warned the UK could \"be forced to revoke the concession in the least propitious of circumstances\".",
      "His letter was copied to other senior ministers, and the then-deputy prime minister John Prescott supported Straw.",
      "Prescott wrote that he was \"extremely concerned\" about the potential impact on social housing.",
      "He was also worried that many workers would come to London and the South East, and unable to find decent housing would \"resort to sharing overcrowded housing in poor conditions\".",
      "But David Blunkett, the then-home secretary, argued the economy needed the \"flexibility and productivity\" these new workers could provide.",
      "Eight eastern and central European countries joined the EU in 2004, including Poland. According to the government, the number of Polish nationals living in the UK increased from around 69,000 to around 853,000 over the next decade.",
      "Blair asked whether the UK could have work permits, but instead the Home Office speedily drew up a \"workers registration scheme\".",
      "That scheme required A8 workers - those from the eight new member states - to pay a fee and register their employment in a specific job. Failing to do so would incur a significant fine.",
      "From May 2004 onwards, No 10 monitored these registration numbers week by week.",
      "The government was particularly worried because it had publicly estimated that only 13,000 new workers a year would come to Britain after the EU expanded.",
      "The files show that Kate Gross, one of the private secretaries at No 10, wrote to the prime minister on 2 July 2004.",
      "She enclosed a briefing note for the press which would say \"the influx of new arrivals predicted by the media simply hasn't arrived\", even though that 13,000 had been exceeded.",
      "She explained that while 24,000 people had registered with the scheme, most had been living in the UK before 1 May.",
      "Kate Gross's memo notes that most were young, aged 18-34 - and there was no evidence of them \"exploiting the benefits system\". Blair scrawled \"that is the key\" by the side of that statement.",
      "However Kate Gross noted \"the key elephant trap is how these figures relate to previous HO [Home Office] projections\".",
      "If applications continued to increase, she wrote, the number of new arrivals would hit \"50-60,000 by May 2005\".",
      "The next set of figures for the scheme showed a drop, and a briefing paper to No 10 said: \"It looks like we are over the peak in applications.\"",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Directorate \"should be congratulated on implementing the workers registration scheme in short order\", it said.",
      "The problem was, the scheme wasn't providing an accurate record.",
      "The self-employed did not have to register, for example, which excluded many building workers like carpenters.",
      "And there was little enforcement.",
      "The shortcomings of the workers registration scheme were exposed in late 2005, when according to the WRS there were only 95 Polish plumbers in the whole of the  UK.",
      "In 24 hours the Daily Mail found 95 Polish plumbers in London alone.",
      "Over the next few years hundreds of thousands of A8 nationals, mostly Polish, moved to the UK.",

    "story": [
      "Visitors' books from Downing Street signed by some of the most famous figures in recent history have been made public for the first time.",
      "World leaders and members of the Royal Family are among the names in the three red leather, gilt-tooled volumes being released by the National Archives, spanning 1970 to 2003.",
      "The names of visitors to No 10 are not made public so the books provide a valuable record of who had private conversations with prime ministers.",
      "One of the volumes was offered for sale earlier this year by a London auction house who said it had been rescued from a waterlogged basement by a former civil servant, but the government blocked the sale saying it was Crown property.",
      "Dr Jack Brown, lecturer at King's College London described the books as \"wonderful... historical novelties\".",
      "As the first resident researcher at No 10, he explained the book wasn't left on a table for everyone to sign, but only offered to special guests.",
      "Some left private messages, especially to Margaret Thatcher, who spent more than a decade in Downing Street from 1979 to 1990.",
      "In 1989, then US President George Bush wrote: \"With Respect, Friendship and Gratitude for this Relationship that means so much\".",
      "Dr Brown said he was referring to the so-called special relationship between Britain and the US, rather than a personal bond, but President Bush's wife Barbara also signed, adding: \"Me. Too.\"",
      "Relations with fellow EU leaders were not always so smooth.",
      "That same year the French Prime Minister Michel Rocard wrote: \"It always is an extraordinary occasion to confront with the Prime Minister, especially when we agree, even when we disagree. Thank you very, very much.\"",
      "\"That was wonderful,\" said Dr Brown, \"I think you did confront with Thatcher... particularly if you were a socialist French prime minister, towards the end of her term.\"",
      "The visitors' book seems to have been introduced by the Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, who was in office from 1970-1974.",
      "Among the earliest to sign it were members of the Royal Family, who left just their first name, including in March 1971 an entry which reads \"Charles\", from the then Prince of Wales.",
      "Many Asian and African leaders signed the first volume. One name from 12 July 1971, in uneven letters reads: \"General I Amin Dada\" \u2013 Idi Amin of Uganda.",
      "Amin had taken power in a coup six months before, and the brutal nature of his regime wasn't yet clear to Western governments. In 1971 he was invited to Buckingham Palace, as well as Downing Street.",
      "Just a year later, Amin expelled tens of thousands of Ugandan Asians, giving them only 90 days to leave the country. Many held British passports and came to settle in the UK.",
      "Among the world leaders - including Jimmy Carter, Ferdinand Marcos and Indira Gandhi - is an anomaly, four pages packed with signatures of well-known British women of 1978 - Anna Ford, Cleo Laine, Prue Leith and Janet Street-Porter.",
      "The latter was a well-known face on TV, but Janet Street-Porter remembers being intimidated by the event, a reception to mark 50 years of equal suffrage.",
      "\"I always appeared cocky and self-assured,\" she said, \"but to be invited to Downing Street for something so historically important was quite a formidable experience for me.\"",
      "While there were many receptions in Downing Street, the book was brought out for very few \u2013 including to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Downing Street in 1985.",
      "The Queen and Prince Philip signed, as did six other prime ministers, including the increasingly frail Harold Macmillan, Lord Stockton.",
      "The book captures the changing times: President Mikhail Gorbachev signed in April 1989, when he came for a state visit with his wife, Raisa.",
      "Early the following year, the leaders of the newly independent Eastern European countries visited No 10 - including Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, who added his trademark little heart.",
      "The book seems to have been rarely used by John Major and Tony Blair, though there is one striking message from early 2002, a few months after the 9/11 attacks.",
      "Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani wrote: \"Mr. Prime Minister, we are eternally grateful for your support for us at a time of great peril, you will always hold a special place in the minds and hearts of all New Yorkers and Americans.\"",
      "Dr Brown said \"despite being a seemingly semi-random collection of autographs\", the book was a \"story of Britain's place in the world\" told in these signatures over time.",
      "Janet Street-Porter, who has visited Downing Street several times since 1978, thinks all guest lists should be published.",

      "Get serious on pay in 2025, TUC chief tells ministers",
      "The letter - which is also understood to have been sent to the Environment Agency, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and healthcare regulators - was first reported by Sky News.",
      "Signed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, it said ministers believed collaboration to be essential to ensure the regulatory environment became \"more pro-growth and pro-investment\" while respecting the independence of regulators.",
      "The FCA said it would reply in the new year. It added that it had already delivered measures since the summer to support growth, including reforming information that retail investors receive, as well as making proposals to provide better value for money for workplace pensions.",
      "The letter said improving regulation to enable growth and not hold back investment was \"an essential part\" of the government's growth mission.",

      "This letter is evidence that Sir Keir wants to pull every possible governmental lever to make sure arms-length bodies like regulators, as well as government departments, prioritise helping deliver Labour's mission of achieving the highest sustained economic growth in the G7.",
      "It is also an indication that the prime minister fears regulators can restrain economic growth by imposing obstacles to business activity \u2013 a message typically more associated with Conservative politicians but which Starmer is increasingly putting at the heart of his plans.",

      "And in October, addressing a summit of international investors in London, he said: \"We've got to look at regulation across the piece, and where it is needlessly holding back investment\u2026 mark my words, we will get rid of it\".",
      "On the other side of the argument will be groups in various sectors where there is a regulator, who argue that what the government sees as obstacles are in fact necessary rules.",
      "Conservative MP Griffith said that if the prime minister wants the UK to exhibit the fastest growth in the G7, then \"he'd have more luck turning the clock back to before the general election when the UK was growing under the Conservatives\".",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Keir warned MPs it would take some time for people to feel their living standards improve.",
      "This week Reeves also said the challenge was to fix the economy \"after 15 years of neglect is huge\", while shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the figures showed \"growth has tanked on Labour's watch\"."

    "story": [
      "On Christmas Eve, an autonomous spacecraft flew past the Sun, closer than any human-made object before it. Swooping through the atmosphere, Nasa's Parker Solar Probe was on a mission to discover more about the Sun, including how it affects space weather on Earth.",
      "This was a landmark moment for humanity \u2013 but one without any human directly involved, as the spacecraft carried out its pre-programmed tasks by itself as it flew past the sun, with no communication with Earth at all.",
      "Robotic probes have been sent across the solar system for the last six decades, reaching destinations impossible for humans. During its 10-day flyby, the Parker Solar Probe experienced temperatures of 1000C.",
      "But the success of these autonomous spacecraft \u2013 coupled with the rise of new advanced artificial intelligence \u2013 raises the question of what role humans might play in future space exploration.",
      "Some scientists question whether human astronauts are going to be needed at all.",
      "\"Robots are developing fast, and the case for sending humans is getting weaker all the time,\" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal. \"I don't think any taxpayer's money should be used to send humans into space.\"",
      "He also points to the risk to humans.",
      "\"The only case for sending humans [there] is as an adventure, an experience for wealthy people, and that should be funded privately,\" he argues.",
      "Andrew Coates, a physicist from University College London, agrees. \"For serious space exploration, I much prefer robotics,\" he says. \"[They] go much further and do more things.\"",
      "They are also cheaper than humans, he argues. \"And as AI progresses, the robots can be cleverer and cleverer.\"",
      "But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts \u2013 and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could?",
      "Rovers versus mankind",
      "Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon.",
      "In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket).",
      "\"Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,\" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. \"It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant.\"",
      "But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science.",
      "Robots can contribute to that scientific research, with the ability to travel to locations inhospitable to humans, where they can use instruments to study and probe the atmospheres and surfaces.",
      "\"Humans are more versatile and we get stuff done faster than a robot, but we're really hard and expensive to keep alive in space,\" says Dr Weinersmith.",
      "In her 2024 Booker Prize-winning novel Orbital, author Samantha Harvey puts it more lyrically: \"A robot has no need for hydration, nutrients, excretion, sleep\u2026 It wants and asks for nothing.\"",
      "But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical \u2013 for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph.",
      "\"AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?\" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. \"I just don't think we know.\"",
      "He does, however, believe that AI algorithms might enable rovers to be \"more efficient\".",
      "AI assistants and humanoid robots",
      "Technology can play a part in complementing human space travel by freeing up astronauts from certain tasks to allow them to focus on more important research.",
      "\"[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,\" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. \"On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't.\"",
      "The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. \"We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has\" \u2013 meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM.",
      "Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans.",
      "Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities.",
      "Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa's Robonaut was the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans.",
      "Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems.",
      "A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly.",
      "\"If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,\" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. \"We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around.\"",
      "He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them.",
      "Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input.",
      "\"You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep.\"",
      "But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot.",
      "\"Inspiration is something that is intangible,\" argues Prof Coates.",
      "Leroy Chiao, a retired Nasa astronaut who went on three flights to space in the 1990s and 2000s on Nasa's Space Shuttle and to the International Space Station, agrees. \"Humans relate when humans are doing something.",
      "\"The general public is excited about robotic missions. But I would expect the first human on Mars to be even bigger than the first Moon landing.\"",
      "Life on Mars?",
      "Humans have not travelled further than Earth's orbit since December 1972, when the last Apollo mission visited the Moon. Nasa is hoping to return humans there this decade with its Artemis programme.",
      "The next crewed mission will see four astronauts fly around the Moon in 2026. A further mission, scheduled for 2027, will see Nasa astronauts land on the Moon's surface.",
      "The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon.",
      "Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans could land.",
      "His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to be a million people on Mars in 20 years.",
      "\"Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,\" explains Dr Weinersmith. \"If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary.\"",
      "However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved.",
      "\"Maybe babies can't develop in that environment,\" she says. \"There [are] ethical questions [like this] that we don't have the answers to.",
      "\"I think we should be slowing down.\"",

      "\"We may have a new species that will be happy to live on Mars.\"",

      "It is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that 1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seized by South Africa's law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.",
      "The South African government is well aware of the problem, and unveiled a  strategy in 2022 to combat poaching. It includes running community programmes about the need to protect the environment.",
      "According to Mr Van Wyk and other conservationists, plant poaching has been booming since the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.",
      "With international traders unable to travel to South Africa during that time, they turned to local people to collect succulents for them and post them out of the country.",
      "Mr Van Wyk says this coincided with an increase in global demand.",
      "\"People had more time to try to find something to keep busy with, and plants were one of the only things that in your house, could connect you to the outside world.\"",
      "This has been seized upon by organised crime syndicates who hire teams of plant poachers and then market the wild plants on social media and e-commerce platforms.",
      "\"The syndicates saw this as an opportunity of making something viral\u2026 telling a wide as possible public: 'We have this super-strange looking thing that comes from the African continent','\" Mr Van Wyk says.",
      "\"Then the public just loses their heads and they say: 'I want to buy one', and [the syndicates] arrange for the species to be poached,\" he adds.",
      "The uptick in organised crime activity in the region is having knock-on effects on local communities.",
      "\"This is a low-income area, people are not rich here, and people will exploit opportunities for income,\" explains Malinda Gardiner from Conservation South Africa.",
      "Expressing a similar view, the livestock farmer whom the BBC spoke to says there is always an influx of money in her community when poaching takes place.",
      "\"When we see young men going up in the mountain areas, we know they're poachers,\" adds the farmer, who asks not to be identified for fear of reprisals.",
      "\"They use screwdrivers to uproot the succulents and they carry backpacks and sacks to keep the stolen plants.\"",
      "A few days after that, there is an outbreak of binge drinking and illegal activity.",
      "\"When they get the money, there's more drugs, more alcohol, children are neglected because mummy is drunk, daddy is drunk, there's no food,\" adds the farmer.",
      "Ms Gardiner worries that the tensions will have longer-term effects.",
      "\"Small communities here really need each other\u2026 but this brings distrust. It brings a split in the communities as well,\" she says.",
      "Mr Van Wyk's assessment is starker: \"People are being abused and enslaved by syndicates and buyers.\"",
      "Attempts are being made to raise awareness among buyers about the importance of understanding where a plant might have come from.",
      "China has become a major source of demand for wild succulents in the last few years, but an internet campaign there to educate people about the illegal succulent trade has seen some results.",
      "The Clean Internet for Conophytum campaign was launched in March 2023 by the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.",
      "According to the foundation's deputy secretary-general Linda Wong, they have seen an 80% reduction in online adverts for conophytum - a type of succulent - with an unknown source, and buyers are starting to ask questions about where plants being sold online have come from.",
      "\"The key is awareness. Once people know, they want to take action. They want to take responsibility to consume those plants and enjoy their beauty in a very responsible way,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Conservationists advise customers all over the world to ask about the origin of a plant, and under no circumstances should they buy those advertised as wild.",
      "Traffic and the UK's Kew Gardens recently announced that they were teaming up with eBay to develop new ways of preventing the sale of wild succulents on its platform.",
      "In South Africa, Mr Van Wyk says more should be done to promote the cultivation of succulents that can be grown and harvested legally, to reduce the demand for poaching.",
      "\"We as a country need to say that: 'We have this resource, and there are other countries that are majorly benefiting from this, why aren't we?'\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Van Wyk now runs a nursery at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park which looks after plants that have been confiscated by law enforcement, and he says they have received more than 200,000 so far.",
      "\"It's obviously stressful seeing things disappearing. But if you study these plants, it brings so much joy and pleasure and you just forget about all the nonsense that's happening in the world,\" Mr Van Wyk says.",

    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",
      "Many gamers are still sticking with their previous-generation machines, and Sony and Microsoft will be hoping GTA 6 will finally inspire them to upgrade.",
      "\"If anything is going to convince people to jump to a new console if they haven't already it's going to be GTA 6,\" says James, who estimates that PlayStation 4 users still count for 50% of Sony's active players.",
      "But if we're talking hardware upgrades, there could be some competition.",
      "A new Nintendo Switch?",
      "Here's what we know, officially, about Nintendo's next console.",
      "It exists.",
      "Your current Switch games will work on it.",
      "And that's it.",
      "There's no official name yet, but fans have been calling it the Nintendo Switch 2.",
      "Despite unconfirmed leaks and rumours the machine's capabilities remain a mystery and the company's promised some sort of official announcement by the end of March.",
      "There's a feeling, though, that Nintendo won't want to change the winning formula of the original Switch, which has sold 146 million units since its 2017 launch.",
      "\"The sensible money is on just a bigger, better Switch,\" says James.",
      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",
      "But James isn't sure it will experience the same fate.",
      "\"That was a long time ago,\" he says. \"I think they've learned a lot of lessons since then.\"",
      "More breakout hits",
      "Some of 2024's biggest success stories came from small, independent developers.",
      "The most notable was Balatro - an addictive, poker-inspired card game that ended the year in the running for high-profile game of the year awards.",

      "\"There's been so many great indies this year,\" she says.",
      "\"On the triple-A side a lot of critics and players have said 'it's such a quiet year, there's not many big releases', but for indie games, there's always so many cool things to play.\"",
      "A success like Balatro is incredibly rare, and one of the big issues for indie developers in 2024 has been discoverability - getting players to actually find your game.",
      "Rachel says the number of releases on Steam - the online store where most PC games are bought - is \"frankly bonkers\" and getting noticed is \"one of the most difficult things\".",
      "\"I just don't see that becoming any easier,\" she says.",
      "Rachel says indie developers are also struggling to find investment and the financial outlook is \"pretty bleak\" going into 2025.",
      "But she does think that more gamers are starting to recognise the creativity that exists in the sector - and more breakout hits will follow.",
      "\"The indie space is a place where I retreat to just play games that get me excited about gaming again,\" says Rachel.",

    "title": "Elon Musk's 'social experiment on humanity': How X evolved in 2024",
    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:11:08 GMT",
    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",
      "The France rape trial throws up a difficult question about porn fantasies - and male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?",
      "\"I see Trump's feelings towards a platform dictating the way his administration views them,\" argues Mr Freeman.",
      "The question that remains is what Trump's views on this really are - and whether he will demand accountability in a different way from these sites in the future, or not at all.",
      "The ramifications, whichever way it goes, will no doubt be far-reaching.",

    "summary": "How a very popular puzzle that was first invented 50 years ago may have certain wellbeing benefits",
    "story": [
      "On a cold day in November, hundreds of people flocked to an arena in Coventry, which has previously hosted gigs by Oasis, Rihanna, and Harry Styles, for an event of a very different kind.",
      "The 500 people who turned out - some from as far afield as Mongolia and Canada - were taking part in an activity less known for drawing in crowds: the Rubik's UK Championship in \"speedcubing,\" or racing to solve puzzle cubes at terrific speed.",
      "Rows of tables were laid out in the arena and 15 events took place over three days. Some involved solving the puzzle one-handed, others while blindfolded. Teenager James Alonso won the tournament's biggest event - solving the classic 3x3 cube at speed with an average of 6.3 seconds.",
      "Speedcubing has been popular since the 1980s and the world record for a single solve in that event is currently held by Max Park from the US, with a time of just 3.13 seconds. It is a far cry from the initial speed of Ern\u0151 Rubik, an architecture professor, who invented the Rubik's Cube in 1974 and took around a month to solve it.",
      "Flash forward to today and an estimated 412,000 people have taken part in speedcubing competitions worldwide. The popularity has increased too, with reported global sales of Rubik's Cube products recorded as $86.6m (\u00a367m) in 2023, up 13.5% on 2022. (The brand was acquired by a Canadian multinational toy company Spin Master in 2021.)",
      "That's not counting the sales of other types of puzzle cubes by different brands. Some are wooden, others electronic with built-in bluetooth, then there are those with all manner of colourful designs.",
      "But now, scientists have lauded speedcubing, in particular, as not only a popular hobby but one that could have wellbeing benefits too.",
      "\"Speedcubing offers a unique combination of cognitive challenge, [alongside] social connection, and personal achievement that contributes to happiness\", says Polina Beloborodova, research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Centre for Healthy Minds.",
      "And this is said to run far deeper than a simple momentary rush.",
      "Cubing and happiness: what experts say",
      "\"Speedcubing satisfies the basic psychological need for competence, the feeling of effectiveness and mastery,\" explains Dr Beloborodova. It involves a number of factors including, problem-solving, memory, spatial reasoning and motor coordination.",
      "But solving the cube may also elicit happiness because it taps into other emotions, according to Dr Julia Christensen, a senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Germany. \"Awe, beauty, being moved, all these are aesthetic emotions, and experiencing them gives us an extreme sense of happiness,\" she says.",
      "\"For example, when a pattern is the right pattern, when a move is particularly amazing on the cube, these aesthetic emotions can give transformative experiences.\"",
      "Some speedcubers have described the state of mind that the activity can bring as a sense of \"flow\".",
      "\"This state is achieved when the activity's difficulty matches your skill level, distractions are minimal, the goals are clear, and feedback is immediate \u2014 all of which are characteristics of speedcubing,\" says Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Flow can feel \"almost meditative\", according to Ian Scheffler, author of Cracking the Cube, who has experienced this first-hand. \"You enter this state where you are kind of thinking and not thinking at the same time - you are reacting to what the cube is giving you, but in almost an instinctual way.",
      "\"It's a kind of mindfulness that's deeply rewarding\u2026 a peaceful, calm state where you're completely in tune with every twist of the puzzle.\"",
      "There is good reason to seek a flow state regularly, according to Dr Christensen. \"Science shows that people who regularly experience flow have a better mental health, possibly better physical health, and are more in tune.",
      "\"When we repeat movements they become logged or encoded from explicit, effort-full memory systems, and pass into implicit, less effort-full, and procedural memory systems,\" she continues.",
      "Nicholas Archer, a 17-year-old speedcuber from West Yorkshire, who won the one-handed competition in this year's UK Championship with an average time of 8.69 seconds, says that he has experienced this. \"When I'm solving the cube, I'm certainly not having to think too much about what I'm doing. It's all automatic.\"",
      "Speedcubing social benefits",
      "\"Speedcubing or solving a cube on your own may increase your happiness,\" says Dr Adil Khan, a reader in neuroscience at King's College London (KCL) - but when combined with the social aspect, any benefits may be greater.",
      "\"Since speedcubing is a social phenomenon, perhaps the social aspect combines with the puzzle solving to deliver a deeply satisfying experience.\"",
      "Jan Hammer started speedcubing at the age of 44, after being introduced to it by his 13-year-old daughter. He has since solved the cube around 10,000 times but does not think he would have maintained this level of enthusiasm had he been speedcubing alone.",
      "\"The fact that I can do this with my daughter and that we cheer for each other is wonderful. Additionally, being part of the cube community has become a huge motivation.\"",
      "Competitions tend to have more children and teenagers - it is not uncommon for competitors to be as young as six. The activity is also significantly more popular with males. The World Cube Association reports that 221,117 men have competed at their events, compared with 24,311 women.",
      "Regardless of demographic, \"for those who view speedcubing as a significant part of their life - such as participants in tournaments - it can offer eudemonic happiness, fostering a sense of purpose and meaning through dedication, accomplishment, and community of like-minded people,\" argues Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Psychologists differentiate between two aspects of happiness: \"hedonic wellbeing,\" related to emotional experiences, and \"eudemonic wellbeing,\" which concerns meaning and purpose in life.",
      "\"Both are essential for overall happiness and speedcubing can contribute to both types of wellbeing,\" she says. All of this \"contributes to better mental health\".",
      "Puzzles and the brain: the science",
      "The effects of speedcubing on the brain and cognitive function are, however, less clear.",
      "While solving a cube, the brain is trying out different moves, asking \"what might happen if I move the cube in this way?\" explains Dr Toby Wise, senior research fellow in neuroimaging at King's College London.",
      "\"Your brain stores a memory trace for different configurations of the cube, and it can run through different configurations to predict which will have the best outcome.\"",
      "However it doesn't necessarily create long-term benefits, like improvements to memory function. This is because, as Dr Khan explains, the brain is not like a muscle that needs to be flexed to make it grow.",
      "For many years it has been suggested by some that solving puzzles, whether Sudoku or crosswords, can have a hand in slowing cognitive decline or dementia. However this is not necessarily the case.",
      "A study undertaken by Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the University of Aberdeen, and published in the BMJ in 2018, found that people who regularly do intellectual activities throughout life have higher mental abilities, providing a \"higher cognitive point\" from which to decline, but that they do not decline any slower.",

      "A pre-flight inspection of a Jeju Air passenger plane hours before it crashed in South Korea, killing 179 people, found \"no issues\", the airline has said.",
      "\"Nothing abnormal was noted with the landing gear,\" the airline's CEO Kim Yi-bae told a news conference in Seoul, as investigations continue into why the wheels were not down when it performed an emergency landing.",
      "The plane was travelling from Bangkok when it crash-landed at Muan International Airport on Sunday, bursting into flames and killing everyone onboard, save for two crew members, after skidding into a wall.",

      "Many question remain unanswered and investigators are looking at the role a bird strike or weather conditions may have played.",
      "They are also focusing on why the Boeing 737-800 did not have its landing gear down when it hit the runway shortly after 09:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Sunday.",
      "Hundreds of grieving relatives have been camping out at the airport in Muan, furious that they have not yet seen the bodies of their loved ones.",
      "So far just a few of the victims' remains have been released to their families. On Tuesday, four were transported to funeral homes but most other families are still waiting for their loved ones to be identified.",
      "Addressing questions over the company's safety procedures on Tuesday, Jeju Air's CEO Kim Yi-bae said the plane would not have been cleared for takeoff if the maintenance team had not signed off on its safety.",
      "He said its pilots were trained to regulation standards, and the company had two full flight simulators.",
      "\"We have 12.9 maintenance workers per aeroplane, which has increased from 12 in 2019,\" he said.",

      "\"As for whether the landing gear functioned properly, that is directly related to the accident investigation, and we are not in a position to know at this time.\"",
      "Mr Kim said the airline would reduce its air traffic this winter by 10-15%, in order to be able to carry out more maintenance work on the planes, but said this was not an admission that the company was running too many planes.",
      "He added that they would increase their monitoring of weather before and after flights.",
      "Mr Kim also acknowledged that over the past five years, Jeju Air had paid the most fines and faced the most administrative action of any Korean airline \u2013 but said the company was consistently improving its safety record.",
      "He said he was committed to strengthening the company's safety and maintenance procedures, adding: \"We aim to repair your trust in us by strengthening our safety measures.\"",

      "The money would be released soon, he said, before the insurance process is completed. He added that company employees are on site to provide psychological counselling to the families.",
      "The 179 passengers on flight 7C2216 were aged between three and 78 years old, although most were in their 40s, 50s and 60s, according to Yonhap news agency. Two Thai nationals are among the dead and the rest are believed to be South Korean, authorities have said.",
      "Many relatives are frustrated with how long the process of identifying victims' bodies has taken, but officials say it is challenging because those on board were so severely burned in the fire after the crash.",
      "One man the BBC spoke to at the airport said his nephew and his nephew's two sons had been on a celebratory trip to Thailand to mark the end of the college entrance exams. All three died on the flight.",
      "\"I can't believe the entire family has just disappeared,\" Maeng Gi-su, 78, told the BBC. \"My heart aches so much.\"",
      "The runway at Muan International Airport is to stay closed for another week while forensic teams collect more of the remains and debris.",
      "Investigators began inspecting the plane's two black boxes - the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder - on Tuesday.",
      "The second device is missing a critical connector, they say, which will make it more difficult to extract the data. This could prolong the search for answers as to why this plane was forced to land without its landing gear.",
      "Officials also said they are examining regulations around a concrete barrier which the plane smashed into when it skidded beyond the end of the runway.",
      "Meanwhile, New Year celebrations in South Korea have been either cancelled or scaled back as the country observes a week of national mourning for the victims of the tragedy.",

      "According to the Maeil Business Newspaper, Hyundai Cruise went ahead with a fireworks show on a cruise ship on the Han River citing difficulty in cancelling the pre-booked event.",
      "The company apologised amid the public backlash, and the suspension order means that the company will be barred from operating cruise ships on the Han River until June."

    "summary": "The pair were married for two years - but it has taken four times that time to reach a divorce deal.",
    "story": [
      "Arguably the modern era's biggest A-list couple, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were married for two years - but it has taken eight years since announcing their divorce to finally reach a deal. Why did it take four times as long as the marriage itself to settle?",
      "One part of the answer is that it's a particularly messy divorce, complicated by  bitter legal disputes involving their children and a French vineyard they bought together.",
      "Some of that still needs to be resolved in what Jolie's lawyer has called \"a long ongoing process\".",
      "Celebrity lawyer Chris Melcher told BBC News the divorce settlement had taken an unusually long time.",
      "\"This is much longer than any divorce we typically see,\" he said.",
      "\"But they initially had fights over custody and then it revolved around this winery they own together, and that's been the focus of their fight over the last few years.\"",
      "Many celebrities want to divorce quickly and move on, Melcher explained.",
      "\"A lot of times in a case of this magnitude we can settle it within six months, a year at the very most. Eight years is really a sign of something more going on.",
      "\"It's an inability to let go and a desire to really harm the other.\"",
      "Kate Daly, co-founder of online divorce company Amicable, told the BBC that such a case was very different from an average divorce.",
      "\"It's an industry... [they can afford] lots of expensive lawyers,\" she said. \"Most people couldn't afford for it to take eight years. It's an industry and it's a bad example - we have to distance [normal] people from that kind of narrative.\"",
      "Romantic beginning",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, got together after meeting on the set of the film Mr & Mrs Smith, which was released in 2005.",
      "\"Because of the film, we ended up being brought together to do all these crazy things, and I think we found this strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly happened,\" Jolie told Vogue in 2007.",
      "Both had been married before - Pitt to Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie to actors Jonny Lee Miller (1996 to 2000) and Billy Bob Thornton (2000 to 2003).",
      "Jolie and Pitt share six children together.",
      "Jolie adopted Maddox from Cambodia in 2002 a few months after he was born. Pitt later adopted him after he and Jolie had begun their relationship.",
      "In 2005, the pair adopted daughter Zahara from Ethiopia when she was a few months old.",
      "The couple's first biological child, Shiloh, was born in Namibia in 2006. Earlier this year, it was reported that Shiloh had submitted a petition to a court to drop Pitt from her name.",
      "Their son Pax was adopted at the age of three from Vietnam in 2007, and twins Knox and Vivienne were born in 2008.",
      "Beginning of the end",
      "The couple made their final red carpet appearance together in November 2015 for a film they both starred in, By the Sea. It was about an unhappily married couple, and was written and directed by Jolie.",
      "The couple rarely discussed their relationship but when promoting the film, Jolie told The Telegraph: \"Brad and I have our issues.",
      "\"We have fights and problems like any other couple. We have days when we drive each other absolutely mad and want space, but the problems in the movie aren't our specific problems.\"",
      "The news that Jolie was filing for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\", came as a shock to many in September 2016.",
      "'Vitriolic hatred'",
      "It emerged that she filed for divorce a day after an incident on board a private plane.",
      "Pitt was initially alleged to have hit son Maddox, then 15, on the flight from France to Los Angeles. The FBI and social workers examined the claims, but neither took any action. Pitt denied wrongdoing.",
      "Then in 2022, legal papers from the vineyard dispute revealed that Jolie accused Pitt of drunkenly attacking her and two children during the flight.",
      "At the time, a source close to the actor told the BBC that her claims were false.",
      "Speaking to Vogue in 2020, Jolie said she left Pitt for the \"wellbeing\" of her family.",
      "\"It was the right decision,\" she said. \"I continue to focus on their healing.\"",
      "In an interview with GQ in 2017, Pitt spoke about his decision to quit drinking and smoking marijuana, saying the split had been a \"huge generator for change\".",
      "Regarding the divorce, Pitt said he and Jolie had decided to abandon a path of \"vitriolic hatred\" and work together to sort out their issues, adding that they were committed to resolving matters amicably and privately.",
      "Custody battle",
      "Their attempts to reach agreements over the divorce and custody of their children appeared to be acrimonious and protracted.",
      "In 2019, a judge declared that the couple were officially single, but that the divorce still needed to be finalised.",
      "They reached a custody deal in 2018, but that appeared to fall apart. In 2021, Pitt was granted joint custody after a court battle, but the private judge who oversaw the case was later removed because he did not disclose his business relationships with Pitt's lawyers.",
      "That raised the prospect of a fresh custody case, but nothing has been made public.",
      "And while the divorce saga may now be drawing to a close, there is another legal battle still ongoing - to do with the vineyard.",
      "Pitt and Jolie bought Chateau Miraval together in 2008 and got married in its small chapel in 2014.",
      "But Jolie sold her share to a spirits manufacturer owned by a Russian oligarch, according to Pitt's lawsuit. He is suing his ex-wife for selling her stake in the estate, saying they agreed not to sell their shares without the permission of the other. Jolie has not publicly commented.",
      "Emotional fallout",
      "Few details of the divorce proceedings have been revealed. Private judges are often hired in the US to mediate disputes between divorcing celebrities for privacy reasons.",
      "Their children are now all aged between 16 and 23, and showbiz journalist Jeanne Wolf emphasised the emotional fallout.",
      "\"It's been a very emotional and complicated divorce settlement. It's taken a big toll on the children and the couple involved,\" she said.",
      "\"They have tried very hard not to let too many details known about what went on in that marriage.\"",
      "Jolie's lawyer highlighted the passage of time in his statement on Monday. \"This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago,\" he said.",

    "summary": "More could follow before the window to lodge appeals closes at midnight on 30 December.",
    "story": [
      "Dominique Pelicot, the 72-year-old man who drugged and raped his wife Gis\u00e8le and recruited dozens of men to rape her over a decade, will not appeal against his 20-year jail sentence, his lawyer B\u00e9atrice Zavarro said.",
      "However, 17 of the 49 men who were convicted of raping or sexually assaulting Ms Pelicot at Dominique's behest have said they will appeal.",
      "More could follow before the window to lodge appeals closes at midnight on 30 December.",
      "Ms Zavarro told French media that Dominique Pelicot - who admitted his guilt - had decided not to appeal as he did not want to inflict a \"new ordeal\" on Ms Pelicot, who attended court for the vast majority of the 15-week-long trial.",
      "\"He felt that this decision was in line with the position he had always taken in the trial, namely that Ms Pelicot was not and never had been his adversary,\" Ms Zavarro said, adding that Dominique Pelicot wanted to be \"done\" with this case.",
      "He will need to be present in court as a witness during the appeals trial.",
      "Although Ms Pelicot is under no obligation to attend the proceedings, her lawyer St\u00e9phane Babonneau told French media that she would \"face those who appealed. She's not scared of that, although she obviously would have rather it ended here.\"",
      "Under French law, a new trial will have to be held over the next 12 months. However, unlike the first trial, it will be judged by three magistrates and a jury made up of nine members of the public.",
      "While this will not necessarily result in harsher sentences, the trial's huge resonance and media coverage may mean the jury ends up being less lenient than the judges.",
      "Although they will be closely vetted, \"members of the jury are humans like you and I and may well have preconceptions,\" lawyer Hansu Yalaz told the BBC.",

      "Dominique Pelicot: Who is the man who plotted his wife's mass rape?",
      "Among the men who have appealed are Charly Arbo, now 30, who was sentenced to 13 years in jail for raping Ms Pelicot on six separate occasions when he was in his early 20s.",
      "Construction worker Simon\u00e9 Mekenese, 43, and nurse Redouane El Farihi, 55, who were sentenced to nine and eight years respectively, have also appealed.",
      "Many of the men argued they were \"manipulated\" by Pelicot into raping his wife, and that they were not aware she had not given her consent.",
      "\"Since the start, my client has said he... never meant to rape Gisele Pelicot,\" said Mekenese's lawyer Yannick Prat, adding that the nine-year jail sentence was \"disproportionate\".",
      "He admitted the prospect of facing a popular jury could result in a heftier sentence, but said he would be \"absolutely happy\" to work with jurors.",
      "\"I will ask them to put themselves in the shoes of every party in this trial,\" he said.",

      "But other defence lawyers feel that an appeal would be a risky gamble.",
      "On the day the verdicts were handed down, lawyer Patrick Gontard told the BBC that while appeals are usually lodged in the hope of shaving off a few years from a jail sentence, all the men - including his client - had already been handed lighter sentences than had been asked by prosecutor.",
      "Dominique Pelicot - who his daughter Caroline once called \"one of the worst sexual predators of the last 20 years\" - drugged, raped and incited others to rape his wife Gis\u00e8le for at least a decade.",
      "He filmed many of the rapes, which allowed investigators to track down dozens of men. Fifty were eventually arrested, but about 20 individuals were never identified and are believed to be still at large.",
      "The court found 47 of the men guilty of rape, two guilty of attempted rape, and two guilty of sexual assault.",
      "Six men were allowed to walk free from court, in most cases because of the time they had already spent in pre-trial detention.",
      "The proceedings - which lasted from September to December - garnered worldwide attention thanks to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",
      "She said she did so in order to help other victims of rape: \"I want them to say: if Madame Pelicot did it, I can too.\"",

    "story": [
      "On a bright January morning in 1979, then US president Jimmy Carter greeted a historic guest in Washington: Deng Xiaoping, the man who unlocked China's economy.",
      "The first leader of Communist China to visit the United States, Deng had arrived the previous evening, to light snow and a welcome by the US vice-president, the secretary of state and their spouses.",
      "It was the start of a diplomatic relationship that would forever change the world, setting the stage for China's economic ascent - and later, its rivalry with the US.",
      "Establishing formal ties with China was among Carter's more remarkable legacies, during a turbulent presidency that ended with one term.",
      "Born on 1 October, the same date as the founding of the People's Republic of China, \"he liked to say it was destiny that brought him and China together\", said Yawei Liu, a close friend of Carter's.",
      "Even after leaving office, he painstakingly cultivated a close bond with the Chinese people - but that was affected as ties between Washington and Beijing cooled.",
      "Yet he remains one of a small group of US statesmen cherished by Beijing for helping to bring Communist China out of isolation in the 1970s.",
      "Beijing has expressed its condolences, calling Carter the \"driving force\" behind the 1979 agreement. But the Chinese internet has gone much further, referring to him as \"Meirenzong\" or the \"benevolent American\", giving him a title that was once reserved for emperors.",

      "Wooing Beijing",
      "Carter's first encounter with China was in 1949, while the country was suffering the final convulsions of a bloody decades-long civil war.",
      "As a young US naval officer, his submarine unit was dispatched to Qingdao in eastern China. They were to aid Kuomintang troops who were fending off a Communist siege by Mao Zedong's army.",
      "Just kilometres away behind enemy lines was a Chinese commander named Deng Xiaoping.",
      "When they finally met decades later, it was as leaders of their respective countries.",
      "It was an earlier US President, Richard Nixon, and his secretary of state Henry Kissinger who had laid the groundwork for wooing what was then Mao's China. With Beijing and Moscow at loggerheads, they had sensed an opportunity to draw away a Soviet ally.",
      "But those efforts culminated under Carter - and Deng - who pushed for deeper ties. For months, the US president dispatched trusted negotiators for secret talks with Beijing.",
      "The breakthrough came in late 1978. In the middle of December, the two countries announced that they would \"recognise each other and establish diplomatic relations from January 1, 1979\".",
      "The world was surprised and Beijing was elated, but the island of Taiwan, which had long relied on US support against Chinese claims, was crushed. Carter is still a controversial figure there.",
      "Previously, the US had only recognised the government of Taiwan, which China viewed as a renegade province. And for years US support for Taiwan had been the sticking point in negotiations.",
      "Switching recognition to Beijing meant the US had finally acknowledged China's position that there was only one Chinese government - and it was in Beijing. This is the One China policy, which, to this day, forms the cornerstone of US-China relations.",
      "But the pivot raised inevitable questions about US commitment to its allies. Uneasy with Carter's decision, Congress eventually forced through a law codifying its right to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons, thus creating a lasting contradiction in US foreign policy.",
      "Still historians agree that 1979 signalled an extraordinary set of moves that reoriented global power: not only did it unite the US and China against the Soviet Union, but also paved the way for peace and rapid economic growth in East Asia.",
      "A 'unique' friendship",
      "But Carter could not have done it without his special relationship with Deng Xiaoping. \"It's a pleasure to negotiate with him,\" Carter wrote in his diary after spending a day with Deng during his January visit, according to Deng's biographer Ezra Vogel.",
      "\"The two of them followed common sense, there were actually significant similarities in their no-nonsense personalities,\" said Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago. \"There was something really unique between the two men that really established trust.\"",
      "Deng Xiaoping had survived three political purges under Mao to emerge as one of China's most consequential leaders. Historians credit his vision, self-assurance, frankness and sharp wit in no small part for this crucial diplomatic win.",
      "He sensed the opportunity Carter offered, Vogel writes - to both thwart Soviet power and to kickstart the modernisation that had begun in Japan, Taiwan and even South Korea. He knew it would elude China without US help.",
      "Deng's visit to the US began with a warm first meeting at the White House, where he chuckled while revealing his Qingdao connection to Carter, according to Chinese reports. He was exuberant as the two clasped hands in front of cameras in the Rose Garden, saying: \"Now our two countries' peoples are shaking hands.\"",
      "Over the next few days, Deng staged a whirlwind charm offensive on the Americans as he toured several states with Carter. In one famous image, Deng is seen grinning as he dons a cowboy hat at a Texan rodeo. \"Deng avoids politics, goes Texan,\" read a local newspaper headline.",
      "Carter described Deng as \"smart, tough, intelligent, frank, courageous, personable, self-assured, friendly\", according to Vogel.",
      "He later wrote in his diary the trip was \"one of the delightful experiences of my Presidency\u2026 to me, everything went right, and the Chinese leader seemed equally pleased.\"",
      "\"Carter was really a catalytic agent for what was more than a diplomatic rapprochement - it was a dramatic moment of signalling,\" said Orville Schell, the director of the Asia Society's Centre on US-China Relations who, as a journalist in 1979, covered Deng's trip.",
      "\"He introduced Deng to the country and actually to the world. It made what had been a contentious relationship to something very congenial. The way Carter and Deng interacted, these were signals that it was okay to both peoples to set history aside and start a new relationship.\"",
      "Under Carter, China was granted \"most favoured nation\" trade status, boosting its economy and creating jobs. Within a year, two-way trade between the two countries doubled.",
      "Throughout the next decade China became an important trade partner not just for the US but also the world, which was \"extraordinarily important\" for China's growth, noted Prof Yang.",
      "A lifelong connection",
      "Carter's connection with China endured long after his presidency ended.",
      "In the 1990s his non-profit group The Carter Center played a significant role in China's nascent grassroots democracy where - on the invitation of the Chinese government - it observed village elections, trained officials and educated voters.",
      "Unusually for a former US president, Carter returned several times to China on personal visits. On one trip, he and his wife Rosalynn helped to build shelters for victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.",
      "His commitment to humanitarian work, his humble background as the son of a peanut farmer, and \"folksy style\" - which stood in contrast to the formal public personas of Chinese leaders - endeared him to many Chinese, according to Prof Yang: \"He will be seen as a role model of a leader who cares, not just in rhetoric but also in actions.\"",
      "\"Everywhere he travelled in China, people showed their warm feelings for him\u2026 The Chinese people really liked him for his courage and his honesty,\" said Dr Liu, a senior adviser with the Carter Center. He accompanied Carter on several trips, including a 2014 tour where he was f\u00eated by local officials and universities.",
      "In Qingdao, the city put on a surprise fireworks show for his 90th birthday. In Beijing, Deng's daughter hosted  a banquet and presented a gift - a copy of the People's Daily front page of the 1979 communique. \"Both were moved to tears,\" Dr Liu recalled.",
      "That was to be his last visit. As the US-China relationship grew rockier, so too did Carter's ties with the Chinese leadership, particularly after Xi Jinping took power.",
      "On the eve of his 2014 visit, top government officials instructed universities not to sponsor his events, prompting a last-minute scramble to change venues, Carter noted.",
      "A state dinner held for him at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing was sparsely attended, recalled Mr Schell. Notably, it was hosted by then vice-president Li Yuanchao, while Xi was said to be entertaining another dignitary elsewhere in the complex.",
      "\"He wouldn't even come to tip his hat to Carter. That really showed the state of relations,\" Mr Schell said. \"Carter was really very angry. Two of his aides told me he even felt like leaving early because he felt disrespected.\"",
      "The Carter Center's activities in China were eventually curtailed, and a website they maintained to document the village elections was taken offline. No clear explanation was given at the time, but Dr Liu attributed this to China's growing suspicion of foreign organisations following the 2010 Arab Spring.",
      "Though Carter said little about the snub publicly, it would have been felt no less acutely, given the lengths he had gone to advocate for engagement.",
      "It has also raised questions whether his approach on human rights with China - he characterised it as \"patience\" but others criticised it as soft-pedalling - was justified in the end.",
      "Carter often \"made a tremendous effort\u2026 not to stick fingers into China's eyes on the human rights question,\" Mr Schell noted. \"He did temper himself even when he was out of office, as The Carter Center had a real stake in the country.\"",
      "Some see his decision to engage with Communist China as born out of an American sincerity at the time. Following the violent chaos of the Cultural Revolution, there was \"a disbelief among many Americans - how could the Chinese be living in angry isolation?\" Prof Yang said. \"There was a genuine desire among American leaders to really help.\"",
      "Others say that in attempting to shore up support against the Soviets, the US set the course for China's rise and ended up creating one of its greatest rivals.",
      "But these actions also benefited millions of Chinese, helping to lift them out of poverty and - for a time - widening political freedom at the local level.",
      "\"I think all of us from that generation were children of engagement,\" Mr Schell said. \"We were hoping Carter would find the formula that would slowly bring China into a comfortable relationship with [the] US and the rest of the world.\"",
      "Toward the end of his life, Carter grew more alarmed about the growing distrust between the US and China, and frequently warned of a possible \"modern Cold War\".",
      "\"In 1979, Deng Xiaoping and I knew we were advancing the cause of peace. While today's leaders face a different world, the cause of peace remains just as important,\" he wrote on the 40th anniversary of normalisation of relations.",
      "\"[Leaders] must accept our conviction that the United States and China need to build their futures together, for themselves and for humanity at large.\"",

    "summary": "An air safety expert says lives could have been saved if the \"obstruction\" was not there.",
    "story": [
      "Aviation experts have raised questions about an \"unusual\" concrete wall near the runway and its role in the South Korea plane crash that killed 179 people.",
      "Footage shows the Jeju Air plane coming off the runway before colliding with the wall and bursting into flames at Muan International Airport on Sunday.",
      "Authorities investigating the cause of South Korea's worst-ever plane crash are considering the significance of the concrete wall's location about 250m (820ft) off the end of the runway.",
      "Air safety expert David Learmount said that, had the \"obstruction\" not been there, the plane \"would have come to rest with most - possibly all - those on board still alive\".",
      "The pilot reported that the plane had struck a bird and then aborted the original landing and requested permission to land from the opposite direction.",
      "The plane came down some distance along the 2,800m runway and appeared to land without using its wheels or any other landing gear.",
      "Mr Learmount said the landing was \"as good as a flapless/gearless touchdown could be: wings level, nose not too high to avoid breaking the tail\" and the plane had not sustained substantial damage as it slid along the runway.",
      "\"The reason so many people died was not the landing as such, but the fact that the aircraft collided with a very hard obstruction just beyond the runway end,\" he said.",
      "Another aviation analyst agreed. Captain Ross Aimer, chief executive of Aero Consulting Experts, told Reuters news agency: \"Unfortunately, that thing was the reason that everybody got killed, because they literally hit a concrete structure. It shouldn't have been there.\"",
      "Christian Beckert, a Lufthansa pilot based in Munich, called the concrete structure \"unusual\", saying: \"Normally, on an airport with a runway at the end, you don't have a wall.\"",
      "The concrete structure holds a navigation system that assists aircraft landings - known as a localiser - according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency.",
      "At 4m high, it is covered with dirt and was raised to keep the localiser level with the runway to ensure it functions properly, Yonhap reported.",
      "South Korea's transport ministry has said that other airports in the country and some overseas have the equipment installed with concrete structures. However officials will examine whether it should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "Chris Kingswood, a pilot with 48 years' experience who has flown the same type of aircraft involved in the crash, told BBC News: \"Obstacles within a certain range and distance of the runway are required to be frangible, which means that if an aircraft strikes them that they do break.",
      "\"It does seem unusual that it's such a rigid thing. The aircraft, from what I understand, was travelling very fast, landed a long way down the runway, so it will have gone a long way past the end of the runway... so where will you draw the line with that? That's certainly something that will be investigated.",
      "\"Aeroplanes are not strong structures - they are, by design, light to make them efficient in flight. They're not really designed to go high-speed on its belly so any kind of structure could cause the fuselage to break up and then be catastrophic.",

      "\"So it's not a given that if the wall had not been there, it would have been a completely different outcome.\"",
      "Mr Kingswood said he would be \"surprised if the airfield hadn't met all the requirements in accordance with industry standards\".",
      "\"I suspect if we went around the airfields at a lot of major international airports... we would find a lot of obstacles that could similarly be accused of presenting a hazard,\" he added.",
      "However former pilot John Cox, chief executive of Safety Operating Systems, said the runway design \"absolutely (did) not\" meet industry best practices, which preclude any hard structure within at least 300m (984ft) of the end of the runway.",
      "Following the crash, it emerged that remarks in Muan International Airport's operating manual, uploaded early in 2024, said the concrete embankment was too close to the end of the runway.",
      "The document, prepared by Korea Airports Corp, recommended the location of the equipment be reviewed during a planned expansion.",
      "South Korea's director-general for airport policy, Kim Hong-rak, said the government would \"review the relevant regulations and their application\".",
      "Aviation analyst Sally Gethin questioned whether the pilot knew the barrier was there, particularly given the plane was approaching from the opposite direction from the usual landing approach.",
      "She told BBC News: \"We need to know, were (the pilots) aware there was this hard boundary at the end?",
      "\"If they were directed by the control tower to reverse the use of the runway the second time around, that should come out in the investigation of the black boxes.",
      "\"I think there are so many questions.\"",
      "At a news conference on Tuesday, Jeju Air's chief executive Kim Yi-bae would not be drawn when asked about the concrete wall.",
      "Asked by a reporter if he thought the wall was a factor in the disaster, he did not give a direct answer and instead said it was right to call the plane crash the Jeju Air disaster, rather than the Muan Air disaster."

    "story": [
      "On Christmas Eve, an autonomous spacecraft flew past the Sun, closer than any human-made object before it. Swooping through the atmosphere, Nasa's Parker Solar Probe was on a mission to discover more about the Sun, including how it affects space weather on Earth.",
      "This was a landmark moment for humanity \u2013 but one without any human directly involved, as the spacecraft carried out its pre-programmed tasks by itself as it flew past the sun, with no communication with Earth at all.",
      "Robotic probes have been sent across the solar system for the last six decades, reaching destinations impossible for humans. During its 10-day flyby, the Parker Solar Probe experienced temperatures of 1000C.",
      "But the success of these autonomous spacecraft \u2013 coupled with the rise of new advanced artificial intelligence \u2013 raises the question of what role humans might play in future space exploration.",
      "Some scientists question whether human astronauts are going to be needed at all.",
      "\"Robots are developing fast, and the case for sending humans is getting weaker all the time,\" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal. \"I don't think any taxpayer's money should be used to send humans into space.\"",
      "He also points to the risk to humans.",
      "\"The only case for sending humans [there] is as an adventure, an experience for wealthy people, and that should be funded privately,\" he argues.",
      "Andrew Coates, a physicist from University College London, agrees. \"For serious space exploration, I much prefer robotics,\" he says. \"[They] go much further and do more things.\"",
      "They are also cheaper than humans, he argues. \"And as AI progresses, the robots can be cleverer and cleverer.\"",
      "But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts \u2013 and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could?",
      "Rovers versus mankind",
      "Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon.",
      "In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket).",
      "\"Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,\" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. \"It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant.\"",
      "But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science.",
      "Robots can contribute to that scientific research, with the ability to travel to locations inhospitable to humans, where they can use instruments to study and probe the atmospheres and surfaces.",
      "\"Humans are more versatile and we get stuff done faster than a robot, but we're really hard and expensive to keep alive in space,\" says Dr Weinersmith.",
      "In her 2024 Booker Prize-winning novel Orbital, author Samantha Harvey puts it more lyrically: \"A robot has no need for hydration, nutrients, excretion, sleep\u2026 It wants and asks for nothing.\"",
      "But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical \u2013 for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph.",
      "\"AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?\" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. \"I just don't think we know.\"",
      "He does, however, believe that AI algorithms might enable rovers to be \"more efficient\".",
      "AI assistants and humanoid robots",
      "Technology can play a part in complementing human space travel by freeing up astronauts from certain tasks to allow them to focus on more important research.",
      "\"[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,\" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. \"On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't.\"",
      "The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. \"We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has\" \u2013 meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM.",
      "Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans.",
      "Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities.",
      "Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa's Robonaut was the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans.",
      "Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems.",
      "A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly.",
      "\"If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,\" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. \"We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around.\"",
      "He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them.",
      "Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input.",
      "\"You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep.\"",
      "But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot.",
      "\"Inspiration is something that is intangible,\" argues Prof Coates.",
      "Leroy Chiao, a retired Nasa astronaut who went on three flights to space in the 1990s and 2000s on Nasa's Space Shuttle and to the International Space Station, agrees. \"Humans relate when humans are doing something.",
      "\"The general public is excited about robotic missions. But I would expect the first human on Mars to be even bigger than the first Moon landing.\"",

      "Humans have not travelled further than Earth's orbit since December 1972, when the last Apollo mission visited the Moon. Nasa is hoping to return humans there this decade with its Artemis programme.",
      "The next crewed mission will see four astronauts fly around the Moon in 2026. A further mission, scheduled for 2027, will see Nasa astronauts land on the Moon's surface.",
      "The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon.",
      "Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans could land.",
      "His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to be a million people on Mars in 20 years.",
      "\"Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,\" explains Dr Weinersmith. \"If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary.\"",
      "However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved.",
      "\"Maybe babies can't develop in that environment,\" she says. \"There [are] ethical questions [like this] that we don't have the answers to.",
      "\"I think we should be slowing down.\"",
      "Lord Rees has a vision of his own, though, in which human and robotic exploration might merge to the point that humans themselves are part-machine to cope with extreme environments. \"I can imagine they will use all of the techniques of genetic modification, cyborg add-ons, and so on, to cope with very hostile environments,\" he says.",
      "\"We may have a new species that will be happy to live on Mars.\"",

      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine is losing the battle on the ground. Many of its soldiers are tired and exhausted after three years of fighting. The question \u2013 can the country endure another year of war?",
      "Their forces are still resisting Russian advances in the east. But they're almost surrounded near the town of Kurakhove \u2013 scene to some of the most intense fighting in recent weeks.",
      "The Black Pack, a mortar unit, is trying to prevent their encirclement around Kurakhove. The Russian are closing in on three sides.",
      "We meet the team at a safe house, getting a rest from the fighting. They're not your average soldiers. They include a vegan chef, a mechanic, a web developer and an artist. A group of friends with non-conformist views. Some call themselves anarchists. They all volunteered to fight.",
      "Surt, their 31-year-old commander, joined the army soon after Russia's full scale invasion. He tells me at the start he thought the war would last three years. Now, he says, he's mentally preparing himself for another ten years of fighting.",
      "They all know that Donald Trump wants to bring an end to the war. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and Russia's president have indicated they're prepared for talks too, but the idea of workable deal seems hard to imagine.",
      "So far, it is just talk about talks.",
      "Surt is not dismissive of Trump's goal.",
      "\"He is quite an ambitious person and I think he will try to do it,\" he says. But he worries about the outcome of any negotiations.",
      "\"We are realists, we understand there will be no justice for Ukraine \u2013 many will have to swallow the fact that their homes are destroyed by rockets and shells, that their loved ones were killed, and this will be hard.\"",
      "When I ask him whether he'd prefer to negotiate or to keep on fighting \u2013 Surt replies emphatically: \"Keep fighting.\"",
      "It's a view reflected by most of the unit. Serhiy, the vegan chef, believes negotiations would just temporarily freeze the war \u2013 \"and the conflict will return in a year or two.\"",
      "He admits the current situation is \"not good\" for Ukraine. But he too is ready to carry on fighting. Being killed, he says, \"is just an occupational hazard.\"",
      "Davyd, the artist, thinks Trump is worryingly unpredictable. \"He could be either very good or very bad for Ukraine,\" he says.",
      "The unit spends a week on the front and the next resting. But even when they're resting they continue to train, because, they say, it keeps them motivated.",
      "In a freezing field they go through the drills for firing their mortars. The team have recently been joined by Denys, who voluntarily left the safety of his home in Germany.",
      "\"I asked myself the question - could I live in a world where Ukraine doesn't exist?\" he says. He reluctantly admits it now appears to be losing, but adds: \"If you don't try then you will most certainly lose. At least I'll die trying to win instead of just lying down and taking it\".",
      "But, unlike the others, Denys says he thinks Ukraine should at least consider a ceasefire. He thinks Ukraine's casualties are higher than those officially admitted \u2013 more than 400,000 killed and injured. Mobilising more of the population, he believes, wouldn't solve the problem.",
      "\"I just think a lot of the motivated soldiers are either lost or they're pretty damn exhausted \u2013 and so for me it's not that we want a ceasefire, but we can't go on for many more years\" he says.",
      "Dnipro, Ukraine's third largest city,  reflects that sense of war weariness too. It's regularly targeted by Russian missiles and drones. The air-raid sirens wail intermittently, day and night. When they're silent, Ukrainians try to find some sense of normality in these abnormal times \u2013 including by going to the theatre.",
      "At an afternoon performance of a humorous play, called The Kaidash Family, there are still reminders of the war \u2013 a minute's silence to remember the fallen, followed by Ukraine's national anthem.",

      "Kseniia says: \"There's no easy answer. A lot of our soldiers have been killed. They fought for something - for our territories. But I want the war to end\".",
      "Opinion polls too suggest there's increasing support for negotiations.",
      "Some of the strongest calls for a ceasefire come from those who've been forced to flee the fighting. In a shelter near the theatre, in former student accommodation, a group of four elderly women reminisce about the homes they've left behind.",
      "Eighty-seven-year-old Valentyna says they arrived with nothing, but have been provided with shoes, clothes and food. She says they've been treated well. \"It's good to be a guest, but its better to be at home.\"",
      "Her home is now in Russian-occupied territory. All four women want negotiations for peace. But Mariia, 89, says she doesn't know how either side will be able to \"look into the eyes of each other after the sheer hell they've committed\".",
      "She adds: \"It's already clear no one will win militarily, that is why we need negotiations.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:04:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Hurricane Beryl lashed the island in July, devastating much of its fishing fleet.",
    "story": [
      "There are few clearer signs of the destructive power that Hurricane Beryl unleashed on Barbados in July than the scene at the temporary boatyard in the capital, Bridgetown.",
      "Scores of mangled and cracked vessels sit on stacks, gaping holes in their hulls, their rudders snapped off and cabin windows broken.",
      "Yet these were the lucky ones.",
      "At least they can be repaired and put back out to sea. Many others sank, taking entire family incomes with them.",
      "When Beryl lashed Barbados, the island's fishing fleet was devastated in a matter of hours. About 75% of the active fleet was damaged, with 88 boats totally destroyed.",
      "Charles Carter, who owns a blue-and-black fishing vessel called Joyce, was among those affected.",
      "\"It's been real bad, I can tell you. I had to change both sides of the hull, up to the waterline,\" he says, pointing at the now pristine boat in front of us.",
      "It has taken months of restoration and thousands of dollars to get it back to this point, during which time Charles has barely been able to fish.",
      "\"That's my living, my livelihood, fishing is all I do,\" he says.",
      "\"The fishing industry is mash up,\" echoes his friend, Captain Euride. \"We're just trying to get back the pieces.\"",
      "Now, six months after the storm, there are signs of calmer waters. On a warm Saturday, several repaired vessels were put back into the ocean with the help of a crane, a trailer and some government support.",
      "Seeing Joyce back on the water is a welcome sight for all fishermen in Barbados.",
      "But Barbadians are acutely aware that climate change means more active and powerful Atlantic hurricane seasons - and it may be just another year or two before the fishing industry is struck again. Beryl, for example, was the earliest-forming Category 5 storm on record.",
      "Few understand the extent of the problem better than the island's Chief Fisheries Officer, Dr Shelly Ann Cox.",
      "\"Our captains have been reporting that sea conditions have changed,\" she explains. \"Higher swells, sea surface temperatures are much warmer and they're having difficulty getting flying fish now at the beginning of our pelagic season.\"",
      "The flying fish is a national symbol in Barbados and a key part of the island's cuisine. But climate change has been harming the stocks for years.",
      "At the Oistins Fish Market in Bridgetown, flying fish are still available, along with marlin, mahi-mahi and tuna, though only a handful of stalls are open.",
      "At one of them, Cornelius Carrington, from the Freedom Fish House. fillets a kingfish with the speed and dexterity of a man who has spent many years with a fish knife in his hands.",
      "\"Beryl was like a surprise attack, like an ambush,\" says Cornelius, in a deep baritone voice, over the market's chatter, reggae and thwack of cleavers on chopping boards.",
      "Cornelius lost one of his two boats in Hurricane Beryl. \"It's the first time a hurricane has come from the south like that, normally storms hit us from the north,\" he said.",
      "Although his second boat allowed him to stay afloat financially, Cornelius thinks the hand of climate change is increasingly present in the fishermen's fate.",
      "\"Right now, everything has changed. The tides are changing, the weather is changing, the temperature of the sea, the whole pattern has changed.\"",
      "The effects are also being felt in the tourism industry, he says, with hotels and restaurants struggling to find enough fish to meet demand each month.",
      "For Dr Shelly Ann Cox, public education is key and, she says, the message is getting through.",
      "\"Perhaps because we are an island and we're so connected to the water, people in Barbados can speak well on the impact on climate change and what that means for our country,\" she says.",
      "\"I think if you speak to children as well, they're very knowledgeable about the topic.\"",
      "To see for myself, I visited a secondary school \u2013 Harrison College \u2013 as a member of a local NGO, the Caribbean Youth Environmental Network (CYEN), talked to members of the school's Environmental Club about climate change.",
      "The CYEN representative, Sheldon Marshall, is an energy expert who quizzed the pupils about greenhouse gases and the steps they could take at home to help reduce carbon emissions on the island.",
      "\"How can you, as young people in Barbados, help make a difference on climate change?\" he asked them.",
      "Following an engaging and lively debate, I asked the pupils how they felt about Barbados being on the front line of global climate change, despite having only a small carbon footprint itself.",
      "\"Personally, I take a very pessimistic view,\" said 17-year-old Isabella Fredricks.",
      "\"We are a very small country. No matter how hard we try to change, if the big countries \u2013 the main producers of pollution like America, India and China \u2013 don't make a change, everything we do is going to be pointless.\"",
      "Her classmate, Tenusha Ramsham, is slightly more optimistic.",
      "\"I think that all great big leaps in history were made when people collaborated and innovated,\" she argues. \"I don't think we should be completely disheartened because research, innovation, creating technology and education will ultimately lead to the future that we want.\"",
      "\"I feel if we can communicate to the global superpowers the pain that we feel seeing this happen to our environment,\" adds 16-year-old Adrielle Baird, \"then it would help them to understand and help us collaborate to find ways to fix the issues that we're seeing.\"",
      "For the island's young people, their very futures are at stake. Rising sea levels now pose an existential threat to the small islands of the Caribbean.",
      "It is a point on which the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, has become a global advocate for change \u2013 urging greater action over an impending climate catastrophe in her speech at COP29 and calling for economic compensation from the world's industrialised nations.",
      "On its shores and in its seas, it feels like Barbados is under siege - dealing with issues from coral bleaching to coastal erosion. While the impetus for action comes from the island's youth, it is the older generations who have borne witness as the changes unfold.",
      "Steven Bourne has fished the waters around Barbados his whole life and lost two boats in Hurricane Beryl. As we look out at the coastline from a dilapidated beach-hut bar, he says the island's sands have shifted before his very eyes.",
      "\"It's an attack from the elements. You see it taking the beaches away, but years ago you'd be sitting here, and you could see the water's edge coming upon the sand. Now you can't because the sand's built up so much.\"",
      "By coincidence, in the same bar where I chatted to Steven was Home Affairs Minister Wilfred Abrahams, who has responsibility for national disaster management.",
      "I put it to him that it must be a a difficult time for disaster management in the Caribbean.",
      "\"The whole landscape has changed entirely,\" he replied. \"Once upon a time, it was rare to get a Category Five hurricane in any year. Now we're getting them every year. So the intensity and the frequency are cause for concern.\"",
      "Even the duration of the hurricane season has changed, he says.",
      "\"We used to have a rhyme that went: June, too soon; July, standby; October, all over,\" he tells me. Extreme weather events like Beryl have rendered such an idea obsolete.",
      "\"What we can expect has changed, what we've prepared for our whole lives and what our culture is built around has changed,\" he adds.",
      "Fisherman Steven Bourne had hoped to retire before Beryl. Now, he says, he and the rest of the islanders have no choice but to keep going.",
      "\"Being afraid or anything like that don't make no sense. Because there's nowhere for we to go. We love this rock. And we will always be on this rock.\"",

      "They also need specific climatic conditions like humid temperatures and ample rainfall to grow.",
      "\"Climate change is a major challenge for our coffee farmers,\" says John Murigi, the chairman of the Komothai Coffee Society, which represents 8,000 coffee farmers like Mr Macharia.",
      "Cold temperatures and erratic rainfall are having a devastating impact on the delicate coffee plants, said Mr Murigi.",
      "As a result, \"coffee production has decreased over the last few years\".",
      "He added that climate change was intensifying the spread of diseases in coffee plants.",
      "Mr Murigi said there had been a significant increase in coffee leaf miners, bugs that feed on coffee leaves, and coffee berry disease, a destructive fungal infection that can wipe out more than 80% of crops.",
      "To deal with the increasing outbreaks, farmers are resorting to using herbicides and insecticides that can damage soil quality in the long term and also pose health risks.",
      "Farmers use dangerous herbicides like Roundup, which contain glyphosates known to cause cancers - banned in some European countries - to ensure they get a good harvest.",
      "Pest Control Products Board (PCPB) of Kenya, in charge of regulating the use of these products, did not respond to a BBC request for comment.",
      "To produce a single cup of coffee can require up to 140 litres of water - including the water to grow the plants.",
      "But higher temperatures and changing rainfall patterns mean a decreasing water supply for coffee farmers in Kiambu County.",
      "Farmer Joseph Kimani told the BBC that the \"river levels have gone down a lot\" due to erratic weather, such as periods of drought and heavy rains.",
      "He said that because of the lack of rain, farmers are forced to use more river water.",
      "But this increased reliance on river water, driven by the lack of rainfall, may be further straining the already limited water supply.",
      "While Mr Murigi acknowledges the rise in water use by coffee farmers, he denies this is why the river is drying up.",
      "However, with 23 coffee societies in this region, a significant amount of water is clearly being used in the coffee growing process in Kiambu County.",
      "Komothia's story is not unique. As global temperatures and droughts increase, good coffee will become difficult to grow in all parts of the world.",
      "Coffee can only be grown in the \"coffee belt\" - tropical regions around the world in areas typically located at an altitude of between 1,000m and 2,000m.",
      "In recent years, climate change has led to a shortage of global coffee supplies and an increase in the price of coffee due to drought and crop failures in several key coffee-producing nations such as Brazil and Vietnam.",
      "A survey by Fairtrade International, the organisation behind Fairtrade labels, found that 93% of Kenyan coffee farmers are already experiencing the effects of climate change.",
      "The coffee industry in Kenya is a key source of employment, providing jobs for an estimated 150,000 people.",
      "To protect the industry, coffee farmers in areas like Komothai are experimenting with climate adaptation techniques, such as planting trees to provide extra shade for the coffee plants.",
      "Mr Murigi said it is only through addressing both the climate and economic challenges faced by Kenyan coffee farmers that they can have a sustainable future.",
      "However, coffee farmers like Mr Macharia are pessimistic about the industry's future.",
      "\"Right now, as things stand, I don't think any parent wants their child here farming coffee,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Will the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson shock the American system into change?",
    "story": [
      "Special education teacher Robin Ginkel has spent almost two years fighting with her insurance company to try to get it to pay for back surgery that her doctors recommended after a work injury left her with a herniated disc and debilitating pain.",
      "The plan didn't seem \"ridiculous\", she said: \"I'm asking to get healthcare to return to a normal quality of life and return to work.\"",
      "Initially rejected, the 43-year-old from Minnesota spent hours on hold appealing the decision - even lodging a complaint with the state - only to see her claims denied three times.",
      "Now she is bracing for the battle to start again, after deciding her best option was to try her luck with a new insurance company.",
      "\"It's exhausting,\" she said. \"I can't keep going like this.\"",
      "Ms Ginkel is not alone in throwing up her hands.",
      "Roughly one in five Americans covered by private health insurance reported their provider refused to pay for care recommended by a doctor last year, according to a survey by health policy foundation KFF.",
      "Brian Mulhern, a 54-year-old from Rhode Island, said his health insurance firm recently rejected a request to pay for a colonoscopy after polyps were discovered on his colon - a discovery that prompted his doctor to advise a follow-up exam within three years instead of the typical five.",
      "Faced with $900 in out-of-pocket costs, Mr Mulhern put off the procedure.",
      "Long simmering anger about insurance decisions exploded into public view earlier this month after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was murdered - and the killing unleashed a startling wave of public outrage at the industry.",
      "The crime sent shockwaves through the system, prompting one insurance company to reverse a controversial plan to limit anaesthesia coverage, and hit the share prices of major firms.",
      "Though the reaction raised the possibility that scrutiny might force change, experts said addressing the frustration would require action from Washington, where there is little sign of a change in momentum.",
      "On the contrary: just in the last few weeks, Congress again failed to move forward long-stalled measures aimed at making it easier for people on certain government-backed insurance plans to get their claims approved.",
      "Killing of insurance CEO reveals simmering anger at US health system",
      "Who was Brian Thompson, healthcare CEO gunned down in New York?",
      "Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty to murdering healthcare CEO",
      "Many advocates are also concerned about problems worsening, as Donald Trump returns to the White House.",
      "The president-elect has pledged to protect Medicare, which is government health insurance for over-65s and some younger people. He is known for longstanding criticism of parts of the health industry, such as high prices for medicines.",
      "But he has also vowed to loosen regulation, pursue privatisation and add work requirements to publicly available insurance and cut government spending, of which healthcare is a major part.",
      "\"The way things stand today, healthcare is a target,\" said David Lipschutz, co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a non-profit that seeks to advance comprehensive Medicare coverage.",
      "\"They're going to try to take people's health insurance away or diminish people's access to it and that's going in the opposite direction of some of these frustrations and would only make problems worse.\"",
      "Republicans, who control Congress, have historically backed reforms aimed at making the health system more transparent, cutting regulation and reducing the government's role.",
      "\"If you take government bureaucrats out of the healthcare equation and you have doctor-patient relationships, it's better for everybody,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a video obtained by NBC News last month. \"More efficient, more effective,\" he said. \"That's the free market. Trump's going to be for the free market.\"",
      "Unhappiness with the health system is longstanding in the US, where experts - including at KFF - point out that care is more expensive than in other countries and performance is worse on basic metrics such as life expectancy, infant mortality and safety during childbirth.",
      "The US spent more than $12,000 (\u00a39,600) per person on healthcare in 2022 - almost twice the average of other wealthy countries, according to the Peter G Peterson Foundation.",
      "The last major reform, under former president Barack Obama in 2010, focused on expanding health insurance in hopes of making care more accessible.",
      "The law included measures to widen eligibility for Medicaid, another government programme that helps cover medical costs for people with limited incomes. It also forbid insurers from rejecting patients with \"pre-existing conditions\", successfully reducing the share of the population without insurance from about 15% to roughly 8%.",
      "Today, about 40% of the population in the US gets insurance from taxpayer-funded government plans - mostly Medicare and Medicaid - with coverage increasingly contracted out to private companies.",
      "The remainder are enrolled in plans from private companies, which are typically selected by employers and paid for with a mix of personal contributions and employer funds.",
      "Even though more people are covered than ever before, frustrations remain widespread. In a recent Gallup poll, just 28% of respondents rated health care coverage excellent or good, the lowest level since 2008.",
      "Public data on the rate of insurance denials - which can also happen after care has been received, leaving patients with hefty bills - is limited.",
      "But surveys of patients and medical professionals suggest insurance companies are requiring more \"prior authorisation\" for procedures - and rejections by insurance companies are on the rise.",
      "In the state of Maryland, for example, the number of claim denials disclosed by insurers has jumped more than 70% over five years, according to reports from the state attorney general's office.",
      "\"The fact that we pay into the system and then when we need it, we can't access the care we need makes no sense,\" said Ms Ginkel. \"As I went through the process, it felt more and more like [the insurance companies] do this on purpose in hopes you're going to give up.\"",
      "Brian Mulhern, the Rhode Islander who put off his colonoscopy, compared the industry to the \"legal mafia\" - offering protection \"but on their terms\". He added: \"It increasingly seems to be that you can pay more and more and get nothing.\"",
      "AHIP, a lobby group for health insurers, said claims denials often reflected faulty submissions by doctors, or pre-determined decisions about what to cover that had been made by regulators and employers.",
      "UnitedHealthcare did not respond to a BBC request for comment for this article. But in an opinion piece written after the killing of its CEO Brian Thompson, Andrew Witty, head of the firm's parent company, defended the industry's decision-making.",
      "He said it was based on a \"comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety\".",
      "But critics complain that a for-profit health system will always be focused on its shareholders and bottom line, and have linked the surge in claims denial to the rising using of allegedly error-prone artificial intelligence (AI) to review requests.",
      "One developer said last year its AI tool was not being used to inform coverage decisions - only to help guide providers on how to aid patients.",
      "Derrick Crowe, communications and digital director of People's Action, a non-profit that advocates for insurance reform, said he was hopeful the shock of the murder would force change on the industry.",
      "\"This is a moment to take a moment of private pain and turn it into a public collective power to ensure companies stop denying our care,\" he said.",
      "Whether the murder will strengthen appetite for reform remains to be seen.",
      "Politicians from both parties in Washington have expressed interest in efforts that might rein in the industry, such as toughening oversight of algorithms and rules that would require the break-up of big firms.",
      "But there is little sign the proposals have meaningful traction.",
      "Trump's nominee to run the powerful Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), TV doctor Mehmet Oz, has previously endorsed expanding coverage by Medicare Advantage - which offers Medicare health plans through private companies.",
      "\"These plans are popular among seniors, consistently provide quality care and have a needed incentive to keep costs low,\" he explained in 2022.",
      "Prof Buntin said Republican election gains indicate that the US is not about to embrace the alternative - a publicly run scheme like the UK's National Health Service - anytime soon.",
      "\"There's a distrust of people who seem to be profiting or benefiting off of illness - and yet that's the basis of the American system,\" she said."

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 11:16:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Officials are investigating the cause of the deadliest aircraft crash in South Korean history, which killed 179 people.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly 180 people died after a plane crashed as it was landing in South Korea on the morning of Sunday 29 December.",
      "Harrowing video footage shows the Jeju Air plane coming off the runway before colliding with a barrier and bursting into flames at Muan International Airport.",
      "The plane, which was returning from Bangkok, Thailand, was carrying 181 people - 179 of whom were killed. Two crew members were rescued from the wreckage.",
      "Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, with fire officials indicating a bird strike and bad weather. However experts have warned the crash could have been caused by a number of factors.",
      "What happened?",
      "Flight 7C2216 was a Boeing 737-800 operated by Jeju Air, Korea's most popular budget airline.",
      "Air traffic control authorised the plane to land at Muan International Airport at about 08:54 (23:54 GMT) - just three minutes before issuing a warning about bird activity in the area.",
      "Could a bird strike have caused the crash?'It's unbearable': Families criticise lack of updates as investigators search debrisVideo captures moments before crashWatch: At the scene of the investigation",

      "'It's unbearable': Families criticise lack of updates as investigators search debris",
      "Video captures moments before crash",
      "Watch: At the scene of the investigation",
      "At 08:59, the pilot reported that the plane had struck a bird, declaring \"mayday mayday mayday\" and \"bird strike, bird strike, go-around\". The pilot then aborted the original landing and requested permission to land from the opposite direction.",
      "Air traffic control authorised the alternative landing at 09:01 - and at 09:02 the plane made contact with the ground, coming down at roughly the halfway point of the 2,800m runway.",
      "One video appears to show the plane touching down without using its wheels or any other landing gear. It skidded down the runway, overshot it and crashed into a concrete wall, before erupting into flames.",
      "A witness told the South Korean news agency Yonhap they had heard a \"loud bang\" followed by a \"series of explosions\".",
      "Videos from the scene show the plane ablaze with smoke billowing into the sky. The first of two survivors was rescued from the crash at about 09:23, with the second being rescued from inside the tail section of the plane at about 09:50.",
      "Could a bird strike have contributed to the crash?",
      "Lee Jeong-hyun, chief of the Muan fire department, told a televised briefing that a bird strike and bad weather might have caused the crash - but that the exact cause was still being investigated.",
      "The flight and voice recorders from the plane were recovered, though reports say that the former was damaged and that data from the devices could take up to a month to decode.",
      "One passenger on the flight messaged a relative, saying that a bird had been \"stuck in the wing\" and that the plane could not land, local media reported.",
      "Officials, however, have not confirmed whether the plane did actually collide with any birds.",
      "The head of Jeju Air's management said that the crash was not due to \"any maintenance issues\".",
      "The South Korean transport department said that the head pilot on the flight had held the role since 2019 and had more than 6,800 hours of flight experience.",
      "Geoffrey Thomas, an aviation expert and editor of Airline News, told the BBC that South Korea and its airlines were considered \"industry best practice\" and that both the aircraft and the airline had an \"excellent safety record\".",
      "Mr Thomas separately told Reuters news agency that he was sceptical that a bird strike alone could have caused the crash.",
      "\"A bird strike is not unusual. Problems with an undercarriage are not unusual. Bird strikes happen far more often, but typically they don't cause the loss of an airplane by themselves,\" he said.",
      "Who are the plane crash victims and survivors?",
      "The plane was carrying 175 passengers and six crew. Two of the passengers were Thai and the rest are believed to have been South Korean, authorities have said. Many are thought to have been returning from a Christmas holiday in Thailand.",
      "The official death toll stands at 179 - making it the deadliest plane crash on South Korean soil.",
      "All the passengers and four members of crew died.",
      "Authorities have so far identified 174 bodies and are still checking the remaining five \"due to DNA inconsistencies\", according to Yonhap.",
      "Officials have been collecting saliva samples from family members gathered at Muan Airport to help identify bodies of victims. Other victims have been identified by their fingerprints.",
      "Five of the people who died were children under the age of 10. The youngest passenger was a three-year-old boy and the oldest was 78, authorities said, citing the passenger manifest.",
      "\"I can't believe the entire family has just disappeared,\" Maeng Gi-Su, 78, whose nephew and grand-nephews were on the flight, told the BBC. \"My heart aches so much.\"",
      "South Korea's National Fire Agency said two members of the flight crew - a man and a woman - had survived the crash.",
      "The man has woken up and is \"fully able to communicate\", according to Yonhap, which cites the director of the Seoul hospital where he is being treated.",
      "More than 1,500 emergency personnel have been deployed as part of recovery efforts, including 490 fire employees and 455 police officers. They have been searching the area around the runway for parts of the plane and those who were onboard.",
      "Why was there a concrete wall at the end of the runway?",
      "Aviation experts have raised questions about an \"unusual\" concrete wall near the runway and its role in the crash.",
      "Footage shows the plane coming off the runway before colliding with the wall and bursting into flames.",
      "Air safety expert David Learmount said that, had the \"obstruction\" not been there, the plane \"would have come to rest with most - possibly all - those on board still alive\".",
      "\"Unfortunately, that thing was the reason that everybody got killed, because they literally hit a concrete structure,\" Captain Ross Aimer, the chief executive of Aero Consulting Experts, told Reuters news agency. \"It shouldn't have been there.\"",
      "Aviation analyst Sally Gethin questioned whether the pilot knew the barrier was there, particularly given the plane was approaching from the opposite direction from the usual landing approach.",
      "The concrete structure holds a navigation system that assists aircraft landings - known as a localiser - according to Yonhap.",
      "At 4m high, it is covered with dirt and was raised to keep the localiser level with the runway to ensure it functions properly, Yonhap reported.",
      "South Korea's transport ministry has said that other airports in the country and some overseas have the equipment installed with concrete structures. However officials will examine whether it should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "South Korean officials have said the structure was about 250m (820ft) from the end of the runway and most airports in the country follow international rules recommending a safety area of 240m (787ft).",
      "However, remarks in the airport's operating manual, uploaded early in 2024, said the embankment was too close to the end of the runway and recommended that the location of the equipment be reviewed during a planned expansion.",
      "Former pilot John Cox, chief executive of Safety Operating Systems, told Reuters the runway design \"absolutely (did) not\" meet industry best practices, which preclude any hard structure within at least 300m (984ft) of the end of the runway.",
      "South Korea's director-general for airport policy, Kim Hong-rak, said the government would \"review the relevant regulations and their application\".",
      "At a news conference on Tuesday, Jeju Air's chief executive Kim Yi-bae appeared to sidestep a question about the wall.",
      "Asked by a reporter if he thought the wall was a factor in the disaster, he did not give a direct answer and instead said it was right to call the plane crash the Jeju Air disaster, rather than the Muan Air disaster.",
      "What has the airline said?",
      "Speaking on Tuesday, Jeju Air's chief executive said the airline would reduce its air traffic this winter by 10-15% to carry out more maintenance work.",
      "But Kim Yi-bae said this was not an admission that the company was running too many planes.",
      "No issues were brought to light when the plane was inspected on the day of the crash - and the airline was monitoring the weather both before and after the flight, he added.",
      "Mr Kim said a different Jeju flight faced issues with its landing gear on Monday and was forced to return to Seoul's international airport but it has been declared safe.",
      "He said the pilot had spotted that casing to access the landing gear was slightly open and reported this, with the plane returning to the airport for maintenance.",
      "The plane had also been a Boeing 737-800, the same model as the aircraft that crashed on Sunday.",
      "In his news conference, Mr Kim said Jeju Air had paid the most fines and faced the most administrative action of any Korean airline over the last five years. But he insisted the airline has consistently improved its safety record.",
      "He said the company had a strict maintenance checklist, adding: \"If something was missed it would be a grave problem.\"",
      "Jeju Air has apologised to the victims' families and vowed to provide emergency compensation and cover funeral costs.",
      "The company's chief executive said the airline had no history of accidents and it is believed Sunday's crash has been its only fatal accident since it was launched in 2005.",
      "What are officials doing now?",
      "South Korea's Acting President Choi Sang-mok has ordered an emergency safety inspection of the country's entire airline operations, which is set to be completed by 3 January.",
      "Muan has also been declared a special disaster zone, which makes central government funding available to the local government and victims.",
      "All flights to and from Muan International Airport have been cancelled, with the airport staying closed until 7 January.",
      "A \"black box\" flight data recorder recovered from the crash site was missing a key connector and authorities were reviewing how to extract its data. However retrieval of data from the cockpit voice recorder has begun, South Korea's transport ministry said.",
      "A national seven-day period of mourning has been declared, and New Year's Day celebrations in the country are likely to be cancelled or scaled down.",
      "Aircraft maker Boeing has said it is in touch with Jeju Air and stands \"ready to support them\".",
      "What is a bird strike?",
      "A bird strike is a collision between a plane in flight and a bird. They are very common - in the UK, there were more than 1,400 bird strikes reported in 2022, only about 100 of which affected the plane, according to data from the Civil Aviation Authority.",
      "The best known bird strike occurred in 2009, when an Airbus plane made an emergency landing on New York's Hudson River after colliding with a flock of geese. All 155 passengers and crew survived.",
      "Professor Doug Drury, who teaches aviation at CQUniversity Australia, wrote in an article for The Conversation this summer that Boeing planes - like Airbus and Embraer - had turbofan engines, which could be severely damaged in a bird strike.",
      "He said that pilots were trained to be especially vigilant during the early morning or at sunset, when birds were most active.",
      "But some aviation experts are sceptical about whether a bird strike could have caused the crash at Muan Airport.",
      "\"Typically they [bird strikes] don't cause the loss of an airplane by themselves,\" Mr Thomas told Reuters.",
      "Australian airline safety expert Geoffrey Dell also told the news agency: \"I've never seen a bird strike prevent the landing gear from being extended.\"",

    "story": [
      "An Argentine judge confirmed charges against five people in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction, and ordered preventive prison for two of them for having supplied him with drugs.",
      "A judicial officer confirmed Monday the judge's decision and said that one of the two people ordered to be put under preventive prison \u2014 a form of pre-trial detention \u2014 was an employee of the hotel in Buenos Aires where Payne stayed until he died after falling from the balcony of his room in October.",
      "The officer said the other person was a waiter Payne met in a restaurant. The officer, who requested not to be identified as a condition to talk about the ruling, said that both face charges for supplying drugs and they need to present themselves before the judge.",
      "The judge also charged three other people with manslaughter, including a businessman who was with Payne in Argentina and two managers of the hotel. The official said that they were not ordered to be held under preventive prison.",
      "The hotel manager and hotel reception manager who were charged saw Payne intoxicated and unable to stand in the hotel lobby prior to his death, according to a\u00a0news release from the prosecutor's office. Authorities said the manager permitted Payne to be taken up to his room, which had a balcony, and the reception manager helped bring him up to his room, instead of keeping him in a place without sources of danger and with company until medical help could arrive.",
      "In November, prosecutors filed initial charges against three people, but they didn't reveal their names.",
      "Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding.",
      "Prosecutors also said that Payne's toxicological exams showed that his body had \"traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant\" in the moments before his death.",
      "Payne's autopsy showed his injuries were caused neither by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious.",
      "Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the possibility that Payne died by suicide.",
      "One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne \u2014 like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson \u2014 pursued a solo career.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, ending one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history but not every legal issue between them.",
      "Jolie and Pitt signed off on a default declaration filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday, saying they've entered into a written agreement on their marital and property rights. The filing says they give up the right to any future spousal financial support but gives no other details. A judge will need to sign off on the agreement.",
      "The settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "Jolie's lawyer, James Simon, told CBS News in a statement that, \"More than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\"",
      "A representative for Pitt declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood's most prominent pairings for 12 years, two of them as a married couple. The Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A representative for Pitt, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly, strongly denied Jolie's allegations.",
      "During the long divorce fight, four of the couple's six children became adults, negating the need for a custody agreement for them. The only two who are still minors are 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. In June, one of their daughters, then known as Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, successfully petitioned to remove Pitt's name from hers.",
      "Their other children are 23-year-old Maddox, 21-year-old Pax and 19-year-old Zahara.",
      "There have been no official court actions in the case in nearly a year, and no indication that the two had been nearing an agreement.",
      "Some details on their disputes, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. Jolie instead sold her part of the winery, Chateau Miraval, to the Tenute del Mondo wine group, a subsidiary of the Stoli Group, which Pitt said was a \"vindictive\" move that ruined a private space that had been a second home.",
      "Jolie's attorneys said the winery sale agreement broke down over Pitt's demand that as part of the deal she sign a wide-ranging non-disclosure agreement about him. In court documents, she called that an attempt to cover up his physical abuse of her, which she said turned toward the children on the 2016 flight.",
      "It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect the winery lawsuit.",
      "Publicly, both Pitt and Jolie have been extremely tight-lipped on everything surrounding their split, despite robust promotional tours and many media appearances for various projects.",
      "Pitt said in a 2017 interview with GQ that he had had a drinking problem at the time of the plane incident and the split, but had since become sober and was going to therapy. He has not defended his behavior on the family flight.",
      "Jolie has also declined to make any public statements about the family issues or the divorce, though she has sought a broader examination and airing of his behavior by the courts in both the divorce and winery cases.",
      "Both Jolie and Pitt were among the most elite stars in film when they began dating in 2004, after co-starring as hitman-and-hitwoman spouses in \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" and remained atop the Hollywood A-list throughout their coupling. The daughter of Hollywood luminary Jon Voight and the star of \"Maleficent\" and \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,\" Jolie won an Oscar for her performance in 1999's \"Girl, Interrupted.\"",
      "Pitt, the star of \"Fight Club\" and \"Inglourious Basterds,\" thrived as both actor and producer after the split. He won his own Academy Award for 2019's \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\" the crowning achievement in an awards season that some in media framed as a redemption and brought major public affection for him.",
      "Jolie has kept a less visible profile in the years since the divorce, though she directed several films and appeared in several more while trying to focus on raising the children.",
      "She has very much returned to the Oscar conversation this year for her portrayal of the legendary soprano Maria Callas in \"Maria.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 09:38:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The comedian, who will host the Golden Globes on January 5, says she thrives on anxiety.",
    "story": [
      "\"When you're a white, pasty girl, you get a spray tan, everyone's nicer to you!\" said Nikki Glaser during her standup act. \"They think, like, you've been on vacation, they think things are going well in your life. And they're not; you've just stood naked in front of a teenager. \u2026 And in the middle of her spraying me, like, seeing my butt, she goes, 'I'm such a fan!'\"",
      "Glaser thought she had her January all planned out: \"So, for January 2025, I was going to possibly have, like, a brow lift or some kind of, like, really invasive surgery that I've been, you know, looking into getting.\"",
      "The kind of procedure where you have to disappear from the public for a while, and then re-emerge. But then, she got a phone call from TWO of her agents: \"And when it's two, you know it's good news, because when it's bad news, they just make one person do it, 'cause no one wants to do that! And they're like, 'So, this operation, is there any way you could push it 'til maybe the second week of January?'\"",
      "That's because on January 5, Glaser is hosting the Golden Globes on CBS \u2013 just another big gig in a year that's been filled with them.",
      "Her 2024 special, \"Someday You'll Die,\" was nominated for an Emmy, a Grammy and a Golden Globe.",
      "\"It's easy to be a bad mom; that's so easy. But to be a good mom is hard. To be a bad mom, that's as easy as being a great dad.\"",
      "But it's the special's theme song that Glaser wrote that she's most proud of: \"Honestly, it might be, like, one of the things I'm most proud of in my entire life.\"",
      "\"It couldn't be more different than joke writing, right, in terms of the vulnerability?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, yes, because everything with joking is, like, I get vulnerable, then I cut it with, like, some kind of line that's like, 'I'm just kidding.' I was talking about my depression, but we're all not gonna get emotional here. There's just something so embarrassing about being emotional for me. So, I think I just have to reframe it as like, 'You can't do it, Nikki. It's too hard,' and I'll be like, 'Yes, I can.'\"",
      "Glaser made her name in celebrity roasts with a searing joke style, deadpanning at her own expense and the expense of others, jokes we mostly can't play for you on network TV \u2013 all of which came in handy earlier this year when she roasted NFL great Tom Brady live on Netflix.",
      "\"Tom also lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? I mean, even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money.'\"",
      "Glaser says, though she's mostly done with roasts, she actually asked Netflix for the job: \"I was like, 'Tell Tom Brady I'm the Tom Brady of roasting.' It's flattery, but it's also true. I meant it. I really feel like Tom Brady is a guy that worked hard enough to become how great he is.\"",
      "The same could be said about Glaser \u2026 and the Golden Globes will be her biggest audience to date. \"I'm gonna nail it,\" she said. \"Maybe I won't nail it in some people's eyes, but I will have nailed it in my eyes because I have set up a system leading up to it that I couldn't possibly work harder on it.\"",
      "More on that system later \u2026 because confidence is not something that's always come easy to Glaser.",
      "She's talked about struggles with self-medicating, eating disorders, and alcoholism. \"I drank every single night of my life and it was, like, the only thing I looked forward to in my life,\" she said. \"For me, drinking was the worst of all of them. And it's been kind of whack-a-mole with all of those. But those have never caused me as much pain as drinking did. So, I'm glad that drinking is just not an option.\"",
      "I said, \"In recovery they talk about this thing called, like, the 'dis-ease' \u2013 just this kind of general state of not being at ease.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Glaser said. \"The obsession with work is, like, just not wanting to feel.\"",
      "Will the pressure of hosting the Globes get to Glaser? She says she hopes it does. \"I thrive on anxiety,\" she said. \"I like feeling like, 'Oh, what's gonna happen?' I like that feeling. I kill it when I'm anxious.\"",
      "Glaser's \"system,\" which she first developed for the Brady roast, is working with a team of writers that includes Sean O'Conner, Jessica Dweck, and Glaser's longtime boyfriend and collaborator, Chris Convy.",
      "Those jokes they come up are then tested over and over, both on the road and in small L.A. clubs, to see what real audiences think.",
      "\"I did have a bunch of Ozempic jokes that I was gonna tell, but I lost them. The natural way, I swear! I just cut out soda.\"",
      "The Golden Globes audience will decide on January 5th if all this preparation by Glaser has paid off. But she says, in a certain way, she's already working on her next project, an off-stage one at that.",
      "\"I think my new challenge is, I wanna be known for being a nice celebrity,\" Glaser said. \"I just wanna be someone that people go, 'Oh, she's really great to work with. She was really nice to us,' and not in an inauthentic way.\"",
      "\"You wanna spread kindness to people while you're eviscerating their entire existence in your periphery?\" I asked.",
      "\"That's the paradox of it,\" she said. \"I wanna spread honesty.\"",
      "Don't miss the 82nd annual Golden Globes ceremony live on January 5 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on CBS and Paramount+.",

      "They alleged that they were initially told they would wear flesh-colored undergarments in a bedroom scene, but on the day of the shoot, Zeffirelli told the pair they would wear only body makeup and that the camera would be positioned in a way that would not show nudity. They alleged they were filmed in the nude without their knowledge.",
      "The case was dismissed by a Los Angeles County judge in 2023, who found their depiction could not be considered child pornography and the pair filed their claim too late.",
      "Whiting was among those paying tribute to Hussey on Saturday. \"Rest now my beautiful Juliet no injustices can hurt you now. And the world will remember your beauty inside and out forever,\" he wrote.",

    "story": [
      "An Alabama woman who says she was raped by Jay-Z and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs when she was 13 can proceed anonymously, for now, in her lawsuit against the rap moguls, a New York federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "In her written order, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres said the woman can proceed anonymously at this early stage of the litigation, but she may be required to reveal her identity at a later date, if the case proceeds. That would allow defense lawyers to collect facts necessary to prepare for trial. Torres also cited \"substantial interest\" from the public.",
      "The Manhattan jurist also chastised Alex Spiro \u2014 the lawyer representing Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter \u2014 for what she described as his \"relentless filing of combative motions containing inflammatory language and ad hominem attacks\" against the plaintiff's lawyer, calling them \"inappropriate, a waste of judicial resources, and a tactic unlikely to benefit his client.\"",
      "Torres wrote in her order Thursday that Spiro, who has been on the case less than three weeks, has submitted a \"litany of letters and motions attempting to impugn the character of Plaintiff's lawyer, many of them expounding on the purported 'urgency' of this case.\"",
      "In response to the ruling, Tony Buzbee, the plaintiff's attorney, told CBS News in an email Thursday evening that he doesn't \"typically comment on court rulings,\" but alleged that \"the coordinated and desperate efforts to attack me as counsel for alleged victims are falling flat.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Carter's attorneys for comment.",
      "Combs remains jailed in New York awaiting a criminal trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He also faces a wave of sexual assault lawsuits, many of which were filed by Buzbee, a Texas attorney who says his firm represents over 150 people, both men and women, who allege sexual abuse and exploitation by Combs.",
      "The lawsuits allege many individuals were abused at parties in New York, California and Florida after receiving drug-laced drinks.",
      "Combs' lawyers have dismissed Buzbee's lawsuits as \"shameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs.\" Jay-Z has said in a statement that Buzbee is trying to blackmail him to settle the Alabama woman's allegations.",
      "In her lawsuit, the woman who says she was raped at 13 identifies herself as \"Jane Doe.\" She said she was living in Rochester in 2000 when she made her way to New York City and befriended a limousine driver who drove her to an after-party for the MTV Music Awards, where she says she was eventually attacked by Jay-Z and Combs.",
      "Spiro asked the judge to dismiss the entertainer from the woman's lawsuit and he requested a hearing on the case for the day after he made his requests in writing on Dec. 18.",
      "Citing an interview the plaintiff did with NBC News, Spiro wrote that the broadcast revealed \"glaring inconsistencies and outright impossibilities\" in the plaintiff's story. For one thing, the woman said she traveled for five hours from Rochester to watch the music awards show on a jumbotron outside the VMAs even though permits and pictures show there was no jumbotron at the event.",
      "Spiro also noted that the woman's father has said he does not recall driving from Rochester to pick his daughter up in New York City, as she says he did.",

    "story": [
      "Gardners Candies is recalling Cappuccino Meltaway Bars sold nationwide because they may contain undeclared cashews, which can pose serious or life-threatening reactions in people with tree nut allergies.",
      "The Tyrone, Pennsylvania-based candy maker initiated its recall after discovering the \"tree nut-containing product was distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of tree nuts,\" it said in a notice posted Friday by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "\"People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to tree nuts run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products,\" Gardners stated. Nearly 4 million Americans are allergic to tree nuts, according to Food Allergy Research & Education, a health advocacy group.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 23:11:16 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I feel like we should've learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" Dr. Leana Wen said.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Leana Wen said Sunday that the lack of testing for bird flu doesn't mean that the virus isn't alive in humans, and that she feels the federal government \"should have learned our lesson from COVID\" and should be proactive in making tests available for Americans \u2014 and not wait for labs to characterize the cases and their severity.",
      "\"I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not,\" she added.",
      "The recent outbreak of bird flu stems from a mutation of the H5N1 virus that affects humans more easily, compared to past mutations of the virus that targeted birds and not mammals.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC reported its first severe case of bird flu in the U.S. found in a patient in Louisiana who was infected from a backyard poultry flock. The Louisiana case was first confirmed by health officials Friday, adding to the total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. Another severe case of H5N1 has been reported in a teen in British Columbia.",
      "According to the CDC, the mutations found in humans seemed to develop as the virus adapted to its host. The genetic changes in the H5N1 samples from the infected human were not present in the samples from the backyard poultry flock that infected the patient, suggesting that the concerning mutations had not developed until after the transmission of the virus. Federal health officials in the report said that spread between close contacts is more likely when these changes develop during the clinical course of a human infection.",
      "\"It's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors,\" Wen said\u00a0 Sunday, adding that this mutation allows a person to have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "Wen added that she believes the number of H5N1 cases currently reported in the U.S. is likely an undercount due to the lack of testing.",
      "\"We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states; 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing,\" Wen said.",
      "Wen on Sunday also urged the Biden administration to approve the H5N1 vaccine, which is already developed and contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses but awaits FDA authorization \u2013 a key difference from the beginning stages of COVID.",
      "\"There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out to farm workers and to vulnerable people,\" Wen said. \"I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility.\"",
      "The push for immediate authorization of vaccines and additional testing is rooted in concern that the Trump administration could potentially delay vaccines.",
      "\"I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence,\" Wen said. \"Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe, as we could be having for bird flu, the way that we had for COVID.\"",
      "Some of President-elect Trump's cabinet picks like Dr. Marty Makary, who is set to lead the FDA, Wen described as \"very competent\" and an \"independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges.\" There is more concern, however, over Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the controversial pick for Health and Human secretary who has spread false information on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern, in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services,\" Wen said.\u00a0 \"Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti-vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti vaccine advocates in the country, if not in the world, over the last couple of decades.\"",

      "The FDA's proposed rule would require manufacturers test samples of talc-containing cosmetic products for asbestos with methods including polarized light and transmission electron microscopy, which lights up samples with an electron beam. Alternatively, companies could also rely on a certificate of analysis from their talc suppliers, the agency stated.",

    "summary": "Luma, a private company that distributes electricity in Puerto Rico, has blamed previous \"financial mismanagement\" for problems with the island's grid.",
    "story": [
      "A massive power outage\u00a0blanketed most of Puerto Rico\u00a0early Tuesday, leaving more than 1.2 million people without electricity. Here's what to know about the blackout and Luma Energy, which handles distribution and transmission of electricity on the island.",
      "What caused the blackout?",
      "Luma Energy said in a statement that it is investigating the cause of the outage, but noted that preliminary findings point to problems with an underground line.",
      "How soon will power be restored in Puerto Rico?",
      "Luma said in a statement early Tuesday that it would likely take 24-28 hours to restore electricity across Puerto Rico.",
      "Later the company said service had resumed in some areas, including the Municipal Hospital of San Juan, but it didn't disclose how many people still lacked power.",
      "Puerto Rico's main airport, the Aeropuerto Internacional Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, said Tuesday on social media that it had activated backup power generators and was operating normally.",
      "What is Luma?",
      "Luma is a private Canadian-American company, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that operates and manages the electric power infrastructure in Puerto Rico.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which\u00a0devastated the U.S. territory\u00a0in September of 2017, the Puerto Rico government in 2021 hired Luma to handle the transmission and distribution of electricity on the island. Power was previously overseen by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which went\u00a0bankrupt in 2017\u00a0as the government faced billions of dollars in public debt payments.",
      "Luma CEO Juan Saca, a veteran telecom industry executive who was appointed to lead the company in 2023, said in a Sept. 26 hearing before a House panel that Luma has made significant investments to improve Puerto Rico's grid. That includes installing more than 17,850 hurricane-proof utility poles, adding thousands of automation devices aimed at softening the impact of power outages, and clearing vegetation around the island that can impede maintenance.",
      "\"The impact of this has been real. Over the last year, more than 95% of customers had concurrent service more than 98% of the time when generation was available,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "But Saca also sought to deflect criticism that Puerto Rico's electricity system remains unreliable, pointing to previous \"financial mismanagement.\" PREPA's bankruptcy seven years ago has also hindered progress in strengthening and modernizing the island's grid, he said.",
      "Have Puerto Ricans faced previous power outages?",
      "Puerto Rico's electric grid was troubled even before Maria, a consequence of inadequate maintenance and years of underinvestment. But the Category 4 storm crippled the system: Seven years after Maria chronic power outages and high electricity costs are common in Puerto Rico.",
      "In June, to cite one recent example, a power outage plunged more than 340,000 Puerto Ricans into darkness after two power plants on the island shut down.",
      "\"They're part of my everyday life,\" Enid N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events, told the Associated Press. Ra\u00fal Pacheco, a 63-year-old diabetic struggling with an injured foot, said he planned to sleep on his balcony during the outage.",
      "Antonio Torres Miranda, associate commissioner of Puerto Rico's energy agency, said in the House hearing this fall that the island's power distribution and transmission systems have made progress but remain subpar.",
      "\"The recent outage events of June 2024, which affected over 300,000 customers, serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of our infrastructure and the urgent need for comprehensive improvements,\" he said. \"These incidents highlight the complex interplay of aging assets, deferred maintenance and the increasing impacts of climate change on our island's power grid.\"",
      "Some critics are blunter in their assessment of Luma's record in Puerto Rico.",
      "\"Almost 25 years into the 21st century, it is ridiculous that Puerto Rico's power grid has failed its people again. Puerto Ricans deserve answers and accountability from Luma for this latest fiasco,\" Camille Rivera, founder of La Brega Y Fuerza, a grassroots advocacy group, said in a statement. \"Luma has Puerto Rico in an energy stranglehold, and Puerto Ricans shouldn't have to put up with continued subpar service.\"",

      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 11:39:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are calling for the U.S. to admit more foreign tech workers. Not all Republicans agree with them.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy may be advising President-elect Donald Trump on cutting federal spending\u00a0but they also have some advice for him about the U.S. workforce, urging his next administration to bring in more foreign tech workers.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy's views have sparked an online spat between factions of Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry, whose businesses rely on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of foreign engineers and other skilled workers each year from India, China and other nations.",
      "The tech industry has long called for more H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S., although Trump's first administration restricted the program in 2020, arguing that it allows businesses to replace Americans with lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "That debate has again erupted after Musk, himself once on an H-1B visa and whose electric vehicle company Tesla has hired workers using the program, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. Ramaswamy, for his part, wrote in an X post that American culture \"has venerated mediocrity over excellence,\" leading to a nation that does \"not produce the best engineers.\"",
      "\"There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley,\" Musk wrote on Dec. 25 on X, his social media app.",
      "Here's what to know about the debate and the H-1B visa.",
      "How did the most recent H-1B debate begin?",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer\u00a0with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \"not America First policy\" and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Who qualifies for an H-1B visa?",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says\u00a0the H-1B visa is geared toward professionals with a \"theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,\" and who have a bachelor's degree or higher in their field.",
      "Those professionals also need to have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company, which must offer a wage that's not lower than that paid to similarly qualified workers or below the prevailing wage for the job in the geographic area where that person will be working.",
      "How many workers receive H-1B visas?",
      "The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be granted for those with a master's degree or higher, USCIS says. The visa is valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years beyond that.",
      "However, the U.S. approves extensions each year for people already working on H-1B visas, with a 2023 report noting that the agency granted the greenlight to more than 309,000 requests for continuing employment under the visa program.",
      "What countries do H-1B recipients come from?",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders stem from a wide range of nations, including Canada, Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a USCIS report.",
      "What's the debate about H-1B visas?",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions.",
      "But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Some investigations, including a 2017\u00a0report from CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" have found that while many businesses use the program as intended, some have taken advantage of the visa program to replace American workers with less expensive temporary foreign workers.",
      "What does Donald Trump say about H-1B visas?",
      "Trump has not officially outlined his policy preferences on the H-1B program, but he\u00a0told The New York Post in a Dec. 28 interview that he has \"always been in favor of the visas.\"",
      "\"I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I've been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times; it's a great program,\" he added. His presidential transition team did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "Still, Trump's positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge to conduct mass deportations, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \"very bad\" and \"unfair\" for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration required employers to pay H-1B holders higher wages, a move they argued would discourage U.S. companies from turning to cheaper labor from abroad.",

      "You may think you have a pretty good idea of the world map, but Atossa Araxia Abrahamian explains how special economic zones, tax havens, and free ports are carving up the planet for the highest bidders \u2013 and leaving millions of people worse off.",
      "\"The Hidden Globe: How Wealth Hacks the World\" (Riverhead Books) makes a complex financial and legal subject clear, exciting \u2026 and deeply troubling.",
      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"The Hidden Globe\" by Atossa Araxia Abrahamian",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We tend to think of ourselves as citizens, or at least residents, of a nation.",
      "After all, the lessons most of us encountered in school included a map of the world divided by lines into countries. Each country, we learned, has a government; and each government rules over its land and its things and its people. The idea of one land, one law, one people, and one government is dominant, powerful, and often accurate. It forms the basis for much of national and international law.",
      "The hidden globe is a kind of transfiguration of this map, an accretion of cracks and concessions, suspensions and abstractions, carve-outs and free zones, and other places without nationality in the conventional sense, stretching from the ocean floor to outer space. The hidden globe is a mercenary world order in which the power to make and shape law is bought, sold, hacked, reshaped, deterritorialized, reterritorialized, transplanted, and reimagined. It is state power catapulted beyond a state's borders. It is also a state's selective abdication of certain powers within its remit: enclaves filled not by lawlessness but by different, weirder laws.",
      "The concept of the loophole originated in the seventeenth century to describe the small vertical slits in a castle wall through which archers could fire without risking enemy exposure. Its modern meaning has not changed all that much, only the archers are lawyers, consultants, and accountants\u2014and the fortress, the state itself.",
      "The desire to carve out exceptions is not new: communities have always set places apart for the purpose of contemplation, ritual, and worship. The Celts called these \"thin places,\" where the distance between heaven and earth was said to be shorter.",
      "Today, our elsewheres and nowheres aren't places of offerings, but places of evasion. They remind us of the newness of our world of bordered, independent states\u2014a mold whose contents began to set only after decolonization\u2014and its vulnerability to more powerful forces.",
      "Capitalists, forever pursuing profit, regard liminal and offshore jurisdictions as frontiers. This book is as much about these modern frontiersmen as it is about their battlegrounds. But theirs is no freewheeling regime of open borders. While the existence of the hidden globe might appear to challenge the myth of the meaningful, unified nation, the nation is too sticky and politically expedient a concept to do away with entirely. In fact, the hidden globe can empower the most xenophobic and exclusionary nationalism. And these policies are not just the domain of the political right. Whether Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, the regimes behind them aim to bring the right people in and keep the wrong ones out.",
      "By enabling nationalist immigration policies, the hidden globe thus circumscribes the lives of the world's most disenfranchised people: there are detainees languishing in offshore prisons in the Caribbean and the Pacific, impoverished workers processing goods for export in duty-free industrial zones across the Global South, sailors and asylum seekers stuck on vessels they cannot leave for lack of papers. When a person can't stay home and is unwanted abroad, they might end up in a third space: neither here nor there. Seeing these spaces for what they are changed the way I saw the world, and I think it will change the way you see it too.",

    "summary": "Federal officials say homelessness rose 18% in 2024, driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing.",
    "story": [
      "Homelessness in the U.S. jumped 18.1% this year, hitting a record level, with the dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in some regions of the country, federal officials said Friday.",
      "More than 770,000 people were counted as homeless in federally required tallies taken across the country during a single night in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in its new report.\u00a0The estimate likely undercounts the number of unhoused people given that it doesn't include people staying with friends or family because they don't have a place of their own.",
      "That jump comes on top of a 12% increase in 2023, which HUD blamed on soaring rents and the end of pandemic assistance. The 2023 increase also was driven by people experiencing homelessness for the first time.",
      "Vulnerable Americans have been hard hit during the post-pandemic years as many government supports ended, including the eviction moratorium. At the same time, housing costs are surging, causing a record number of renters to be cost-burdened, or paying more than 30% of their income on housing,\u00a0according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.",
      "\"More people than ever need help paying rent. More people than ever are becoming homeless for the first time,\" the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonprofit focused on preventing and ending homelessness, wrote on X in a post about the HUD report.",
      "The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population.",
      "\"No American should face homelessness,\" HUD Agency head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on \"evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.\"",
      "However, because the report is based on data collected almost a year earlier, it may not accurately represent current circumstances, the statement added. For instance, unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have declined this year, after migrant apprehensions soared to record highs under President Joe Biden, peaking at 250,000 in December 2024.",
      "A rise in family homelessness",
      "Among the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness \u2014 one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of migrants in big cities. Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities.",
      "Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year.",
      "Disasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count.",
      "\"Increased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,\" Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. \"As advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.\"",
      "Bans on camping",
      "The numbers also come as increasing numbers of communities are taking a hard line against homelessness.",
      "Angered by often dangerous and dirty tent camps, communities \u2014 especially in Western states \u2014 have been enforcing bans on camping. That follows a 6-3 ruling last year by the Supreme Court that found that outdoor sleeping bans don't violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness.",
      "There was some positive news in the count, as homelessness among veterans continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024.",
      "\"The reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,\" Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. \"With bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide. Federal investments are critical in tackling the country's housing affordability crisis and ensuring that every American has access to safe, stable housing.\"",
      "Cities where homelessness is declining",
      "Several large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023.",
      "California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts.",
      "The sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade.",
      "Going back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017.",

      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter sent to congressional leaders Friday afternoon that her agency will need to start taking \"extraordinary measures\" or special accounting maneuvers intended to prevent the nation from hitting the debt ceiling as early as Jan. 14.",
      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling\u00a0\u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \"extraordinary measures\" or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out the government risks defaulting on its debt unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government's ability to borrow.",
      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump's core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation's debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \"Anything else is a betrayal of our country,\" Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "Notably however, Yellen said, on Jan. 2 the debt is projected to temporarily decrease due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments. As a result, \"Treasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.",
      "The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion \u2014 which ballooned across both Republican and Democratic administrations. And the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic pushed up government borrowing costs such that debt service next year will exceed spending on national security.",

      "Although he was with Time Warner through its difficulties with AOL, he earned respect for the company and rebuilt its relations with Wall Street. He streamlined Time Warner's structure, pared debt and sold Warner Music Group and a book publishing division.",
      "He also fended off a challenge from activist investor Carl Icahn in 2006 to break up the company and helped Time Warner reach settlements with investors and regulators over questionable accounting practices at AOL.",
      "Parsons joined Time Warner as president in 1995 after serving as chairman and chief executive of Dime Bancorp Inc., one of the largest U.S. thrift institutions.",
      "In 2001, after AOL used its fortunes as the leading provider of Internet access in the U.S. to buy Time Warner for $106 billion in stock, Parsons became co-chief operating officer with AOL executive Robert Pittman. In that role, he was in charge of the company's content businesses, including movie studios and recorded music.",
      "He became CEO in 2002 with the retirement of Gerald Levin, one of the key architects of that merger. Parsons was named Time Warner chairman the following year, replacing AOL founder Steve Case, who had also championed the combination.",
      "The newly formed company's internet division quickly became a drag on Time Warner. The promised synergies between traditional and new media never materialized. AOL began seeing a reduction in subscribers in 2002 as Americans replaced dial-up connections with broadband from cable TV and phone companies.",
      "Parsons stepped down as CEO in 2007 and as chairman in 2008. A year later AOL split from Time Warner and began trading as a separate company, following years of struggles to reinvent itself as a business focused on advertising and content. Time Warner is now owned by AT&T Inc.",
      "A board member of Citigroup and its predecessor, Citibank, since 1996, Parsons was named chairman in 2009 at a time of turmoil for the financial institution. Citigroup had suffered five straight quarters of losses and received $45 billion in government aid. Its board had been criticized for allowing the bank to invest so heavily in the risky housing market.",
      "Citigroup returned to profit under Parsons, starting in 2010, and would not have a quarterly loss again until the fourth quarter of 2017. Parsons retired from that job in 2012.",
      "In 2014 he stepped in as interim CEO of the Clippers until Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer took over later that year.",
      "Parsons, a Republican, previously worked as a lawyer for Nelson Rockefeller, a former Republican governor of New York, and in Gerald Ford's White House. Those early stints gave him grounding in politics and negotiations. He also was an economic adviser on President Barack Obama's transition team.",
      "Parsons, who loved jazz and co-owned a Harlem jazz club, also served as chairman of the Apollo Theater and the Jazz Foundation of America. And he held positions on the boards of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, the American Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.",
      "Parsons played basketball at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and received his law degree from Albany Law School in 1971. He is survived by his wife, Laura, and their family.",

      "This holiday shopping season saw Americans stepping up their purchases at retail stores, with many chains luring shoppers with big Black Friday discounts. But with the holiday now over, retailers are beginning to roll out their post-Christmas sales, aiming to entice shoppers to spend more.",
      "Shoppers spent between $979.5 billion and $989 billion last month and in December, with retail sales up 2.5% to 3.5%\u00a0from a year ago, according to an estimate from the National Retail Federation, the nation's biggest retail trade group.",
      "Retailers are now looking to encourage more of the same in wrapping up the holidays with additional post-Christmas promotions. This year's shorter holiday shopping period placed pressure on some retailers, some of which also struggled to attract inflation-weary consumers through their doors.",
      "\"So far, post-Christmas discounts seem to be slightly bigger than last year,\" GlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Retailers are working hard to stimulate demand and nudging consumers into spending.\"",
      "He added, \"That said, there is not a dramatic difference. A lot of retailers managed inventory well this year so they don't have loads of stuff left over that they need to shift.\"",

      "Do products usually go on sale after Christmas?",
      "Yes, retailers typically offer post-holiday sales to reduce inventory after Christmas.

    "summary": "The Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, requires some businesses to register with FINCEN next month, or face fines. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "An anti-money laundering law called the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, is now back in action after a Dec. 23 court ruling that will require millions of small business owners to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by mid-January, or potentially pay fines of up to $10,000.",
      "The registration rule had been on hold since Dec. 3, when a federal court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting its enforcement. But on Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the order, ruling that the decision is in the \"public's urgent interest in combating financial crime and protecting our country's national security.\"",
      "The CTA requires that the owners and part-owners of an estimated 32.6 million small businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address, by Jan. 1. With the court ruling that enforcement can proceed, many small business owners may scramble to register ahead of deadline, although FinCEN said on Dec. 23 that it is extending the deadline until Jan. 13 due to the late December court ruling.",
      "\"Reporting companies that were created or registered prior to Jan. 1, 2024 have until Jan. 13, 2025 to file their initial beneficial ownership information reports with FinCEN,\" the agency said in a statement. \"These companies would otherwise have been required to report by Jan. 1, 2025.\"",
      "Some business associations say the extension still doesn't give business owners enough time to meet the deadline.",
      "\"We are greatly concerned that a mere two-week extension does not provide enough time for millions of American businesses to comply with the law,\" Mark Eisele, president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a Dec. 24 letter. \"At minimum, we request Treasury provide a one-year delay to allow for greater education and outreach to small businesses across rural America.\"",
      "And some civil liberties groups decried the ruling, saying that the regulation represents governmental overreach.",
      "\"The government cannot be allowed to maintain this unconstitutional statute, which stretches beyond Congress's proper authority to regulate Americans,\" said the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a civil rights group, said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, a FinCEN spokesperson said the appeals court ruling \"underscores the importance and urgency of the Corporate Transparency Act for national security.\"",
      "\"The Corporate Transparency Act levels the playing field for tens of millions of law-abiding small businesses across the United States and makes it harder for bad actors to exploit loopholes in order to gain an unfair advantage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Here's what to know about the ruling and the CTA.",
      "What is the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA?",
      "The CTA, an anti-money laundering statute passed in 2021, was intended to get a look inside shell companies and crack down on attempts by \"criminals, organized crime rings, and other illicit actors to hide their identities and launder their money through the financial system,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in 2022.",
      "The rules first became effective in 2024, but gave existing businesses until Jan.1, 2025, to register, while businesses that began this year have 90 days to register.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is pledging to slap new tariffs on imports after he's inaugurated next month \u2014 a vow that's prompting the toy industry to warn about the impact.",
      "Even if toys are designed in Europe or the U.S., they are frequently manufactured in China, a nation whose exports Trump last month threatened to target with a new 10% tariff as soon as he takes office. On the campaign trail, he floated the idea of a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods. Nearly 80% of U.S. toys are manufactured in China, according to The Toy Association, an industry group.",
      "If Trump carries through with his tariff plan, toy prices would rise \"probably instantly,\" Jennifer Bergman, the owner of New York City's West Side Kids told CBS News. She estimates that about 90% of the toys she sells are made in China.",
      "To be sure, the toy industry isn't alone in fretting about the impact of Trump's promised tariffs, as higher prices on a broad range of imports would likely be passed onto consumers. After more than four decades serving the neighborhood, Bergman fears that higher prices may threaten her shop's survival and impact her customers.",
      "\"It would be heartbreaking,\" she said. \"It would be a real loss for the community. It would be a real loss for me. I can't really imagine not being here.\"",
      "If Trump follows through on his tariff plans, American consumers stand to lose as much as $78 billion in spending power annually on products, including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released last month.",
      "The toy industry is also sounding the alarm, with the Toy Association calling the potential tariffs \"significantly harmful\" and urging its members to contact their Congressional delegates to express their concern.",
      "Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports, but rather than being paid by the exporting country or company, the levy is paid by the importer \u2014 and much of that is handed off to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"A tariff of 60% on China would be a major shock to international goods markets,\" experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in a Dec. 12 blog post.",
      "The toy industry would be one of the U.S. industries facing the worst impacts because China is the dominant supplier to the U.S., they added.",
      "\"While toys seem like products for which substitute sellers would be readily available, China maintains a dominant position in toy production for several reasons, including its not-easily-reproduced capacity to produce materials that meet US product safety standards,\" they noted.",
      "Still, some economists say Trump could use the threat of tariffs as a bargaining tool, without actually implementing the import duties. And tariffs could also encourage more U.S. manufacturing of toys and other products, although that would likely take time for new factories to ramp up.",

      "\"We are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food,\" Oregon Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said in a Tuesday release. \"This cat was strictly an indoor cat; it was not exposed to the virus in its environment, and results from the genome sequencing confirmed that the virus recovered from the raw pet food and infected cat were exact matches to each other.\"",
      "Can pets transmit bird flu to owners?",
      "Oregon officials are monitoring household members who had contact with the cat to see if they develop any flu symptoms, but no human cases of bird flu were identified as of Tuesday and the risk of transmission to humans remains low in the state.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that it's unlikely for a pet owner to get sick with bird flu through direct contact with an infected pet, but it is possible. The health agency noted that in 2016, the spread of bird flu from a cat to a person was reported in New York City. The infected individual, a veterinarian, had mild flu symptoms after prolonged exposure to sick cats without using personal protective equipment.",

    "story": [
      "Michael Jeffries, the former longtime CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch, may have dementia, and a competency hearing is needed to determine if he can face sex charges, his attorneys claim.",
      "Defense lawyers for Jeffries said in court papers unsealed Monday in federal court in Central Islip on Long Island that a neuropsychologist who examined Jeffries in October concluded he likely has dementia with behavioral disturbance, Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.",
      "Jeffries, 80, is free on $10 million bond after pleading not guilty in October to federal sex trafficking and interstate prostitution charges. The former CEO was arrested\u00a0that same month on charges of sex trafficking and engaging in interstate prostitution, with prosecutors claiming Jeffries leveraged his position as CEO to lure young men into sex by suggesting they could model for the fashion company,",
      "The lawyers wrote that the neuropsychologist concluded that cognitive impairments, including impaired memory, diminished attention, processing speed slowness, and ease of confusion means Jeffries would not be capable of assisting his attorneys.",
      "In a joint letter to the judge, defense lawyers and prosecutors suggested that experts who have evaluated Jeffries testify at a two-day competency hearing in June so that a ruling on competency can follow. A spokesperson for prosecutors said Tuesday that the office would have no further comment.",
      "Jeffries arrest came after a 2023 lawsuit filed by an actor that alleged the former CEO ran a sex trafficking operation that targeted aspiring male models. In the current case, prosecutors say Jeffries, his romantic partner and a third man lured men into drug-fueled sex parties in the Hamptons, on Long Island, by dangling the promise of modeling for the retailer's ads.",
      "Jeffries left Abercrombie in 2014 after more than two decades leading the clothing retailer once famous for its preppy, all-American aesthetic and marketing with shirtless male models.",
      "In an indictment unveiled in October, prosecutors alleged that 15 accusers were induced by \"force, fraud and coercion\" to engage in sex parties from 2008 to 2015 in New York City and the Hamptons, the wealthy summertime resort on Long Island where Jeffries has a home, as well as at hotels in England, France, Italy, Morocco and St. Barts.",

    "summary": "The Treasury Department says Chinese hackers accessed several department workstations and unclassified documents. China denies any involvement.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday.",
      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",
      "China denied any involvement, Agency France-Presse reported, citing China's foreign ministry as saying Beijing \"has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes.\"",
      "\"We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.",
      "Chinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu dismissed the allegations, calling them an effort to \"smear\" China's reputation.",
      "\"The U.S. needs to stop using cybersecurity to smear and slander China, and stop spreading all kinds of disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats,\" he said in a statement, noting that China \"itself is a target of international cyberattacks, and consistently opposes and combats all forms of cyberattacks.\"",
      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. A top White House official said Friday that the number of telecommunications companies confirmed to have been affected by the hack has now risen to nine.",
      "The Treasury Department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key \"used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support\" to workers. That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",
      "The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee.",
      "The department said it was working with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and that the hack had been attributed to Chinese culprits. It did not elaborate.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Some of the defendants accused of being part of the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, are now asking courts for permission to return to Washington, D.C, on Jan. 20 to attend the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Many of the approximately 1,600 people who have been charged with felony or misdemeanor crimes for their alleged roles in the Jan. 6 attack have been subjected to court orders restricting their travel to and within the capital. But some have said that they should be afforded permission to return for the inauguration, arguing they are not a threat to public safety.",
      "In a court filing on Monday, the Justice Department argued against allowing defendant Christopher Belliveau to attend the inauguration. \"The last organized event the defendant attended in Washington, D.C., spiraled into a full-scale riot. This was the scene of his charged crime \u2014 a violent felony which contributed to the disruption of the peaceful transition of power,\" federal prosecutors wrote.",
      "\"The most compelling reason to deny Belliveau's motion is that allowing his travel to Washington, D.C. places Capitol Police Officers in danger,\" prosecutors added. \"Belliveau argues that his lack of violent past warrants a modification of his conditions of release. But that makes his return to the Capitol even more concerning \u2014 Belliveau was only willing to engage in violence against Capitol Police Officers who were trying to keep a crowd of rioters under control.\"",
      "Belliveau is accused of deploying bear spray against police during the Capitol attack and has pleaded not guilty. He filed his own motion in support of his request to attend the inauguration. Belliveau's attorneys argued, \"It is also vital to remember that, while Mr. Belliveau stands accused, he is presumed innocent, thus the mere fact that he is charged does not suggest that he is inherently more dangerous that any other person.\"",
      "Defendant Cindy Young, who was found guilty on four criminal charges at trial in August, has also sought permission to travel to Washington for the festivities. In her filing\u00a0on Dec. 11, Young's lawyer said she has \"complied with her conditions of release\" for \"well over a year.\"",
      "\"She poses no threat of danger to the community and she is not a risk of flight. She was allowed to travel several times to Washington, D.C., including to the Capitol building while preparing for trial and there were no incidents,\" Young's attorney said.",
      "But prosecutors opposed Young's request. Writing in response a week later, the Justice Department said Young has \"continuously endorsed calls for retribution against those involved in January 6 prosecutions \u2014 specifically jurors, judges, and law enforcement \u2014 all whom help make up the D.C. community.\" They wrote that Young \"has also mocked officer victims,\" many of whom \"will, once again, be tasked in protecting the Capitol and Constitution on January 20, 2025.\" The judge has not ruled on Young's request.",
      "William Pope, a Jan. 6 defendant who is serving as his own defense lawyer, also requested permission to attend the inauguration. In a filing on Saturday, Pope said, \"I now move the Court for permission to travel to Washington, D.C. for the purpose of attending the Presidential Inauguration on January 20, 2025. Initially, I had declined an invitation to attend the inauguration (since I don't enjoy being in Washington), however, I have now been asked a second time, and I believe it would be inappropriate for me to turn this request down.\"",
      "Pope has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial in May. The court filing did not specify who invited Pope to be in attendance. The Justice Department has not yet responded to the request.",
      "Trump has pledged to pardons at least some of those charged or convicted with crimes related to Jan. 6.\u00a0 According to the latest Justice Department report, approximately 1,000 defendants have pleaded guilty. Roughly 600 have been charged with assaulting or resisting police. There are several fugitives being sought by federal agents, with more arrests still expected.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to begin his second term in the White House in just a few weeks, he has suggested that he will use recess appointments to circumvent the Senate confirmation process and quickly install his picks to key positions across the federal government.",
      "The demand has been met with pushback from some Republicans, but there is another way in which Trump could place those loyal to him in high-ranking positions without Senate approval, albeit temporarily: a 25-year-old federal law that sets the rules for presidents to tap acting officials to fill vacant positions that require Senate confirmation.",
      "Enacted in 1998, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, or the Vacancies Act, limits which government employees can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and approval by the Senate.",
      "The playbook wouldn't be new to Trump, who installed \"acting\" leaders atop various federal agencies and subagencies in his first term, including the Departments of Defense and Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Some of the president-elect's nominees are likely to face headwinds in the GOP-led Senate, like Pete Hegseth, his pick to lead the Pentagon and Tulsi Gabbard, who he plans to tap for director of national intelligence. The Vacancies Act could become a key tool for Trump to ensure agencies are staffed with those loyal to him and his agenda.",
      "\"Congress has made the policy choice to have about 1,300 positions still require Senate consent,\" said Thomas Berry, a legal scholar at the Cato Institute. \"But what we have now is that any given time, half or more than half of those are filled not by Senate-confirmed people, not because Congress made that policy choice, but because the Vacancies Act can be pushed to the limit and maybe even beyond its limits, and it's so easy to have acting officers or sub-delegates essentially act in exactly the same way they would if they were Senate confirmed for years at a time.\"",
      "How the Vacancies Act works",
      "Under the Vacancies Act, there are three categories of federal workers who can temporarily fill a position covered by the law:",
      "The \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant officeAnother administration official who has already won Senate confirmationAn agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy happened and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale",
      "The \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant office",
      "Another administration official who has already won Senate confirmation",
      "An agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy happened and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale",
      "The Vacancies Act also sets a time limit for how long an acting official can serve, allowing them to fill the position for 300 days when installed at the beginning of a new administration. Temporary leaders elevated after the start of a term can remain in their role for 210 days, but that cap can be extended if a nomination is pending in the Senate. If a nomination is rejected, returned or withdrawn, the president gets another 210 days.",
      "When Trump took office after he was inaugurated the first time in January 2017, he tapped noncontroversial, longtime civil servants to serve in acting roles while the confirmation process played out, Berry said. He could do the same again for the first days or weeks after he returns to the White House on Jan. 20.",
      "But Berry said the landscape will shift as Trump's second term progresses. Eventually, there will be Senate-confirmed officials in lower-level positions and those at the highest pay grade who have served in their agencies for more than 90 days. Those officials could be then tapped for acting positions.",
      "\"The vacancies people should be more concerned about, the vacancies where Trump has a lot more flexibility, are the ones that occur in the middle of the term, not right on day one,\" he said.",
      "Presidents of both parties have installed acting officials in high-ranking positions in their administrations. But with 30 acting secretaries, Trump used more temporary leaders than those who were confirmed during his first four years in the White House, according to research from Anne Joseph O'Connell, a law professor at Stanford University who has extensively studied the Vacancies Act.",
      "How much Trump relies on the 1998 law in the early months of his second term could depend on his legislative priorities. With a Republican-controlled Congress, the president-elect and GOP lawmakers have said they plan to focus on extending Trump's signature tax reform law, portions of which are set to expire next year, as well as border security. And if a member of the Supreme Court retires, filling that seat would also be a significant priority while Republicans have a Senate majority.",
      "\"I assume, given the threat to use the recess appointments clause, that the Senate party leadership is going to work closely with the White House to get the Cabinet or most confirmed quickly through the traditional process, so then the question is, what else will the Senate make a priority?\" O'Connell said. \"The Vacancies Act offers a second-best pathway for filling agency positions.\"",
      "Since winning the White House in November, Trump has rolled out a slew of personnel picks, ranging from those who will serve in his Cabinet if nominated and confirmed by the Senate to candidates for ambassadorships to senior White House staff who do not require Senate approval. One of those candidates, former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, whom the president-elect selected for attorney general, took himself out of consideration after he came under renewed scrutiny for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, which he denied.",
      "While much of the focus is on Trump's picks for the most senior roles in his new administration, the leaders of subagencies could be filled through the Vacancies Act or through a delegation of duties to subordinates.",
      "\"That strategy can be done at these very influential positions that are just below the secretary level, and that's why you more often see pushing the boundaries of the Vacancies Act at that level,\" Berry said.",

    "summary": "The court roundly rejected claims by Trump that the judge who presided over the trial erred in a series of decisions.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is not entitled to a new trial in the case in which a jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation of the writer E. Jean Carroll, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.",
      "The court roundly rejected claims by Trump and his lawyers that the judge who presided over the trial made a series of decisions that harmed Trump's standing with the jury.",
      "Trump asked for a new trial after a jury unanimously concluded in May 2023 that a preponderance of evidence supported Carroll's claim that Trump sexually abused her during a mid-1990s encounter in a New York City department store. Monday's 77-page decision rejected complaints made repeatedly by Trump before, during and after the nine-day trial.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, based in New York, found that District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan did not err in allowing the testimonies of two women who made claims on the stand of alleged encounters with Trump that bore similarities to Carroll's.",
      "\"With his shoulder and the whole weight of his body against her, Mr. Trump held her against the wall, kissed her, pulled down her tights, and stuck his fingers into her vagina \u2014 until Ms. Carroll managed to get a knee up and push him back off of her,\" the appeals court wrote, summarizing evidence and testimony of Carroll's claim.",
      "Carroll said she and Trump bumped into each other by chance while shopping at Bergdorf Goodman. What started as a pleasant walk through the store \u2014 her helping him choose a present for another woman, as they engaged in jocular banter \u2014 turned violent in a changing room, she alleged.",
      "Trump has vehemently denied Carroll's allegations, and vowed to appeal the case as far as the Supreme Court. He has also appealed a January 2024 trial ruling that found him liable for more defamation against Carroll. That appeal is still pending. The juries in the two cases combined awarded Carroll more than $88 million.",
      "Attorneys for Trump did not immediately reply to a request for comment. A spokesman for Trump, Steven Cheung, said he plans to appeal, and said Americans who voted for Trump demand \"a swift dismissal of all the Witch Hunts.\"",
      "Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, thanked the appeals court for \"its careful consideration of the parties' arguments,\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision,\" said Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to the judge.",
      "Among Trump's complaints about the trial was that the jurors were shown an outtake from \"Access Hollywood,\" in which Trump could be heard describing grabbing women's genitals. The clip was widely shared during the 2016 presidential race. The court found that Lewis Kaplan did not err in allowing that video to be shown.",
      "Carroll's federal civil lawsuit made claims of rape, sexual abuse and defamation as defined by New York's penal code. The jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, but rejected the rape claim, which under New York's statute requires proof of forceful penetration involving the attacker's genitals.",
      "The judge later wrote that New York's penal code is out of touch with federal standards and a \"modern\" understanding of what rape is. In post-trial rulings he wrote that Carroll's assertion that Trump raped her was \"substantially true.\"",
      "\"The definition of rape in the New York Penal Law is far narrower than the meaning of 'rape' in common modern parlance, its definition in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes, and elsewhere,\" Lewis Kaplan wrote in July 2023",
      "The jury \"implicitly found Mr. Trump did in fact digitally rape Ms. Carroll,\" Lewis Kaplan wrote.",

      "He struggled to cultivate relationships in Washington and feuded openly with Democratic leaders in Congress. As oil prices and inflation soared, his popularity sank.",
      "But there were accomplishments along the way. Carter created the departments of Energy and Education. He established formal diplomatic ties with China and returned control of the Panama Canal to the Panamanians.",
      "Perhaps his greatest achievement was a historic peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, known as the Camp David Accords.",
      "\"Let history record that deep and ancient antagonism can be settled without bloodshed and without a staggering waste of precious lives,\" Carter said at the signing of the peace treaty on March 26, 1979.",
      "On Nov. 4, 1979, Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 Americans hostage. A U.S. military attempt to free them ended in disaster, with eight American servicemen killed in a crash. The crisis dominated Carter's reelection campaign, while the economy continued to struggle and inflation topped 18%.",
      "In the final days of his administration, the president and his team negotiated freedom for the hostages. They were released on Ronald Reagan's Inauguration Day.",
      "In the years after leaving the White House, the Carters established The Carter Center in Atlanta, with a mission to work toward advancing peace and global health.",
      "\"We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can choose to work together for peace. We can make these changes \u2014 and we must,\" he said in 2002 as he formally accepted the Nobel Peace Prize for his decades of humanitarian work.",
      "He and Rosalynn built houses with Habitat for Humanity, dedicating their efforts to the group for more than 30 years, and he penned more than 20 books.",
      "He sparked controversy with his 2006 book \"Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid,\" in which he characterized Israel's treatment of Palestinians as oppression. He later issued an open apology to the Jewish community, saying that suggestions for improvement should not stigmatize Israel.",
      "In 2007, Carter spoke at the funeral of his former political rival turned close friend and confidante, former President Ford.",
      "\"One of my proudest moments was at the commemoration of the 200th birthday of the White House, when two noted historians both declared that the Ford-Carter friendship was the most intensely personal between any two presidents in history,\" Carter said.",
      "Carter announced in August 2015 that he had been diagnosed with cancer, a form of melanoma that had spread to his liver and his brain. Though he curtailed his activities with The Carter Center, he continued to fundraise for the organization, and also continued teaching Sunday school classes in Plains, a tradition he started in his teens.",
      "Carter was treated with a new immunotherapy drug and made a remarkable recovery, sharing the news six months later that an MRI showed no signs of cancer.",
      "In May 2019, he suffered another health setback, falling and breaking his hip. He went home from the hospital to recover and was soon back to teaching his Sunday school class. Carter suffered two more falls in October 2019 and was hospitalized for a fractured pelvis. A month later, he was admitted to a hospital in Atlanta for a surgical procedure to relieve pressure on his brain.",
      "The Carter Center said in May 2023 that Rosalynn had been diagnosed with dementia; she continued to live at home with her husband until her death that November.",
      "They are survived by their four children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",
      "During his many years after the White House, Carter planted seeds of peace, and sometimes seeds of controversy. But as one of the most active former presidents in history, many believe he defined the role for those who would follow.",

      "Others were likely there because of what President Carter accomplished in the longest, and most impactful, post-presidency in American history \u2013 monitoring more than 100 elections around the world; helping virtually eliminate Guinea worm disease, an infection that had haunted Africa for centuries; becoming the only former president to earn a Nobel Peace Prize; and building or repairing thousands of homes in more than a dozen countries with his beloved Rosalynn as part of Habitat for Humanity.",

He believed some things were more important than reelection \u2014 things like integrity, respect, and compassion. Because Jimmy Carter believed, as deeply as he believed anything, that we are all created in God's image.",

And in doing so, he taught all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service.

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 23:11:16 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I feel like we should've learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" Dr. Leana Wen said.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Leana Wen said Sunday that the lack of testing for bird flu doesn't mean that the virus isn't alive in humans, and that she feels the federal government \"should have learned our lesson from COVID\" and should be proactive in making tests available for Americans \u2014 and not wait for labs to characterize the cases and their severity.",
      "\"I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not,\" she added.",
      "The recent outbreak of bird flu stems from a mutation of the H5N1 virus that affects humans more easily, compared to past mutations of the virus that targeted birds and not mammals.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC reported its first severe case of bird flu in the U.S. found in a patient in Louisiana who was infected from a backyard poultry flock. The Louisiana case was first confirmed by health officials Friday, adding to the total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. Another severe case of H5N1 has been reported in a teen in British Columbia.",
      "According to the CDC, the mutations found in humans seemed to develop as the virus adapted to its host. The genetic changes in the H5N1 samples from the infected human were not present in the samples from the backyard poultry flock that infected the patient, suggesting that the concerning mutations had not developed until after the transmission of the virus. Federal health officials in the report said that spread between close contacts is more likely when these changes develop during the clinical course of a human infection.",
      "\"It's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors,\" Wen said\u00a0 Sunday, adding that this mutation allows a person to have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "Wen added that she believes the number of H5N1 cases currently reported in the U.S. is likely an undercount due to the lack of testing.",
      "\"We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states; 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing,\" Wen said.",
      "Wen on Sunday also urged the Biden administration to approve the H5N1 vaccine, which is already developed and contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses but awaits FDA authorization \u2013 a key difference from the beginning stages of COVID.",
      "\"There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out to farm workers and to vulnerable people,\" Wen said. \"I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility.\"",
      "The push for immediate authorization of vaccines and additional testing is rooted in concern that the Trump administration could potentially delay vaccines.",
      "\"I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence,\" Wen said. \"Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe, as we could be having for bird flu, the way that we had for COVID.\"",
      "Some of President-elect Trump's cabinet picks like Dr. Marty Makary, who is set to lead the FDA, Wen described as \"very competent\" and an \"independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges.\" There is more concern, however, over Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the controversial pick for Health and Human secretary who has spread false information on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern, in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services,\" Wen said.\u00a0 \"Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti-vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti vaccine advocates in the country, if not in the world, over the last couple of decades.\"",

      "President Biden on Sunday evening praised the late\u00a0President Jimmy Carter\u00a0as an example of \"simple decency\" in remarks hours after Carter's death at the age of 100 was announced.",
      "The president, in a brief warm tribute, emphasized Carter's humanity, saying that he had \"lived a life measured not by words, but by his deeds.\"",
      "Carter, the 39th president and the longest-living president in U.S. history, died Sunday at home in Plains, Georgia, surrounded by family.",
      "Recalling that Carter kept teaching Sunday school at the Baptist church in Plains long after his presidency, Mr. Biden, who is vacationing in St. Croix, told reporters, \"In today's world, some look at Jimmy Carter and see a man of a bygone era \u2014 with honesty and character, faith and humility. It mattered. But I don't believe it's a bygone era. I see man not only of our time, but for all times.\"",
      "\"We would all do well to be a little more like Jimmy Carter,\" the president said.",
      "Mr. Biden said what Carter represented was \"an example of ... simple decency.\" The president, who had a relationship with Carter that spanned over six decades, recalled that he was the first sitting senator to endorse Carter's 1976 presidential bid. He said, \"I told him why I was endorsing \u2014 that it was not only his policies, but his character, his decency, the honor he communicates.\"",
      "Though Carter was a governor from the South, and Mr. Biden was raised in the Northeast, the two one-term presidents had in common a strong affinity with working-class Americans. One of the things the president said he most admired about Carter was the belief they shared that \"everybody deserves an even shot.\"",
      "The president praised Carter's exemplary post-presidency \u2014 he worked for decades to eradicate disease not only at home, but also abroad, and also sought to \"enforce peace, advance civil rights, human rights, free and fair elections around the world,\" and to help with his own hands to build housing for the homeless.",
      "Carter, Mr. Biden said, \"stands as a model what it means to live a life of meaning and purpose, a life of principle, faith and humility.\"",
      "Mr. Biden also expressed admiration for Carter's own long fight against his cancer after his diagnosis nine years ago.",
      "\"Jimmy Carter was just as courageous in his battle against cancer as he was in everything in his life,\" the president said. \"Cancer is a common link between our two families,\" he added, noting that when his son Beau Biden died, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter \"helped us heal.\"",
      "\"He lost his father, his brother, his sisters, to this terrible disease,\" Mr. Biden said. He added that when Carter himself was diagnosed with cancer, \"we did our best to comfort him.\"",
      "At the end of his remarks, asked what President-elect Donald Trump should take from Carter's example, the president responded, \"Decency. Decency. Decency. Everybody deserves a shot. Everybody.\"",
      "He added, \"Can you imagine Jimmy Carter walking by someone that needs something and he just keeps walking? Can you imagine Jimmy Carter referring to someone by the way they look or where they talk? I can't. I can't.\" He added that one of the reasons the world looks to the U.S. as an example is \"we've laid out what our values are, we said we would believe.\"",
      "\"It's not just in the Declaration (of Independence that) 'we hold these truths to be self evident,' but it is a feeling,\" Mr. Biden said. The world \"looks to us, and he was worth looking to,\" he said of Carter.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 16:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "After a single term in office, Jimmy Carter's decades of humanitarian work may be his most enduring legacy.",
    "story": [
      "Elected in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, the former governor of Georgia, ran as a Washington outsider and rose to the White House with a strong sense of morality, an engineer's mind and a progressive, moderate approach to governing.",
      "Carter, who died Sunday at the age of 100, after going into hospice care\u00a0in February 2023 at his home in Plains, Georgia, served only a single term in office but devoted the decades that followed to bettering the lives of countless people across the U.S. and around the world.",
      "He faced massive crises during his presidency \u2014 sky-high oil prices, double-digit interest rates and inflation, and the Iran hostage crisis \u2014 and his failure to effectively address them resulted in his failure to win reelection in 1980. He also had some major accomplishments, including the negotiation of a peace deal between Egypt and Israel.",
      "But it is his widely lauded post-presidency, characterized by tireless peace and humanitarian efforts, that is likely to be his most enduring legacy.",
      "After leaving office in 1981, Carter became an important diplomatic figure, securing the release of political prisoners in Nicaragua in 1986 and of American Aijalon Gomes from North Korea in 2010. He served as a negotiator with North Korea during the Clinton administration, and even offered his services to then-President Trump in talks with North Korea.",
      "Along with his wife, Rosalynn Carter \u2014 who died at age 96 on Nov. 19, 2023 \u2014   he founded the Carter Center in 1982, a nonprofit human rights organization that took on as its broad mission the alleviation of human suffering. Through the work of the Carter Center, he devoted himself to preventing and resolving global conflicts, promoting freedom and democracy, and improving the health of millions of people around the world.",
      "Among other initiatives, the Carter Center oversaw efforts to conduct free and fair elections in dozens of countries in the developing world, and helped lead global efforts to eliminate Guinea worm disease, which spread through unfiltered drinking water and once sickened millions across Africa.",
      "Carter was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work in advancing democracy and human rights through the Carter Center.",
      "\"We have transformed the lives of, I would say, millions of people, primarily in the poorest and most destitute and forgotten communities in the world,\" he told CBS News' Rita Braver in a 2006 interview.",
      "The Carters also worked for decades with Habitat for Humanity to build homes for those in need. Carter first became involved in 1984 and remained active building homes with the organization for decades. The day after he fell in his Plains, Georgia, home in October 2019, leaving him with a black eye and stitches at the age of 95, Carter still traveled to Tennessee to volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.",
      "He and Rosalynn sponsored the Carter Work Project at Habitat for Humanity for over 30 years. According to the organization, the Carters have worked \"alongside 104,000 volunteers in 14 countries to build, renovate and repair 4,390 homes.\"",
      "A devout Christian, the former president also made an impact in his local community as a teacher. He taught Sunday School at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains until nearly the end of his life. He also taught at Emory University in Atlanta for nearly 40 years.",
      "Carter acknowledged that his post-presidential activities had earned him higher regard than he'd experienced in office.",
      "\"Certainly my reputation has been better in the post-presidential years than maybe in the White House,\" he said in that 2006 interview. \"But I think that when people look at back on what we did in the White House, I think there's a lot there of justifiable pride.\"",
      "Throughout his post-presidency, he was never afraid to speak out when troubled by policies of those who succeeded him in the White House. He was an early and vocal critic of the war in Iraq begun under President George W. Bush, and he opposed the Obama administration's use of drone strikes to target suspected terrorists.",
      "He criticized Trump for \"exacerbating\" racial tensions and being \"careless with the truth,\" telling CBS News' John Dickerson in 2018, \"I think I went through my campaign and my presidency without ever lying to the people or making a deliberately false statement, and I think that would be a very worthwhile thing to reinsert into politics these days.\" He added that he wished Trump well \"and I pray for him.\"",
      "Carter joined fellow past presidents in condemning the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and he marked the date one year later by writing: \"I now fear that what we have fought so hard to achieve globally \u2014 the right to free, fair elections, unhindered by strongman politicians who seek nothing more than to grow their own power \u2014 has become dangerously fragile at home. \u2026 For American democracy to endure, we must demand that our leaders and candidates uphold the ideals of freedom and adhere to high standards of conduct.\"",
      "Carter wrote 33 books, including memoirs about his life and career, as well as books on other topics like faith and aging.",
      "He and Rosalynn Carter were married for 77 years, and were known for their devotion to one another. They are survived by their four children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "I'm Major Garrett, in for Margaret Brennan.",
      "As we close out 2024, we, of course, want to look ahead to the economy, health care, immigration, so much more, as Washington ushers in a new Congress and, importantly, a new administration.",
      "We begin with a Face the Nation tradition, our year-end correspondents roundtable.",
      "Joining us, chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, congressional correspondent Scott MacFarlane, chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa, political correspondent Caitlin Huey-Burns, and senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe.",
      "It is great to have you all with us.",
      "Scott MacFarlane, I want to start with you.",
      "The new Congress will be sworn in this week. What position does Mike Johnson, the current speaker of the House, find himself in seeking reelection to that position?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It's a tenuous position. It has the prospect and promise of having high drama Friday, when they begin the new Congress January 3 by choosing the new speaker.",
      "One of the most underappreciated and underreported issues of the 2024 election was this incredibly narrow margin Republicans preserved in the U.S. House, even more narrow than the one that gridlocked them over the past two years.",
      "And, of course, the first order of business is choosing a speaker. Republicans have just one or two votes to spare on anything. That has the possibility of paralyzing things. And we saw two years ago the speaker vote was like a \u2013 it's like Gilligan's Island. It was supposed to be a three- hour vote and ended up being a multi-arc drama with many divergent characters, not including Thurston Howell.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: But here's the thing. It's just the top layer of this very treacherous cake for them is picking a speaker, because, what does this next speaker have to concede to win that post?",
      "We saw over the last two years the prior speaker had to concede positions on the pivotal Rules Committee to some contrarian voices in the Rules Committees, where bills went to die, instead of to get set up for a vote. And that's why so many Democratic votes were needed for so many pivotal things, because the Rules Committee was jammed up by contrarians.",
      "That could happen again.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert Costa, I want to turn to you, because, if he were so inclined, president-elect Trump could clarify his preference here. And that would send an important signal to those Republicans in the House majority to be still on the fence about this, yet he remains conspicuously silent.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: That decision is reflective of the dynamic right now down at Mar-a-Lago, the president's retreat in Florida.",
      "There is high drama, as Scott reports, on Capitol Hill. But, in Trump's inner circle, it's almost like the low-key second season of a TV show. That's how it's been described to me by allies of president-elect Trump. He's being guided by Susie Wiles, his incoming chief of staff.",
      "And she's created, I'm told, this atmosphere of calm when it comes to some of the nominees, the process, laying out the agenda for next year, top of the agenda, tax cuts, trying to expand those Trump tax cuts from 2017, of course, mass deportations also part of Trump's plan, a border bill as well.",
      "And you do have controversial nominees in Kash Patel for the FBI, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services, among others. But, at its core, you have a president-elect who's now comfortable with power, comfortable with the people around him.",
      "This is so different, Major, than what we saw in 2016, when we were covering that transition period. It had this theatrical element, Trump welcoming people to Bedminster for these showy appearances and interviews.",
      "Now we rarely see the president-elect. He's firing off missives at times on TRUTH Social, his platform, but he's often behind the scenes getting ready for 2025, because he's been here before. He knows what he wants to do.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Ed O'Keefe, President Biden remains president of the United States, though some Americans might have to be reminded of that fact.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What is ahead for the president in the waning days of his presidency in terms of travel and possible pardons?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Well, he is taking one final foreign trip, and it was one that we \u2013 those of us who followed him a long time anticipated might happen. And that is a trip to the Vatican to see the pope and then to see the Italian leadership as well.",
      "They have been in far closer contact than I think many people appreciate, because the pope, like the president, shares a lot of the concerns about the state of the world, about what's going on in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Conflict, climate change.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Absolutely, yes, and state of democracy and just general concern for social justice, which is\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Refugee flows, exactly.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes, exactly.",
      "And so that will be a critical political meeting, but also a real personal capstone for the second Catholic president.",
      "And it speaks as well to one of the things he's been focused on over the last several weeks and will continue to be. We're still waiting to hear more about, for example, pardons and clemency. Will there be more of those? And will they be for the everyman? Or will they be for notable political figures like, for example, Jesse Jackson Jr., the former congressman from Illinois, or others who've ended up in the legal system and maybe are well- known and are now appealing for some kind of leniency or forgiveness?",
      "And so those 37 death row clemencies that we saw before Christmas, a good example of what's to come and what he's eager to do, and also a good example of what little he can do, because, of course, Congress has no interest in working with him. They can't even really sort out what to do with themselves, but \u2013 so he's using the executive privileges that he has in these waning weeks.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jan, as you know better than anyone at this table, this last year was a clash of law and politics, unlike anything we have seen in our modern American history.",
      "The judicial system in our country, according to Gallup, 35 percent confidence, 20 percent below our peer countries, other free market democracies. How much of that is a reflection of this clash, the Supreme Court, or just a sense that our judicial system has become, in the words of someone we have all come to know, two-tiered?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: You know, that's a hard question to answer, because I think you have got a\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We always give you the easiest ones, Jan.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: But I'm going to try, Major, because I think it goes \u2013 you have got to look past just this past year and go further back.",
      "I think it really started and took off in the wake of the Dobbs decision, the court's ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. The outrage over that decision was so extreme that you saw, I think, a quite calculated effort to undermine legitimacy of the Supreme Court by Democrats, Senate Democrats, for example, hearings, stories about scandals, some of which were pretty overblown, to say the least.",
      "So, that has an impact on public opinion. The public starts to believe that this court is corrupt, that this is \u2013 it's on the take, none of which is true. I mean, this is still a court. You may disagree with their decisions. It's a very conservative court. It is not a corrupt court.",
      "These are nine justices who have very different views on how to interpret the Constitution who are kind of in this Titanic struggle over law, not politics.",
      "Even the immunity decision, I mean, that decision was so misreported to say that the court was going to save Trump from a criminal trial. No, it wasn't. That was never the decision. In fact, that decision is going to help protect Joe Biden from any future prosecution by Donald Trump if he wanted to do that.",
      "So, when we look at public opinion polls, sure, the court's taken a hit, but that's true over the years. The court often takes a hit. So do other institutions. And the court's opinion \u2013 court's public opinion remains much higher than our other institutions, including the White House, Congress, and by far the news media.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Congress at 17 percent, according to Gallup.",
      "Caitlin, Jan mentioned the Dobbs decision. One of the things that roiled through the political calendar year of 2024 was how important, how impactful would that decision be on turnout and the ultimate outcome of the election?",
      "But, as you traveled the country, you kept telling us, yes, it's an important issue, but there are other things on the minds of women voters in this country.",
      "CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: Yes, we always say that voters have the capacity to think about a lot of different things at once.",
      "And we saw, in the wake of that decision in the midterms, that was top of mind for people. It was the first way to kind of exercise their views across the country on this issue. But, this time around, voters had different ways to express their feelings about the Dobbs decision.",
      "Many of them had ballot measures in their states, a couple of those states being battleground states, that they could vote for codifying abortion rights into their state law and also vote for Donald Trump, because they believed in his views on the economy, on immigration, or at least that he could solve some of their concerns about them.",
      "And as I spoke to women across the country, as we all spent the whole year talking to voters and really listening to voters, a lot of women talked to me about how concerned they were about safety, about the economy, a lot of them responsible for their family's budgets, paying the bills, going to the grocery store, these kinds of fundamental things.",
      "And, also, it was kind of a reminder that we have been treating women as kind of a monolithic group in the wake of Dobbs. And this election showed that it's not as such, that they do care a lot about safety, the economy. Those were overarching issues, but they also do care about women's rights, abortion rights, but they just had other avenues to express that.",
      "And that's really what helped. And Donald Trump also modified his positions, at least to satisfy some of those voters, at least that I spoke to.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert, Caitlin brought up women's concerns about security. That flows through immigration.",
      "I wonder what your perspective is on this online feud that's gone on, on for the last three or four days between parts of the MAGA universe over H- 1B visas, which are essentially visas set aside for high-skilled laborers, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and nominally president-elect Trump on the side of that, hard right nativist parts of the MAGA movement using expletives on social media typically reserved for their political foes, not for those in the MAGA tent, assailing one another.",
      "What do you make of all of that?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: The coalition that lifted Donald Trump back to power included Silicon Valley executives. Elon Musk, Trump inner circle members say, deserves a lot of credit for pouring a lot of money in the final months into the campaign.",
      "But at the end of the day, this was a campaign where so many voters at rally after rally we covered were holding up signs that said \"Mass Deportations Now.\" The message was obvious, it was in your face.",
      "And for \u2013 the idea that president-elect Trump is going to back away from his immigration position because of some whisper in his ear from a Silicon Valley billionaire, it's just not happening, based on my reporting.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And, Scott, very quickly, do you think that \u2013 we have got about 30 seconds before we need to go to break. How much do you think that will be a part of the early congressional conversation?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: I think this battle over the debt limit which Elon Musk weighed in on is going to be the first throw-down of 2025 and impact the first year of Trump's term, because they're going to need Democratic votes to raise the debt ceiling.",
      "That won't satisfy the Elon Musks of the world. I'm not sure how Trump circumvents Democratic concessions for the debt ceiling.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When we come back, you know it, you love it, predictions, biggest story, things that were undercovered with our outstanding correspondents panel.",
      "We will be back in just one moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation and our correspondents roundtable.",
      "Predictions.",
      "Caitlin Huey-Burns.",
      "CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: I think the biggest story to watch this coming year is how the president-elect when he becomes president handles immigration.",
      "We talked a lot about how the economy was the overarching theme of this election. Immigration is what Trump made his not only closing \u2013 closing argument on, but his entire campaign was really rooted in immigration.",
      "So what this looks like, we saw in our polling majority support for mass deportations. What does that actually look like? And how do they handle that once we see what that looks like on television, how they have people explaining their policy, and what those stories look like because of that, and whether the base is satisfied and whether the general public gets what they voted for on that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jan, 2025 prediction.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I will go back to the court.",
      "I think that Donald Trump will probably get his fourth nomination to the Supreme Court either this year or maybe next year, when\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Because someone retires.",
      "Who?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Justice Sam Alito.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Justice Sam Alito.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: He was nominated, took the bench in 2006, after nearly two decades on the court.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert Costa.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Most importantly, Marcus Freeman and the Fighting Irish will win the Sugar Bowl on January 1.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Now, this is normally my prediction with Alabama.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: I'm stepping into your territory. But\u2026",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I'm happy to give it to you.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Governing by crisis in 2025.",
      "Ed, when we first met over a decade ago, we were covering crisis on Capitol Hill. Crisis persists. Such a handful \u2013 and Caitlin Huey-Burns as well. And Scott was there as well.",
      "Look, they only have a handful of seats in the House for the Republican majority. They can only do so much, as Scott said, debt limit battle on the horizon, spending fights. Deja vu. That culture of crisis, governing to the brink of discussions is here again.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Ed O'Keefe.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I will make the firmer prediction that, based on all that chaos, Speaker Johnson won't be speaker by the end of 2025.",
      "Did that a few years ago on Paul Ryan, and it worked. So, watch out, Speaker Johnson. Nothing personal.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Be careful, Speaker Johnson. Be advised.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But just look at \u2013 look at what faces him.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "ROBERT COSTA: \u2026 real soon.",

      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Happened right before Congress adjourned.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: It sure did. And it was a great surprise at D.C. It'll happen this year.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Scott MacFarlane.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Long before the next election, there will be some people departing Washington voluntarily. This is a challenging environment to be an elected official.",
      "They're getting thousands of threats a year on their lives, on their families. The travel is exhausting. And we're coming into a relatively polarizing moment with Trump coming back into office. You're going to see a lot of retirements in odd-numbered years, including 2025.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I think that's one reason why you're going to see Justice Alito step down.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: One of the things we also do in the year-end correspondents roundtable is dig into what was undercovered or underreported.",
      "Jan?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Undercovered and underreported, that would be, to me, Joe Biden's obvious cognitive decline that became undeniable in the televised debate.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: At the presidential debate with Donald Trump.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Unquestioned.",
      "And it's starting to emerge now that his advisers kind of managed his limitations, which has been reported in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" for four years. And yet he insisted that he could still run for president. We should have much more forcefully questioned whether he was fit for office for another four years, which could have led to a primary for the Democrats.",
      "It could have changed the scope of the entire election. Yet still, incredibly, we read in \"The Washington Post\" that his advisers are saying that he regrets that he dropped out of the race, that he thinks he could have beaten Trump. And I think that is either delusional or they're gaslighting the American people.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: President Biden has said repeatedly he was sick during the debate June 27 in Atlanta and he's always been fine and he leaves fine.",
      "That is his position, the position of many of his top aides as well, even though there is that reporting.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert Costa.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: The biggest story that's underreported, the battle for working voters across the country.",
      "I spent a lot of time this year with Shawn Fain, the head of the UAW. That's the battle of the future. Who's going to win over that person who's aligned with labor?

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Caitlin Huey-Burns.",
      "CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: I mentioned how we covered women voters, but also I think there is an aspect to which we underestimated or perhaps the public underestimated how Trump's personality wasn't as much of a burden to him.",
      "And, in some ways, it turned out to be a benefit with low-propensity voters. And talking to the Trump campaign throughout the cycle and reporting on it, they were making this bet that, if he leaned into his personality and made no qualms about it, made no apologies about it, that would kind of speak to this authenticity factor, this premium that low- propensity voters, those not inclined to participate in elections, might be inclined towards.",
      "It was a big bet. It paid off. And it will remain \u2013 the biggest question I have is whether Republicans can replicate any of that, because so much of their political wins this year are unique to Donald Trump himself.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Scott MacFarlane, underreported.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: The scope and size and political impact of these forthcoming January 6 pardons.",
      "Trump has never specified if it's everybody or just some people. Will it include people who gassed and beat police officers with baseball bats, or will it just be those who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors? He's never been pressed to specify if it's all or some. And what's the political impact?",
      "Did his voters really want that? Does he gain political capital or lose it if he pardons everyone?",

      "ED O'KEEFE: Exactly.",
      "And it's going to be more critical than ever in the coming year that we continue to explore and explain why it is they continue to do so, despite the threats of being sent back.",
      "And watch also the cooperation between a lot of those countries, especially in Central America, with the United States and the intrigue they have over the first Latino secretary of state, the most senior Latino ever to serve in an administration and in the presidential line of succession, Marco Rubio.",
      "I heard within days of the election from Latin American governments quite eager to get on the good side of Marco Rubio because they are thrilled to know there will be more attention paid to the hemisphere, as there should be.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And there will be attention paid in terms of accepting those this administration incoming intends to deport.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Last week, the U.S. reported its first severe case of bird flu found in a patient in Louisiana.",
      "For more, we're joined by Dr. Leana Wen. She is the former Baltimore health commissioner.",
      "Dr. Leana Wen, it's great to have you with us.",
      "So, bird flu, is this report out of Louisiana worrisome? And, if so, why?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN (Former Baltimore Health Commissioner): Well, it's one more sign that the drumbeat of bird flu coming closer to humans is becoming a major threat.",
      "So, we've already seen this year that there have been a number of mammalian species close to humans that now have bird flu outbreaks. We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states. Sixteen states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive.",
      "And now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing. So, we really don't know the extent of bird flu that's out there in humans.",
      "But this particular case, it's someone who is severely ill, but not only that. Researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors.",
      "Bird flu has been around for a long time, but it hasn't\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: About 30 years.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yes, exactly.",
      "But it hasn't been a major issue in humans, because while it spreads among birds, it hasn't really spread among mammals. But now there is this mutation. And there's another concern now, Major, too which is that we're in flu season, and it's possible that a single person could have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Something called reassortment\u2026",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: That's right. That's right.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2026 where things change because of one illness becoming another illness through reassortment of a mutated virus.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: That's right.",
      "And so the viruses could exchange genes. You could develop a new hybrid virus. And if you now have a virus that's more contagious and causes more severe disease, that's when it becomes a major threat to humankind.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yes, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left.",
      "The first is to get testing out there. I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that, just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there. It just means that we aren't looking for it. We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farmworkers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not.",
      "And the second very important thing is, this is not like the beginning of COVID, where we were dealing with a new virus, we didn't have a vaccine. There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost five million doses of the vaccine.",
      "However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine. There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out so \u2013 and to farmworkers and to vulnerable people.",
      "I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing?",
      "I mean, that's a possibility, and I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing and vaccines widely available, so that at least it empowers state and local health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Wen, is bird flu in humans super dangerous?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, the World Health Organization estimates that, in prior outbreaks of the bird flu, that the mortality rate is 52 percent, 52 percent.",
      "However, in the \u2013 in this most recent outbreak, it seems that most cases have been mild, and maybe some people even have asymptomatic infection. But the question is, we don't know what happens when bird flu affects more vulnerable individuals.",
      "People infected so far in the U.S. have been mainly farmworkers, who are working, presumably generally healthy, as opposed to what happens when you get to children, to pregnant women, to older individuals with chronic illnesses.",
      "We don't know how deadly, how dangerous bird flu is going to be for those individuals. And, again, that's one more reason why we don't want it to spread and acquire more mutations.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Thirty seconds.",
      "Norovirus is what you call it. Stomach bug is what I would call it. Numbers are surging. It's the holidays. What should people do to protect themselves?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Wash your hands really well, especially if you're going to buffets. Wash your hands if you're touching commonly touched surfaces before you touch your mouth, before you touch your nose.",
      "Norovirus is the most common foodborne illness here in the U.S. It's very hard to avoid once it's in your family. And, also, don't prepare food if you're having vomiting and diarrhea stomach cramps, because you don't want to spread it to other people.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise. We really appreciate it.",
      "We will have more questions for Dr. Wen when we come back, but, first, we're going to take a quick break.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with Dr. Leana Wen and a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with Dr. Leana Wen.",
      "Doctor, you talked about vaccines and testing in the context of bird flu and preparations therefore. Vaccines and testings were part of the Covid conversation and the Trump administration, when it was in charge.",
      "What level of concern do you have about some of the people appointed by President-elect Trump to incoming public health positions regarding issues of vaccine, testing, public health, efficacy?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN, (Former Baltimore Health Commissioner): I think that there are some people coming into this administration who are very competent. For example, Dr. Marty Markary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon, we have worked together for the last ten-plus years on issues like hospital medical error (ph). He's an independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges.",
      "But I have a lot of concern, and I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti- vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti-vaxing advocates in the country, if not in the world over the last couple of decades.",
      "He's also someone who has made his career from being an activist and not a scientist. And what I mean is that, if you're a scientist, even if you have deeply held convictions, you should be willing to change your mind if there are new facts that are presented.",
      "It's a fact that childhood vaccines are safe and they are lifesaving. A CDC analysis just now found that the childhood vaccination have saved over 1.1 million children's lives over the last 20 years. According to a Lancet (ph) study, childhood vaccines saved 154 million lives globally over the last 50 years. I mean these are facts. And it's very concerning to have someone who doesn't believe in the - in how science works and basic scientific principles to be in charge of our nation's preeminent scientific and medical agencies.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: With that perspective, do you believe it's more imperative than you described earlier for the Biden administration to move forward on bird flu vaccinations and testing?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, that's exactly it, I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence. Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe as we could be having for bird flu the way that we had for Covid.",
      "There's no reason why we should hold off on getting more testing. We need to know how much bird flu there is out there. We need to know if there are new mutations that are being developed. Other countries also need to know so that they can prepare as well.",
      "And I think it's a major problem that in the U.S. we have been holding back on testing and also holding back on getting the vaccines deployed that are already developed.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise. Thanking you twice. And a Happy New Year to you.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Thank you. To you, too, Major.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to the economy and what to expect in year 2025. We do so with Bank of America senior economist Aditya Bhave.",
      "Aditya, good morning. It's great to see you.",
      "I've covered a lot of presidential transitions. There's always an assessment by the outgoing president about what kind of economy he's giving to his successor. That's a political conversation. Objectively, what is the economy the incoming Trump administration inheriting?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE (Senior U.S. Economist, Bank of America): Good morning. Thank you for having me.",
      "So, we think the economy has really solid momentum going into next year. You can look at our internal card data, for example, that shows a nice acceleration in spending going into the holidays. You can also look at the TSA on airport traffic, and that looks really strong around the holiday period as well.",
      "You can also think about things via a wider lens. Start in 2022. That was a year in which GDP grew by only 1 percent. CPI inflation peaked at 9 percent. And all of the talk back then was stagflation, when, not if, is a recession going to arrive. Why are workers quiet quitting. And then you look at what happened over the following two years, right. This was quite unexpected and in a very pleasant way. Three percent GDP growth. Inflation coming down. Labor productivity moving up. So, all positives that leave us optimistic going into next year that we can continue to grow above 2 percent, albeit with somewhat sticky inflation.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is there any larger x factor in 2025 than the scale and scope of promised mass deportations of the Trump administration?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: From a market perspective, I think the two biggest issues will actually be fiscal policy and trade policy. And there's a lot of uncertainty around those as well, just as there is around immigration policy. So, with fiscal policy, you had this conversation in your last segment, right, the majority for Republicans in the House is very, very narrow. So, if they want to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they want to do more fiscal stimulus, which we think will probably eventually get done, they have a very slim margin to work with.",
      "And then with trade policy, we really need to understand, you know, how much of the tariffs that President-elect Trump has threatened are actually going to be implemented versus how much is a negotiating tool, right, so how much is transactional.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And for mass deportations, how much do you fear that could affect the labor market and our country, that is to say put upward pressure on prices because if there is mass deportations and workplace inspections, lots of workers in agriculture, construction, meat processing and other vital industries could be pulled out of those sectors.",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So, I think it's - our base (ph) case is that there will be a slowdown in the flow of immigrants, right? It's harder to know what will actually happen around deportations.",
      "From an economic perspective, a worker is also a consumer, so there are some down risks to economic activity if there's a large change in the population, right? That's just math.",
      "In terms of pressures in specific sectors, it's really going to depend on how things play out. Yes, there could be labor shortages in certain sectors, but it's very hard to know at this stage.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Many CEOs I listen to say that they expect the tariffs and regulatory relief to kind of wash themselves out, meaning essentially, you put them together, it's benign on the U.S. economy. Is that your perspective?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I think that's about right. If you look at the four key policy issues that we've been focused on, as I said earlier, trade, fiscal policy, immigration policy and deregulation, we think they'll roughly wash out. But again, the starting point is pretty helpful, right? So, we think that we can continue to grow at around 2 to 2.5 percent this - the coming year, as well as in 2026.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, in reading year-end summaries, \"The Economist,\" \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The Washington Post,\" all in their own way, warned that the stock market may be overvalued, may be to exuberant. Do you share any of those concerns?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I'm not an equity analyst, so it's hard for me to day, to give a specific number. Our equity strategists do think that stocks can continue to run up to around 6,600, 6,700 by the end of the year.",
      "What you can say is that, obviously, there's been a pretty aggressive run- up in tech stocks, but it is not of the same scale that we saw in the late '90s if we're really worried about a similar bubble.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What effect do you believe cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence will play in the global economy in 2025?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So, when it comes to A.I., I think there's two things to be said. The actual impact of A.I. adoption is probably going to show up pretty slowly in the data. So, I don't know that we'll necessarily see that in 2025 or 2026. It might be a story for a few years down the line.",
      "But what has been really impactful already, and probably will be much more impactful in the coming years, is just laying the groundwork for A.I., right? So, if you see the increases in investment in data centers, and you think about what all that requires, right?",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes. We need to -",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: It requires materials. It requires energy supply.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Aditya, we need to go. Pardon - pardon me.",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: It requires labor, you - you put - sure. Sure.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, I'm sorry to cut you off. We have a hard break we need to get to.",
      "Aditya Bhave from Bank of America, Happy New Year and thank you so much for being with us.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: In 22 days Donald Trump will be sworn in as the nation's 47th president, only the second to serve two nonconsecutive terms.",
      "For more perspective on the most powerful position in the world, we spoke with David Rubenstein, the co-founder and co-chairman of the Carlyle Group. His new book, \"The Highest Calling,\" studies the highs and lows of some of this country's most consequential presidents.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How would you compare, based on your study of the presidency, our unsettled times now to unsettled times past?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN (Co-Founder and Co-Chairman, The Carlyle Group): Well, nothing is as bad as the Civil War, when we had 3 percent of our population killed and the fighting in Washington was so bad that about 60 different times members of Congress hit other members of Congress on the floor of the Congress. So, we're not quite there yet.",
      "Clearly, though, we're going into some uncharted waters because we have a president coming back who had been president before. That hadn't happened since Grover Cleveland was re-elected in 1892. And Trump has got more power than I think many people would have thought by the virtue of his victory size. And I do think he's going to act like he's got a mandate and Washington is bracing for what's going to happen.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Related to that, before the election results were known, polls indicated pretty consistently that Trump supporters were afraid if Harris would win, Harris supporters were afraid if Trump would win.",
      "Based on your study of this institution, the presidency, can you recall a time where that fear of an outcome was as prevalent as it was leading into this election?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, there have been a couple times when people really were afraid that the next person coming in that was the opposite party would really hurt the country in many ways. Clearly, my former boss, Jimmy Carter, really feared Ronald Reagan. He thought that Ronald Reagan was going to do - undo many of the things that Carter had done. Obviously, Reagan won by a landslide.",
      "And you've seen other times when this has happened as well. So, for example, when FDR won the first time, Herbert Hoover could not believe that this man, Herbert Hoover, had been such a distinguished American before he was president, and while he was president he had problems, but he was a very distinguished person. He never took FDR seriously. And FDR didn't really take Hoover that seriously. He refused to really meet with him, essentially, or met with him briefly and they just didn't want anything to do with him - each other.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned Grover Cleveland. There's not a chapter in the book about Grover Cleveland. Is there anything that retroactively fascinates you about the Cleveland presidency now that Trump has returned to office, or are you similarly fascinated by the time in which he was president, the Gilded Age?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Grover Cleveland was a Democrat, a former governor of New York, very well respected, but he lost the election in 1888, and he came back in 1892. Now, one of the things we don't really know is whether a president, when he has a second term after he's been out of office, whether he'll be fresher, whether he'll bring better people in, whether he'll be more experienced.",
      "For example, Grover Cleveland's second term was reasonably successful. And, you know, maybe Trump's will be as well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: One of the things the nation struggled with this last 18 months or so was the collision of politics and the law. Do you think there are any lessons to be learned from this clash and the politics that came from the clash of trying to indict and try someone who had been president of the United States and was aspiring to that office again?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think there is a feeling among many people that it wasn't a good idea to indict the president of the United States. I think the trial in New York, where Trump was convicted, I think really helped him in his election effort. And I think there are many people who are - who are Trump supporters who believe that the indictments that came out of the special prosecutor, Jack Smith, were really political as well.",
      "And so I think there's - both sides feel that the other side is really talking past each other. The people who are in the Justice Department now feel that these indictments were fair and correct and had a special prosecutor and so forth. The Trump people believe they were completely political. I hope going forward that the Justice Department is not seen as political because one of the strengths of this country has been the rule of law, and I hope that the Justice Department that's coming in now will continue that tradition.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you have a president in mind who, based on your study, grew in your regard and a president in your mind who, based on your study, got more diminished?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Harry Truman left office extremely unpopular, very unpopular, and he was thought to be an inappropriate (ph) successor to the great FDR. Now, because of books by David McCollough and other people who have written great books about Truman, people see him as one of our great presidents because post-World War II he helped end the war because he dropped the atomic bomb, which many people say was a mistake, but ki would say many historians think it was necessary to avoid -",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And he never doubted?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: He never doubted. He never had self-doubt. Self-doubt was one of - was not one of his thing. He always believed it was the right decision. But he also was responsible for NATO, the U.N., the World Bank, the IMF, and the CIA, which he created as well. All these things he created",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And the recognition of Israel.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Yes, he recognized Israel, even though his secretary of state threatened to resign over it. So, he was a person who has really risen up.",
      "A person who's gone down, I would say, or two that have gone down a lot. One is Andrew Jackson. Remember, Democrats used to say, we're going to have a Jefferson-Jackson day dinner. You don't have that anymore because Jackson is now widely seen as being racist and very anti-Native American, and he really did many things that I think killed a lot of people, particularly in the Native American community. So, he's not really well respected today by scholars.",
      "Another person I would say is - is that - whose reputation has gone down is Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson was the great reformer after being president at Princeton, two years later he's - he's governor of New Jersey, then president of the United States.",
      "However, he now is widely seen as having done two things that were really big mistakes. One, he resegregated the federal workforce and had been integrated. Two, and this is very damaging I think as well, he - he had a stroke and with about 18 months to go, he couldn't really do what he had done before. He hid that from the public, and his wife essentially became a shadow president. She was really making decisions and deciding things that maybe he should have decided, and the public didn't know this. And that was a big problem.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You often ask biographers what question they would most want to pose to the subject of their presidential biography. Let me expand on that. If you could go to dinner with any president, who would it be, and what question would you want to make sure you got answered?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Without doubt, the greatest president and the greatest American ever is Abraham Lincoln. He was a person who - was not an abolitionist but ultimately came to free the slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation. And he also won the Civil War despite the fact that many people in the north didn't really want to fight the Civil War. They'd say, let the south go, we'll have our own country. Lincoln said, no, we're going to hold the union together. And he did that. We lost 3 percent of our population in the war, but he kept the union together and I think made the United States a stronger country as a result.",
      "We ended slavery eventually because of the 13th amendment. But, most importantly, he did it with humility. He didn't run around saying, look, I just won the Civil War. I just did the Gettysburg Address. Isn't that a great speech? He didn't do that. He didn't brag about it. He was very humble. And I think he had a sense of humor and a sense of perspective that is a really good thing for presidents.",
      "And I would like to ask him, do you have any regrets about not having freed the slaves earlier? Do you have any regrets about not getting rid of some of your generals earlier who were not very good? And he waited a couple years before he got Ulysses S. Grant in.",
      "Grant is also a person I should mention. He had the most amazing meteoric rise of almost anybody who's become president. He was selling firewood on the streets of St. Louis in 1860. The war breaks out in 1861, more or less, and eight years later he's president of the United States. I mean it's just amazing.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned humility. George W. Bush told you in your interview with him that that was the most important characteristic a president can possession. I've read other words that are important for presidents - courage, compassion, curiosity, decisiveness. Based on your study, what would you say is the most important?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think the most important thing is having a perspective that you really want to do what's right for the American people. You're not trying to make money. You're not trying to feather your own nest. You're not trying to worry about history. You're just trying to do what's best for the American people.",
      "The qualities that I admire in leaders are people who are reasonably intelligent but not geniuses. You don't have to be a genius to be a great president. People who are willing to listen to other people. People that have some humility. People that are highly ethical. Those are the qualities that I think great leaders have in any area.",
      "Overall, we've gotten some pretty talented people who have served as president of the United States. And we've been fortunate. Lincoln, Washington, FDR, Teddy Roosevelt, Jefferson, and modern day presidents, Eisenhower, among others, have had some really great attributes and the country is good and I think better off for having had good people serve.",
      "One of my concerns in the future is that because it's become so political in Washington sometimes and the fight - infighting has been so intense that I'm not sure that - as many good people want to rise up and run for president in the future as we've seen in the past.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned in your very first answer the Civil War, the greatest time of testing in our country's history. You don't have to be very aggressive online to find casual talk among Americans about another civil war. They banty it about with some frequency.",
      "How worried are you about that, and do you think the mere discussion of it creates the potential of an inevitability?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, I think there has been discussions. Some people say the red states and the blue states should separate, but I don't think that's realistic or really going to happen. I think the country realizes that we are the strongest power in the world economically, militarily, politically, culturally and, in part, because the country's got a big enough population, and in part because we have a lot of attributes in red and blue states. I don't think it's realistic. People talk about that, but I don't think that's going to happen. The country is not going to be split up the way it was in the Civil War. I just don't see that as being realistic or desirable.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is there any doubt in your mind that presidents, all presidents, must guard against bitterness, anger, resentment, some of the things that fueled their pursuit of the office in the first place? Meaning, once they got there they need to set those things aside, even though they were part of the engine?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Everybody goes through life and has ups and downs. And you get a lot of bitterness and you get resentment of people. People that are good presidents ultimately rise up above that. A lot of people criticized Abraham Lincoln for many, many things. They called him all kinds of terrible names and they did say he was barely human.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: They called him a gorilla.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Yes. And he rose above that. And I think you have to rise above it. And, hopefully, when you don't have to worry about politics anymore in a second term, for example, you can rise above all the concerns you've had. When you're president of the United States, if you carry your resentments too long, it can affect others people adversely. So, I think in the case of President Trump, for example, clearly he has some resentments, but I think overall I believe he's going to rise above that in his second term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is Richard Nixon, which you, in your book, describe as a tragic figure, almost a Shakespearean-like tragic figure, the most available cautionary tale about resentments in the presidency?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: If only Shakespeare had been alive to write about Richard Nixon, it would have been a wonderful tragedy. He's a man who's really talented, very smart. He stumbles from running for president in 1960, barely loses. Loses for 1962 in the governorship of California and comes back and is elected in 1968 against all the odds.",
      "But he resented the people that looked down on him. He resented the liberals. He resented the ivy leaguers, as he would call them. And he really, I think, took those resentments and he perpetuated them through his chief of staff, Rob Haldeman and other people. And the result was a terrible thing called Watergate.",
      "I think Richard Nixon, had he not had Watergate, I think he would have gone down as a really impressive president because they opened to China, things he did on the environment. But Watergate will be what he's remembered for.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Was he the least ethical president in our history?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I don't think there's - that's easy to say because some presidents had issues that we don't know about as much. Richard Nixon wasn't a person who was trying to make money for himself necessarily. He wasn't grafting himself into - into business deals and so forth. But I think he had some ethical failings.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The book is called \"The Highest Calling.\" Is the presidency the highest calling? Some might argue that an age defining innovation is a higher calling or being a captain of industry is a higher calling, or just being a simple CEO employing tens of thousands of people is a higher calling. Why is it the highest calling?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: The reason I called it \"The Highest Calling,\" and I had historically said that private equity, my profession, was the highest calling, but that was more tongue-in-cheek, is this. When Woodrow Wilson went to Paris to help end World War I, he was cheered by hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Parisians. And people, for the first time, realized the most important person in the United States, in the world, really, is the president of the United States. And that's been true almost since Wilson came back from Paris.",
      "When FDR was running, the world really effectively, because he was president of the United States during World War II, he was the most important person in the world for sure. And I think ever since then, because of the economic, military, political power of the United States, whoever is the leader of the United States is almost certainly the most powerful person in the world, and pursuing what I would call the highest calling because you can affect the lives of people so much more significantly as president of the United States than any other job in the world.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 29, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to the economy and what to expect in year 2025. We do so with Bank of America senior economist Aditya Bhave. Aditya, good morning. It's great to see you. I've covered a lot of presidential transitions. There's always an assessment by the outgoing president about what kind of economy he's giving to his successor. That's a political conversation. Objectively, what is the economy the incoming Trump administration is inheriting?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE, BANK OF AMERICA SENIOR ECONOMIST: Good morning. Thank you for having me so we think the economy has really solid momentum going into next year. You can look at our internal card data, for example, that shows a nice acceleration in spending going into the holidays. You can also look at the TSA data on airport traffic, and that looks really strong around the holiday period as well. You can also think about things via a wider lens. Start in 2022, that was a year in which GDP grew by only 1%, CPI inflation peaked at 9% and all of the talk back then was stagflation. When, not if, is a recession going to arrive, why are workers quiet quitting? And then you look at what happened over the following two years, right. This was quite unexpected, and in a very pleasant way. 3% GDP growth, inflation coming down, labor productivity moving up. So all positives that leave us optimistic going into next year that we can continue to grow above 2% albeit with somewhat sticky inflation.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is there any larger X factor in 2025 than the scale and scope of promised mass deportations of the Trump administration?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: From a market perspective, I think the two biggest issues will actually be fiscal policy and trade policy, and there's a lot of uncertainty around those as well, just as there is around immigration policy. So with fiscal policy, you had this conversation in your last segment, right? The majority for Republicans in the House is very, very narrow. So if they want to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they want to do more fiscal stimulus, which we think will probably eventually get done, they have a very slim margin to work with. And then with trade policy, we really need to understand, you know, how much of the tariffs that President-elect Trump has threatened are actually going to be implemented versus how much is a negotiating tool, right. So how much is transactional.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And for mass deportations, how much do you fear that could affect the labor market in our country? That is to say, put upward pressure on prices, because if there is mass deportations and workplace inspections, lots of workers in agriculture, construction, meat processing and other vital industries could be pulled out of those sectors.",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So I think it's our best case is that there will be a slowdown in the flow of immigrants, right? It's harder to know what will actually happen around deportations. From an economic perspective, a worker is also a consumer, so there are some downside risks to economic activity. If there's a large change in the population right, that's just math. In terms of pressures in specific sectors, it's really going to depend on how things play out. Yes, there could be labor shortages in certain sectors, but it's very hard to know at this stage.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Many CEOs I listen to say that they expect the tariffs and regulatory relief to kind of wash themselves out, meaning, essentially, you put them together, it's benign on the US economy. Is that your perspective?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I think that's about right. If you look at the four key policy issues that we've been focused on, as I said earlier, trade, fiscal policy, immigration policy and deregulation, we think they'll roughly wash out. But again, the starting point is pretty helpful, right? So we think that we can continue to grow at around two to two and a half percent this the coming year, as well as in 2026.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So in reading year end summaries, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, all in their own way, warned that the stock market may be overvalued, may be too exuberant. Do you share any of those concerns?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I'm not an equity analyst, so it's hard for me to say, to give a specific number, our equity strategists do think that stocks can continue to run up to around 66-6700 by the end of this year. What you can say is that obviously there's been a pretty aggressive run up in- in tech stocks, but it is not of the same scale that we saw in the late 90s. If we're really worried about a similar bubble.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What effect do you believe cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence will play in the global economy 2025?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So when it comes to AI, I think there's two things to be said. The actual impact of AI adoption is probably going to show up pretty slowly in the data. So I don't know that we'll necessarily see that in 2025 or 2026, it might be a story for a few years down the line. But what has been really impactful already, and probably will be much more impactful in the coming years, is just laying the groundwork for AI, right? So if you see the increases in investment in data centers, and you think about what all that requires, right? It requires materials. It requires energy supply\u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2013Right we need to, pardon me\u2013",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: \u2013it requires labor, sure.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: I'm sorry to cut you off. We have a hard break we need to get to. Aditya Bhave from Bank of America, Happy New Year, and thank you so much for being with us. We'll be right back in just a moment."

    "story": [
      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Dr. Leana Wen on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 29, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Last week, the US reported its first severe case of bird flu found in a patient in Louisiana. For more, we're joined by Dr. Leana Wen. She is the former Baltimore health commissioner. Dr Leana Wynn, it's great to have you with us. So bird flu, is this report out of Louisiana worrisome? And if so, why?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, it's one more sign that the drum beat of bird flu coming closer to humans is becoming a major threat. So, we've already seen this year that there have been a number of mammalian species close to humans that now have bird flu outbreaks. We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states. 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing. So, we really don't know the extent of bird flu that's out there in humans. But this particular case, it's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors. Bird flu has been around for a long time--",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: -- About 30 years--",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yeah, exactly. But it hasn't been a major issue in humans, because while it spreads among birds, it hasn't really spread among mammals. But now there is this mutation, and there's another concern now, Major, too which is that we're in flu season, and it's possible that a single person could have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Something called reassortment, that's right, where things change because of one illness becoming another illness through reassortment of a mutated virus.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: That's right. And so, the viruses could exchange genes. You could develop a new hybrid virus, and if you now have a virus that's more contagious and causes more severe disease, that's when it becomes a major threat to humankind.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yeah, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left. The first is to get testing out there. I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there. It just means that we aren't looking for it. We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not. And the second very important thing is this is not like the beginning of COVID, where we were dealing with a new virus, we didn't have a vaccine. There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses of the vaccine. However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine. There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out so- and to farm workers and to vulnerable people. I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility, and I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing and vaccines widely available so that at least it empowers state and local health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Wen, is bird flu in humans super dangerous?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, the World Health Organization estimates that in prior outbreaks of the bird flu that the mortality rate is 52%. 52%. However, in the- in this most recent outbreak, it seems that most cases have been mild and maybe some people even have asymptomatic infection. But the question is, we don't know what happens when bird flu affects more vulnerable individuals. People infected so far in the US have been mainly farm workers who are working, presumably generally healthy, as opposed to what happens when you get to children, to pregnant women, to older individuals with chronic illnesses. We don't know how deadly, how dangerous bird flu is going to be for those individuals. And again, that's one more reason why we don't want it to spread and acquire more mutations.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: 30 seconds. Norovirus is what you call it. Stomach bug is what I would call it. Numbers are surging. It's the holidays. What should people do to protect themselves?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Wash your hands really well, especially if you're going to buffets. Wash your hands if you're touching commonly touched surfaces before you touch your mouth, before you touch your nose. Norovirus is the most common foodborne illness here in the US. It's very hard to avoid once it's in your family. And also, don't prepare food if you're having vomiting and diarrhea stomach cramps, because you don't want to spread it to other people.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise. We really appreciate it. We will have more questions for Dr. Wen when we come back, but first we're going to take a quick break.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with Dr. Leana Wen. Doctor, you talked about vaccines and testing and the context of bird flu and preparations, therefore, vaccines and testing were part of the COVID conversation. And the Trump administration when it was in charge. What level of concern do you have about some of the people appointed by President-elect Trump to incoming public health positions regarding issues of vaccine testing, public health efficacy.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: I think that there are some people coming into this administration who are very competent. For example, Dr. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon. We have worked together for the last 10 plus years on issues like hospital- medical ERM.\u00a0 He's an independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges. But I have a lot of concern, and I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern, in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti vaccine advocates in the country, if not in the world, over the last couple of decades. He's also someone who has made his career from being an activist and not a scientist. And what I mean is that if you're a scientist, even if you have deeply held convictions, you should be willing to change your mind. If there are new facts that are presented. It's a fact that childhood vaccines are safe and they are life saving. A CDC analysis just now found that the childhood vaccinations have saved over 1.1 million children's lives over the last 20 years. According to a Lancet study, childhood vaccines have saved 154 million lives globally over the last 50 years. I mean, these are facts, and it's very concerning to have someone who doesn't believe in the- in how science works, in basic scientific principles, to be in charge of our nation's preeminent scientific and medical agencies.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: With that perspective, do you believe it's more imperative than you described earlier, for the Biden administration to move forward on bird flu vaccinations and testing?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, that's exactly it. I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence. Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe, as we could be having for bird flu, the way that we had for COVID. There's no reason why we should hold off on getting more testing. We need to know how much bird flu there is out there. We need to know if there are new mutations that are being developed other countries also need to know so that they can prepare as well. And I think it's a major problem that in the US, we have been holding back on testing and also holding back on getting the vaccines deployed that are already developed.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise, thanking you twice and a Happy New Year to you.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Thank you to you too, Major."

      "That's because a black moon is the term for the second new moon to fall in a single calendar month, and new moons appear invisible to the naked eye from Earth. While new moons happen throughout the year, two new moons only fall in a single calendar month about once every 29 months, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",

      "Those hoping to catch another black moon won't have to wait too long, as there are actually several types of black moons, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. Some people use the term to refer to the third new moon in a season that has four new moons. This type of black moon is rarer than the more common definition, occurring once every 33 months. The next black moon under this definition will be on Aug. 23.",
      "The term black moon can also be used when there are no new moons in a month, which can only happen in February because of its short length. This only happens every 19 years or so, with the next one in 2033, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",

      "A new plant bug species was named after Vice President Kamala Harris (P. kamalaharrisae) and another after Harrison Ford (P. harrisonfordi) for their commitments to climate and conservation science, said California Academy of Sciences researcher Brad Balukjian, who introduced 17 new species in the Pseudoloxops family from French Polynesia.",

The California Academy of Sciences said their scientists made findings across six continents and three oceans, which led to describing 138 new animal, plant and fungi species.",
      "\"Finding and describing new species is vital for understanding the biodiversity of our planet and protecting it from further loss,\" said virologist Shannon Bennett, chief of science for the California Academy of Sciences.",
      "The number of new species identified in 2024 cannot be tallied or determined by one list. Researchers present their findings in various papers, conferences and among the scientific community. Inclusion is made tricker because discoveries can be made by anyone, anywhere, but describing and identifying a new species requires a scientific process.",
      "That process involves study and analysis of the new specimen and similar organisms, and then assigning the species a new name. A species can be discovered, but may not necessarily be described until years later.",

      "According to\u00a0a report from WWF, 234 species were identified this year in the Greater Mekong region, which includes Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Among them was Hylomys macarong, a vampire hedgehog. The soft-furred hedgehog with fang-like teeth inspired its scientific name. The word Ma c\u00e0 r\u1ed3ng is Vietnamese for \"vampire.\"",
      "First photographed in 2009 in the wild in Vietnam by a team from the Russian Vietnamese Research Centre, the vampire hedgehog was identified as a new species as part of an international effort to revise the taxonomy of lesser gymnures, the WWF said.",
      "Specimens that helped lead to the description of the vampire hedgehog were housed in the Smithsonian, researcher Arlo Hinckley told WWF. He stressed the importance of maintaining collected specimens from \"poorly sampled regions\" in order for \"the next generation\" of researchers to make new discoveries that may have been overlooked.",
      "Pygmy pipehorse, found off the coast of South Africa",
      "Researchers at the California Academy of Scientists knew they might discover something new after local divers in South Africa's Sodwana Bay told them about an unfamiliar species. But scientists were worried they would not be able to spot the tiny pygmy pipehorse \u2014 about the size of a golf tee.",
      "\"South African reefs present notoriously difficult diving conditions with rough weather and intense, choppy waves \u2014 we knew we only had one dive to find it,\" said scientist and study co-author Richard Smith in a news release earlier this month.",
      "But Smith and Graham Short \u2014 the scientist who originally described the pygmy pipehorse genus Cylix in 2021 \u2014 were undeterred, according to the academy. Originally the pygmy pipehorse was found in the cool temperate waters surrounding the North Island of New Zealand. Discovering a new species in subtropical waters expanded the range of the group.",

    "summary": "Tahlequah has a newborn girl, years after she made headlines for carrying her dead calf for 17 days.",
    "story": [
      "An orca who made headlines in 2018 after she carried her dead calf on her head for more than two weeks and a distance of 1,000 miles has given birth again, according to the Center for Whale Research.",
      "The killer whale calf was spotted in the Puget Sound area off Washington state several days ago. On Tuesday, the center determined J35, also known as Tahlequah, was the baby's mother. The calf, a girl, was given the designation J61.",
      "It's not all good news for the mom and baby though.",
      "\"The team, including multiple experienced killer whale researchers, have expressed concern about the calf's health based on the behavior of both J35 and J61,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Early life is always dangerous for new calves, with a very high mortality rate in the first year. J35 is an experienced mother, and we hope that she is able to keep J61 alive through these difficult early days.\"",
      "The organization, which tracks southern resident orca populations in the Pacific Northwest, did not specify what sparked the concern. Seattle-based Orca Conservancy wrote on social media that researchers believe the calf was born prematurely. Orca Conservancy said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been able to spend time on the water with the calf and they observed the baby \"remaining underwater for extended amounts of time indicating nursing or attempts to nurse.\"",
      "\"The calf had also been observed being pushed around on J35's head and was not looking lively, which is a concern, but also added calf behavior is not fully understood,\" Orca Conservancy wrote.",
      "Tahlequah also\u00a0gave birth to a calf in 2020. Experts at the time described it as big news, because up to 70% of orca pregnancies end with a either a miscarriage or a calf that dies shortly after birth.",
      "Southern resident killer whales, like Tahlequah, are the only endangered population of killer whales in the U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The summer population census for 2020 counted only 72 southern resident killer whales, though several calves have been born since the census. Though a recovery plan was completed in 2008, the population continues to struggle and has declined over 10% since 2005.",
      "\"The Southern Resident killer whale population needs ample access to their food supply, mainly salmon, to survive and thrive,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Every single birth counts and these whales need enough fish to be able to support themselves and their calves. We continue to advocate for salmon recovery through habitat restoration, removal of dams, and rational management of fisheries in the Pacific Northwest.\"",

      "That's because a black moon is the term for the second new moon to fall in a single calendar month, and new moons appear invisible to the naked eye from Earth. While new moons happen throughout the year, two new moons only fall in a single calendar month about once every 29 months, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "The moon will gradually become more visible in the coming days, reaching its first-quarter stage by Jan. 6 and becoming a full moon by Jan. 13, according to NASA.",
      "Those hoping to catch another black moon won't have to wait too long, as there are actually several types of black moons, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. Some people use the term to refer to the third new moon in a season that has four new moons. This type of black moon is rarer than the more common definition, occurring once every 33 months. The next black moon under this definition will be on Aug. 23.",
      "The term black moon can also be used when there are no new moons in a month, which can only happen in February because of its short length. This only happens every 19 years or so, with the next one in 2033, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "Some even use the term black moon to refer to every new moon, since at that phase, the illuminated face of the moon can't be seen from Earth.",
      "Most months have one full moon and one new moon because the lunar calendar largely lines up with a calendar year. But just as it's possible for there to be two new moons in a single month, there can also be two full moons, with the second full moon in a single month considered a blue moon. Similar to how black moon can have more than one meaning, blue moon also refers to the third full moon in a season with four full moons.",
      "There are no monthly or seasonal blue moons in 2025, according to TimeAndDate.com. The next monthly blue moon is on May 31, 2026 and the next seasonal blue moon will fall on May 20, 2027, with dates varying depending on time zone.",

People across the United States should be able to see the moon covering Mars before the red planet eventually shows itself again.",
      "March 14: Total lunar eclipse and Blood Moon",
      "A total lunar eclipse will occur March 14, the first of two in 2025 but the only one that will be visible in North America. During a total lunar eclipse, Earth passes between the moon and the sun, and for a time all three are perfectly aligned. The planet casts a shadow onto the moon and prevents most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "This eclipse coincides with the Blood Moon, where the moon bears a reddish hue. The phenomenon happens because some sunlight does filter through Earth's atmosphere and reach the moon during a total lunar eclipse, but in the case of a Blood Moon, only colors with longer wavelengths, like red and orange, actually make it there.",
      "March 29: Partial solar eclipse",
      "A partial solar eclipse will take shape a couple weeks later, on March 29. Like the lunar eclipse preceding it, this is the first of two partial solar eclipses slated for 2025, but the only one that will be visible in North America next year.",
      "The opposite of a lunar eclipse, a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, casting its shadow onto the planet as it appears to cover the star. During a total solar eclipse, like the one seen across the U.S. and Mexico last April, the moon completely blocks the sun's rays. A partial eclipse does not have the same effect, but people in some areas will be able to see the moon positioned in front of a portion of the sun.",
      "April 21: Lyrid meteor shower",
      "The Lyrid meteor shower\u00a0is active from April 15 to April 30 next year, according to the American Meteorological Society. It is expected to peak between April 21 and April 22, with people in the Northern Hemisphere most likely to spot the sparkling display.",
      "Aug. 12-13: Perseid meteor shower",
      "The Perseid meteor shower\u00a0will peak between Aug. 12 and Aug. 13. Dubbed the \"best meteor shower of the year\" by NASA, this shower typically has the capacity to produce 50 to 100 visible meteors per hour when skies are clear enough to see them and they aren't overpowered by moonlight.",
      "Unfortunately, the American Meteorological Society notes the Perseids may not be as striking in 2025 because the shower is due to happen at the same time as a waning gibbous moon, and strong moonlight could hide as much as 75% of the meteors.",
      "Aug. 12: Venus-Jupiter conjunction",
      "The conjunction of Venus and Jupiter will fall into place around the time of the Perseids peak, Space.com reports. This alignment of two of the brightest planets in the solar system will bring Venus and Jupiter much closer to each other in the sky than they usually appear.",
      "Sept. 7: Total lunar eclipse",
      "The second total lunar eclipse of 2025 will fall on Sept. 7, according to NASA. People will be able to see it in parts of Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.",
      "Sept. 21: Partial solar eclipse",

      "Oct. 7, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4: Supermoons",
      "There will be three supermoons next fall, on Oct. 8, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4. A supermoon happens when the full moon phase of the lunar cycle occurs while the moon is located at one of the closest points to Earth in its orbit. Because of the full moon's proximity to the planet, skywatchers tend to see a brighter and larger moon than they normally do. In 2025, the supermoon on Nov. 5 will appear particularly bright, since the moon will be nearest Earth at that time.",
      "Dec. 13-14: Geminid meteor shower",

      "Investigating an asteroid with Tianwen-2",
      "China's Tianwen-2 mission is an ambitious asteroid sample return and comet probe mission. Scheduled for launch in May 2025, Tianwen-2 aims to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid and study a comet. This mission will advance scientists' understanding of the solar system's formation and evolution, building on the success of China's previous lunar and Mars missions.",
      "The mission's first target is the near-Earth asteroid 469219 Kamo\u02bboalewa. This asteroid is a quasi-satellite of Earth, meaning it orbits the Sun but stays close to Earth. Kamo\u02bboalewa is roughly 131-328 feet (40-100 meters) in diameter and may be a fragment of the ,oon, ejected into space by a past impact event.",
      "By studying this asteroid, scientists hope to learn about the early solar system and the processes that shaped it. The spacecraft will use both touch-and-go and anchor-and-attach techniques to collect samples from the asteroid's surface.",
      "After collecting samples from Kamo\u02bboalewa, Tianwen-2 will return them to Earth and then set course for its second target, the main-belt comet 311P/PANSTARRS. This comet is located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.",
      "By analyzing the comet's materials, researchers hope to learn more about the conditions that existed in the early solar system and possibly the origins of water and organic molecules on Earth.",
      "Solar system flybys",
      "Besides the above planned launch missions, several space agencies plan to perform exciting deep-space flyby missions in 2025.",
      "A flyby, or gravity assist, is when a spacecraft passes close enough to a planet or moon to use its gravity for a speed boost. As the spacecraft approaches, it gets pulled in by the planet's gravity, which helps it accelerate.",
      "After swinging around the planet, the spacecraft is flung back out into space, allowing it to change direction and continue on its intended path using less fuel.",
      "BepiColombo, a joint mission by ESA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA, will make its sixth flyby of Mercury in January 2025. This maneuver will help the spacecraft enter orbit around Mercury by November 2026. BepiColombo aims to study Mercury's composition, atmosphere and surface geology.",
      "NASA's Europa Clipper mission, which launched in October 2024, will make significant progress on its journey to Jupiter's moon Europa. In March 2025, the spacecraft will perform a flyby maneuver at Mars.",
      "This maneuver will help the spacecraft gain the necessary speed and trajectory for its long voyage. Later in December 2026, Europa Clipper will perform a flyby of Earth, using Earth's gravity to further increase its momentum so it can arrive at Europa in April 2030.",
      "The ESA's Hera mission will also perform a flyby of Mars in March 2025. Hera is part of the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission, which plans to study the Didymos binary asteroid system. The mission will provide valuable data on asteroid deflection techniques and contribute to planetary defense strategies.",
      "NASA's Lucy mission will continue its journey to explore the Jupiter Trojan asteroids, which share Jupiter's orbit around the Sun, in 2025. One key event for Lucy is its flyby of the inner main-belt asteroid 52246 Donaldjohanson, scheduled for April 20, 2025.",
      "This flyby will provide valuable data on this ancient asteroid's composition and surface features, which can help researchers gain insights into the early solar system. The asteroid is named after the paleoanthropologist who discovered the famous \"Lucy\" fossil.",
      "ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE, mission will perform a Venus flyby in August 2025. This maneuver will help JUICE gain the necessary speed and trajectory for its journey to Jupiter. Once it arrives, JUICE will study Jupiter's icy moons to understand their potential for harboring life.",
      "2025 promises to be a groundbreaking year for space exploration. With NASA's ambitious missions and significant contributions from other countries, we are set to make remarkable strides in humanity's understanding of the universe. These missions will not only advance scientific knowledge but also inspire future generations to look to the stars.",

    "summary": "The Treasury Department says Chinese hackers accessed several department workstations and unclassified documents. China denies any involvement.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday.",
      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",
      "China denied any involvement, Agency France-Presse reported, citing China's foreign ministry as saying Beijing \"has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes.\"",
      "\"We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.",
      "Chinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu dismissed the allegations, calling them an effort to \"smear\" China's reputation.",
      "\"The U.S. needs to stop using cybersecurity to smear and slander China, and stop spreading all kinds of disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats,\" he said in a statement, noting that China \"itself is a target of international cyberattacks, and consistently opposes and combats all forms of cyberattacks.\"",
      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. A top White House official said Friday that the number of telecommunications companies confirmed to have been affected by the hack has now risen to nine.",
      "The Treasury Department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key \"used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support\" to workers. That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",
      "The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee.",
      "The department said it was working with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and that the hack had been attributed to Chinese culprits. It did not elaborate.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 15:20:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Luma, a private company that distributes electricity in Puerto Rico, has blamed previous \"financial mismanagement\" for problems with the island's grid.",
    "story": [
      "A massive power outage\u00a0blanketed most of Puerto Rico\u00a0early Tuesday, leaving more than 1.2 million people without electricity. Here's what to know about the blackout and Luma Energy, which handles distribution and transmission of electricity on the island.",
      "What caused the blackout?",
      "Luma Energy said in a statement that it is investigating the cause of the outage, but noted that preliminary findings point to problems with an underground line.",
      "How soon will power be restored in Puerto Rico?",
      "Luma said in a statement early Tuesday that it would likely take 24-28 hours to restore electricity across Puerto Rico.",
      "Later the company said service had resumed in some areas, including the Municipal Hospital of San Juan, but it didn't disclose how many people still lacked power.",
      "Puerto Rico's main airport, the Aeropuerto Internacional Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, said Tuesday on social media that it had activated backup power generators and was operating normally.",
      "What is Luma?",
      "Luma is a private Canadian-American company, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that operates and manages the electric power infrastructure in Puerto Rico.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which\u00a0devastated the U.S. territory\u00a0in September of 2017, the Puerto Rico government in 2021 hired Luma to handle the transmission and distribution of electricity on the island. Power was previously overseen by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which went\u00a0bankrupt in 2017\u00a0as the government faced billions of dollars in public debt payments.",
      "Luma CEO Juan Saca, a veteran telecom industry executive who was appointed to lead the company in 2023, said in a Sept. 26 hearing before a House panel that Luma has made significant investments to improve Puerto Rico's grid. That includes installing more than 17,850 hurricane-proof utility poles, adding thousands of automation devices aimed at softening the impact of power outages, and clearing vegetation around the island that can impede maintenance.",
      "\"The impact of this has been real. Over the last year, more than 95% of customers had concurrent service more than 98% of the time when generation was available,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "But Saca also sought to deflect criticism that Puerto Rico's electricity system remains unreliable, pointing to previous \"financial mismanagement.\" PREPA's bankruptcy seven years ago has also hindered progress in strengthening and modernizing the island's grid, he said.",
      "Have Puerto Ricans faced previous power outages?",
      "Puerto Rico's electric grid was troubled even before Maria, a consequence of inadequate maintenance and years of underinvestment. But the Category 4 storm crippled the system: Seven years after Maria chronic power outages and high electricity costs are common in Puerto Rico.",
      "In June, to cite one recent example, a power outage plunged more than 340,000 Puerto Ricans into darkness after two power plants on the island shut down.",
      "\"They're part of my everyday life,\" Enid N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events, told the Associated Press. Ra\u00fal Pacheco, a 63-year-old diabetic struggling with an injured foot, said he planned to sleep on his balcony during the outage.",
      "Antonio Torres Miranda, associate commissioner of Puerto Rico's energy agency, said in the House hearing this fall that the island's power distribution and transmission systems have made progress but remain subpar.",
      "\"The recent outage events of June 2024, which affected over 300,000 customers, serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of our infrastructure and the urgent need for comprehensive improvements,\" he said. \"These incidents highlight the complex interplay of aging assets, deferred maintenance and the increasing impacts of climate change on our island's power grid.\"",
      "Some critics are blunter in their assessment of Luma's record in Puerto Rico.",
      "\"Almost 25 years into the 21st century, it is ridiculous that Puerto Rico's power grid has failed its people again. Puerto Ricans deserve answers and accountability from Luma for this latest fiasco,\" Camille Rivera, founder of La Brega Y Fuerza, a grassroots advocacy group, said in a statement. \"Luma has Puerto Rico in an energy stranglehold, and Puerto Ricans shouldn't have to put up with continued subpar service.\"",

More than 1.2 million out of 1.47 million clients were without power, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees electricity transmission and distribution on the island.",
      "Luma\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0early Tuesday it would likely take between 24 and 48 hours to restore electricity across the island, \"conditions permitting,\" but a couple hours later it said service had been restored to in some areas, without providing an update on the total number of clients affected.",
      "The company said a medical center and the Municipal Hospital of San Juan were up and running again, and that it would provide further updates on the restoration of service across the island every couple hours.",
      "\"While the cause of the outage is under investigation, preliminary findings point to a failure in an underground line,\" Luma said in an earlier statement.",
      "As of 3:00 p.m., about 73,000 customers \"are currently in service,\" the company said in an update on social media. Facilities including hospitals and water and sewer authority facilities are \"energized,\" Luma said.",
      "Reuters quoted Ivan Baez, a spokesperson for Puerto Rico's primary energy generator Genera, as saying the failure of the grid was believed to have been caused by a problem with a line operated by Luma, but that it had also brought down plants belonging to Genera and some other private electricity generators.",
      "Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi said in a post on social media that his administration was communicating with both Luma and Genera \"regarding the massive blackout affecting a large part of the Island due to a critical fault.\"",
      "He said work was underway to restore electrical supply and that the government was \"demanding answers and solutions from both Luma and Genera, who must expedite the restart of the generating units outside the fault area and keep the people duly informed about the measures they are taking to restore service throughout the Island.\"",
      "Speaking to the Telemundo network late Monday, however, Josu\u00e9 Col\u00f3n, head of Puerto Rico's electric energy authority, said it could take several days to fully restore service.",
      "Puerto Rico continues to struggle with chronic power outages blamed on a crumbling power grid that was razed by Hurricane Maria, a powerful category 4 storm that struck the island in September 2017. The system was already in decline prior to the storm given years of lack of maintenance and investment.",
      "In a message posted Tuesday on social media, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose state has one of the biggest populations of Puerto Ricans in the continental U.S., said residents of the territory had been \"treated as second class citizens for far too long.\"",
      "\"The fact that, as Americans, they don't have a reliable electric grid and suffer sporadic blackouts on a continuous basis is indefensible and would not be tolerated anywhere else in the United States,\" said Cuomo. \"The federal government must finally acknowledge its responsibility to Puerto Rico  and provide the resources and expertise necessary to end this cycle of insanity once and for all.\"",

    "story": [
      "In helping instigate a heated debate over H-1B visas, Elon Musk is speaking both from personal experience and as a business owner. That's because his company, electric car maker Tesla, is among the U.S. companies that bring thousands of foreign engineers and other skilled workers into the U.S. each year.",
      "After not placing in the top 25 H-1B visa employers in prior years, Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "While well behind the likes of technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, Tesla in 2024 significantly increased its count of employees hired through the visa program, with its 742 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment more than double the 328 it recorded in 2023, NFAP found.Tesla also had 1,025 H-1B petitions for continuing employment approved in 2024.",

Musk also vowed to \"go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.\"",
      "Musk and his companies certainly aren't alone in using the H-1B program to fill out their employee ranks. The tech industry has long pushed to expand the number H-1B visas granted by the government to bring skilled workers to the U.S. from India, China, Canada, Korea, the Philippines and other countries.",
      "The program is capped at 65,000 news visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.",

      "Washington \u2014 Some of the defendants accused of being part of the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, are now asking courts for permission to return to Washington, D.C, on Jan. 20 to attend the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Many of the approximately 1,600 people who have been charged with felony or misdemeanor crimes for their alleged roles in the Jan. 6 attack have been subjected to court orders restricting their travel to and within the capital. But some have said that they should be afforded permission to return for the inauguration, arguing they are not a threat to public safety.",
      "In a court filing on Monday, the Justice Department argued against allowing defendant Christopher Belliveau to attend the inauguration. \"The last organized event the defendant attended in Washington, D.C., spiraled into a full-scale riot. This was the scene of his charged crime \u2014 a violent felony which contributed to the disruption of the peaceful transition of power,\" federal prosecutors wrote.",
      "\"The most compelling reason to deny Belliveau's motion is that allowing his travel to Washington, D.C. places Capitol Police Officers in danger,\" prosecutors added. \"Belliveau argues that his lack of violent past warrants a modification of his conditions of release. But that makes his return to the Capitol even more concerning \u2014 Belliveau was only willing to engage in violence against Capitol Police Officers who were trying to keep a crowd of rioters under control.\"",
      "Belliveau is accused of deploying bear spray against police during the Capitol attack and has pleaded not guilty. He filed his own motion in support of his request to attend the inauguration. Belliveau's attorneys argued, \"It is also vital to remember that, while Mr. Belliveau stands accused, he is presumed innocent, thus the mere fact that he is charged does not suggest that he is inherently more dangerous that any other person.\"",
      "Defendant Cindy Young, who was found guilty on four criminal charges at trial in August, has also sought permission to travel to Washington for the festivities. In her filing\u00a0on Dec. 11, Young's lawyer said she has \"complied with her conditions of release\" for \"well over a year.\"",
      "\"She poses no threat of danger to the community and she is not a risk of flight. She was allowed to travel several times to Washington, D.C., including to the Capitol building while preparing for trial and there were no incidents,\" Young's attorney said.",
      "But prosecutors opposed Young's request. Writing in response a week later, the Justice Department said Young has \"continuously endorsed calls for retribution against those involved in January 6 prosecutions \u2014 specifically jurors, judges, and law enforcement \u2014 all whom help make up the D.C. community.\" They wrote that Young \"has also mocked officer victims,\" many of whom \"will, once again, be tasked in protecting the Capitol and Constitution on January 20, 2025.\" The judge has not ruled on Young's request.",
      "William Pope, a Jan. 6 defendant who is serving as his own defense lawyer, also requested permission to attend the inauguration. In a filing on Saturday, Pope said, \"I now move the Court for permission to travel to Washington, D.C. for the purpose of attending the Presidential Inauguration on January 20, 2025. Initially, I had declined an invitation to attend the inauguration (since I don't enjoy being in Washington), however, I have now been asked a second time, and I believe it would be inappropriate for me to turn this request down.\"",
      "Pope has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial in May. The court filing did not specify who invited Pope to be in attendance. The Justice Department has not yet responded to the request.",
      "Trump has pledged to pardons at least some of those charged or convicted with crimes related to Jan. 6.\u00a0 According to the latest Justice Department report, approximately 1,000 defendants have pleaded guilty. Roughly 600 have been charged with assaulting or resisting police. There are several fugitives being sought by federal agents, with more arrests still expected.",

      "Mohammed could plead guilty as early as next week at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, if the Pentagon does not appeal the decision to the federal appeals court in Washington.

Four men, aged 18 through 20 at the time, were prosecuted and convicted for their roles in the killing.",
      "An investigation found that four men approached the victim sometime between July and August 1991, according to the news release, and drove the victim to the intersection. During that drive, the victim was tied up and pushed out of the car. One man exited the car and struck the victim on the head with a large flashlight, causing the victim's death, the news release said. The men then left the scene, but returned two weeks later to attempt to conceal the victim by placing a large wooden board over the body.",
      "The men were arrested and charged in August and September 1991, the DA's office said. One pleaded guilty in Sept. 1992 to manslaughter in the first degree. He received a sentence of just over eight years to 25 years in prison, and was released in 2009 and discharged from parole in 2016.",
      "Two others pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment in the first degree and were sentenced to over two years to seven years in prison. Both were released in 1996 and discharged from parole in April 1998.",
      "The fourth man pleaded guilty to a charge of hindering prosecution in 1993 and received a sentence of one and a half to four and a half years in prison. He was released in 1996 and discharged from parole in July 1997.",
      "Despite the investigation, the victim's identity remained unknown, even after all four men had been released from prison and discharged from parole. The body had been severely decomposed by the time it was found, making identification difficult.",

It took months, but in April 2024, DNA Labs International \"used advanced DNA testing to produce a comprehensive genealogical profile from the skeletal remains,\" the office said.",
      "That DNA profile was uploaded to public databases, and results were given to Detective Joseph Rodriguez of the NYPD's Investigative Genealogy Squad. He built a family tree and discovered an investigative lead, which was shared with the DA's office and the NYPD cold case team. Investigators began reaching out to potential family members of the victim.",
      "Through this process, investigators found that the remains were those of 30-year-old Judy Rodriguez, who had been reported missing by her family shortly after she was last seen at her daughter's first birthday party on Jan. 23, 1991. Rodriguez had two other children, and three siblings. Her parents, who raised her children after her disappearance, have died, the DA's office said.",

      "\"From what I understand, the black-eyed peas are a semblance of coins. It's supposed to be good luck,\" Bell said. \"Our tradition is to kind of take out the New Year in a very lavish way and hopefully that we're also taking that into the new year as well.\"",
      "Soul food historian and James Beard award-winning author Adrian Miller has been eating black-eyed peas during New Year's since he was a kid.",
      "\"The black-eyed peas represent coins, whereas the greens represent folding money,\" Miller said.",
      "\"My mom's from Chattanooga, Tennessee. My dad's from Helena, Arkansas. So even growing up in the suburbs of Denver, we still observe the tradition,\" Miller said.",
      "\"After doing it for 50-plus years, the results in terms of prosperity are very mixed,\" Miller said.",
      "Where did the New Year's tradition originate?",
      "\"A lot of cultures will have special foods on auspicious days. New Year's Day for us, Lunar New Year for a lot of cultures in Asia,\" said Miller. \"You're carrying on this culinary tradition that goes back at least a century or more, so you feel connection.\"",
      "Some argue the tradition is more about honoring the past than invoking future wealth, and in the case of black-eyed peas, the link goes back to darker periods.",
      "\"A lot of times, black-eyed peas and other foods from West Africa provisioned slave ships,\" Miller said, adding that enslaved Africans forced to endure the Middle Passage were fed cowbeans and yams.",
      "\"We now know that typically the enslaved were fed black-eyed pea-based dishes during the journey, including black-eyed peas and rice, which typically is often called Hoppin' John,\" Miller said.",
      "\"I think people really feel a strong connection to the past, especially to their ancestors, and given the experience of African Americans in this country, to have a time-honored tradition that people love \u2013 that's positive \u2013 I think it's something that leads people to embrace it.\"",
      "Celebrations on Dec. 31, 1862, may contain more clues about the tradition, according to The National Museum of African American History and Culture.",
      "On what became known as Watch Night, or \"Freedom's Eve,\" African Americans anxiously awaited midnight for the Emancipation Proclamation to take effect.",
      "Religious services honoring Watch Night still occur today, and according to the museum, the occasion is usually followed by a meal that includes collard greens and Hoppin' John.",
      "While researching for her cookbook, \"Gifts from the Ancestors, Vol. One, Okra and Tomatoes,\" chef Sheri L. Raleigh, from Waco, Texas, found that black-eyed peas brought about income during the Civil War. She calls the beans an emancipation food.",
      "\"Those foods helped a lot of enslaved Africans and sharecroppers be able to make their way to the North with the great migration,\" Raleigh said, making another argument for the lasting powers in the dish's soul.",
      "The New Year's tradition, she said, \"definitely is us paying homage to the ancestors for all that they endured.\"",
      "\"Even people in the North, like in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia \u2013 people who have roots from Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia \u2013 they're going to be cooking this.\"",
      "In her research, Raleigh also traced the dish's evolution once it spread across the Americas.",
      "\"They had to adapt,\" Raleigh said about African Americans who settled in different parts of the U.S. \"They had to modify based on the indigenous ingredients that they found there.\"",
      "\"You know, cooking just tells that beautiful story,\" Raleigh said. \"If you follow a recipe, it's going to give you that heritage. Ultimately, you'll be able to tie it together and we're a lot more alike than we are different.\"",
      "How many people eat black-eyed peas for New Year's?",
      "While it's unclear how many people engage in the New Year's tradition, consumption of black-eyed peas is widespread. Raleigh found that black-eyed peas also brought prosperity to women in northern Brazil, where another port received millions of enslaved West Africans forced across the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "\"This is our cultural history, and I think those things fuse together so you can identify with people.\"",
      "Raleigh trades recipes and stories with Sandra Rocha Evanoff, who lives near Seattle, Washington, but was born in Bahia state, in northeast Brazil. Evanoff chooses lentils for good luck on New Year's, as many South Americans do, but regards black-eyed peas as part of her cultural patrimony.",
      "Afro-Brazilian women prepared Acaraj\u00e9, a fritter made of black-eyed peas with Yoruba origins linked to Nigeria, to sell in Salvador, Bahia's capital. Research shows street vendors would contribute profits to their masters, but retained some for their own social mobility,\u00a0 according to research from the University of Chicago.",
      "\"Acaraj\u00e9 was a food that enslaved women in Brazil used to sell in Bahia on the streets to buy their freedom,\" Evanoff said.",
      "Evanoff even had black-eyed peas at her wedding \u2014 which her now-husband George, a White man from Tennessee who grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana, questioned at first, since their wedding was in the middle of the year, a deviation from his family's New Year's tradition.",
      "\"I told him, why not? I love black-eyed peas,\" Evanoff said.",

November and December were\u00a0particularly deadly months\u00a0for the big cats, with 10 of this year's 36 panther deaths occurring then. But it wasn't all doom and gloom for the species: A litter of three young Florida panther cubs was confirmed to be living in the Okaloacoochie Slough State Forest in August.",
      "Just between 120 and 230 adult panthers are alive in Florida, according to the\u00a0Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The highly-endangered species once lived across the Southeast, but the population was decimated, primarily by hunting, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Now, the big cats are mostly within one region of Florida, along the Gulf of Mexico, and remain susceptible to low genetic diversity, illness and habitat loss.",
      "Another huge threat to the species is cars and other vehicles. Of the 36 panthers killed in 2024, 29 were killed by vehicles, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. One panther was struck by a train. Four panthers had \"unknown\" causes of death, and just two of the cats were killed by predators, according to the commission.",

    "summary": "If you want good luck in the new year, superstition says to skip the cleaning and laundry.",
    "story": [
      "If you've got New Year's Day off and a pile of laundry or leftover Christmas clutter lying around, you might be tempted to start the New Year off with a clean home. But could you be inviting bad luck for the year ahead? Superstition warns that if you haven't gotten around to cleaning by New Year's Eve, you should avoid it until Jan. 2.",
      "Why do some people avoid cleaning and laundry on New Year's?",
      "One of the many widely discussed New Year's myths forewarns that washing clothes or laundry could cleanse you of any good fortune for the next 365 days. Similarly, taking out anything from the home that day could remove any future prosperity. An even darker superstition is that doing so could \"wash away a loved one,\" meaning somebody could die in the next year.",
      "How and where did the superstition originate?",
      "One theory attributes the superstition to China.",
      "Lunar New Year, typically celebrated in China and other Asian countries, has a similar superstition. According to Britannica, people should thoroughly clean their homes around 10 days before the new year starts in a custom called \"sweeping of the grounds\" to remove any lingering bad luck beforehand. Cleaning during the Lunar New Year, however, is thought to risk getting rid of any good luck accumulating in the home. Sweeping, taking out the garbage or even washing your hair should be avoided.",
      "Lunar New Year festivals date back thousands of years and are rooted in legends and tradition.",
      "What are some ways to get good luck on New Year's?",
      "In Spain, those celebrating the New Year eat a dozen grapes, one for each strike of the clock at midnight. According to Spain's tourism website, it's good luck if you can eat all the grapes in time. But make sure to eat all 12, the superstition goes \u2014 otherwise, the luck can go sour.",
      "In Denmark, people smash plates on their friends' or neighbors' doorsteps on New Year's Day, according to travel magazine Outlook Traveller. The more pieces that break apart, the better fortune.",
      "In Greece, they smash a pomegranate on New Year's Day to bring life and luck. The ancient Greeks believed that the fruit's seeds symbolized abundance, fertility and eternity, according to the Greek Reporter.",
      "Brazil is known for its legendary fireworks show in Rio de Janeiro, especially on New Year's Eve. In Portuguese, \"Ano novo, vida nova\" means new year, new life. Language learning program Pimsleur says that some Brazilians believe that it is good luck if you can hop seven waves at midnight. Each wave jumped over head-on is thought to grant the jumper a wish.",
      "In the U.S., it's common to celebrate the new year with a kiss at midnight. Some believe that it brings good luck and strengthens the relationship. Another American tradition is celebrating the new year with a countdown, fireworks and watching the ball drop in New York City's Times Square.",
      "Why does the ball drop in New York City?",
      "Back in the 1800s, only the rich had personal clocks and watches. So, a time ball would fall at a certain hour to inform the masses. In London, one of the first time balls went down at 1 p.m. to tell ships the time sailing down the River Thames, according to Britannica.",
      "The Times Square New Year's Eve Ball is an iteration of the time ball. The New York Times introduced the spectacle in 1907 when the city banned fireworks due to crowds. The design began as a wooden ball with lightbulbs. Now, the six-ton ball is made of crystal.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:56:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Vacancies Reform Act sets the rules for presidents to tap acting officials to fill vacancies throughout the executive branch.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to begin his second term in the White House in just a few weeks, he has suggested that he will use recess appointments to circumvent the Senate confirmation process and quickly install his picks to key positions across the federal government.",
      "The demand has been met with pushback from some Republicans, but there is another way in which Trump could place those loyal to him in high-ranking positions without Senate approval, albeit temporarily: a 25-year-old federal law that sets the rules for presidents to tap acting officials to fill vacant positions that require Senate confirmation.",
      "Enacted in 1998, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, or the Vacancies Act, limits which government employees can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and approval by the Senate.",
      "The playbook wouldn't be new to Trump, who installed \"acting\" leaders atop various federal agencies and subagencies in his first term, including the Departments of Defense and Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Some of the president-elect's nominees are likely to face headwinds in the GOP-led Senate, like Pete Hegseth, his pick to lead the Pentagon and Tulsi Gabbard, who he plans to tap for director of national intelligence. The Vacancies Act could become a key tool for Trump to ensure agencies are staffed with those loyal to him and his agenda.",
      "\"Congress has made the policy choice to have about 1,300 positions still require Senate consent,\" said Thomas Berry, a legal scholar at the Cato Institute. \"But what we have now is that any given time, half or more than half of those are filled not by Senate-confirmed people, not because Congress made that policy choice, but because the Vacancies Act can be pushed to the limit and maybe even beyond its limits, and it's so easy to have acting officers or sub-delegates essentially act in exactly the same way they would if they were Senate confirmed for years at a time.\"",
      "How the Vacancies Act works",
      "Under the Vacancies Act, there are three categories of federal workers who can temporarily fill a position covered by the law:",
      "The \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant officeAnother administration official who has already won Senate confirmationAn agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy happened and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale",
      "The \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant office",
      "Another administration official who has already won Senate confirmation",
      "An agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy happened and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale",
      "The Vacancies Act also sets a time limit for how long an acting official can serve, allowing them to fill the position for 300 days when installed at the beginning of a new administration. Temporary leaders elevated after the start of a term can remain in their role for 210 days, but that cap can be extended if a nomination is pending in the Senate. If a nomination is rejected, returned or withdrawn, the president gets another 210 days.",
      "When Trump took office after he was inaugurated the first time in January 2017, he tapped noncontroversial, longtime civil servants to serve in acting roles while the confirmation process played out, Berry said. He could do the same again for the first days or weeks after he returns to the White House on Jan. 20.",
      "But Berry said the landscape will shift as Trump's second term progresses. Eventually, there will be Senate-confirmed officials in lower-level positions and those at the highest pay grade who have served in their agencies for more than 90 days. Those officials could be then tapped for acting positions.",
      "\"The vacancies people should be more concerned about, the vacancies where Trump has a lot more flexibility, are the ones that occur in the middle of the term, not right on day one,\" he said.",
      "Presidents of both parties have installed acting officials in high-ranking positions in their administrations. But with 30 acting secretaries, Trump used more temporary leaders than those who were confirmed during his first four years in the White House, according to research from Anne Joseph O'Connell, a law professor at Stanford University who has extensively studied the Vacancies Act.",
      "How much Trump relies on the 1998 law in the early months of his second term could depend on his legislative priorities. With a Republican-controlled Congress, the president-elect and GOP lawmakers have said they plan to focus on extending Trump's signature tax reform law, portions of which are set to expire next year, as well as border security. And if a member of the Supreme Court retires, filling that seat would also be a significant priority while Republicans have a Senate majority.",
      "\"I assume, given the threat to use the recess appointments clause, that the Senate party leadership is going to work closely with the White House to get the Cabinet or most confirmed quickly through the traditional process, so then the question is, what else will the Senate make a priority?\" O'Connell said. \"The Vacancies Act offers a second-best pathway for filling agency positions.\"",
      "Since winning the White House in November, Trump has rolled out a slew of personnel picks, ranging from those who will serve in his Cabinet if nominated and confirmed by the Senate to candidates for ambassadorships to senior White House staff who do not require Senate approval. One of those candidates, former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, whom the president-elect selected for attorney general, took himself out of consideration after he came under renewed scrutiny for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, which he denied.",
      "While much of the focus is on Trump's picks for the most senior roles in his new administration, the leaders of subagencies could be filled through the Vacancies Act or through a delegation of duties to subordinates.",
      "\"That strategy can be done at these very influential positions that are just below the secretary level, and that's why you more often see pushing the boundaries of the Vacancies Act at that level,\" Berry said.",

    "summary": "Virtually all of Puerto Rico woke up on New Year's Eve to find there was no electricity, as a power outage hit the U.S. territory.",
    "story": [
      "San Juan, Puerto Rico\u00a0\u2014 A massive power outage hit nearly all of Puerto Rico early Tuesday as the U.S. territory prepared to celebrate New Year's Eve. More than 1.2 million out of 1.47 million clients were without power, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees electricity transmission and distribution on the island.",
      "Luma\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0early Tuesday it would likely take between 24 and 48 hours to restore electricity across the island, \"conditions permitting,\" but a couple hours later it said service had been restored to in some areas, without providing an update on the total number of clients affected.",
      "The company said a medical center and the Municipal Hospital of San Juan were up and running again, and that it would provide further updates on the restoration of service across the island every couple hours.",
      "\"While the cause of the outage is under investigation, preliminary findings point to a failure in an underground line,\" Luma said in an earlier statement.",
      "As of 3:00 p.m., about 73,000 customers \"are currently in service,\" the company said in an update on social media. Facilities including hospitals and water and sewer authority facilities are \"energized,\" Luma said.",
      "Reuters quoted Ivan Baez, a spokesperson for Puerto Rico's primary energy generator Genera, as saying the failure of the grid was believed to have been caused by a problem with a line operated by Luma, but that it had also brought down plants belonging to Genera and some other private electricity generators.",
      "Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi said in a post on social media that his administration was communicating with both Luma and Genera \"regarding the massive blackout affecting a large part of the Island due to a critical fault.\"",
      "He said work was underway to restore electrical supply and that the government was \"demanding answers and solutions from both Luma and Genera, who must expedite the restart of the generating units outside the fault area and keep the people duly informed about the measures they are taking to restore service throughout the Island.\"",
      "Speaking to the Telemundo network late Monday, however, Josu\u00e9 Col\u00f3n, head of Puerto Rico's electric energy authority, said it could take several days to fully restore service.",
      "Puerto Rico continues to struggle with chronic power outages blamed on a crumbling power grid that was razed by Hurricane Maria, a powerful category 4 storm that struck the island in September 2017. The system was already in decline prior to the storm given years of lack of maintenance and investment.",
      "In a message posted Tuesday on social media, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose state has one of the biggest populations of Puerto Ricans in the continental U.S., said residents of the territory had been \"treated as second class citizens for far too long.\"",
      "\"The fact that, as Americans, they don't have a reliable electric grid and suffer sporadic blackouts on a continuous basis is indefensible and would not be tolerated anywhere else in the United States,\" said Cuomo. \"The federal government must finally acknowledge its responsibility to Puerto Rico  and provide the resources and expertise necessary to end this cycle of insanity once and for all.\"",

    "summary": "Archaeologists digging in the Jordan Valley recently discovered a collection of ancient coins during this year's Hanukkah holiday.",
    "story": [
      "A rare collection of ancient coins was discovered last week by Israeli researchers, who called the find an \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle.\"",
      "The coins are more than 2,000 years old and believed to belong to King Alexander Jannaeus, the second ruler of the Hasmonean dynasty that presided over Judea in the final centuries leading up to the common era, according to the University of Haifa in Israel.",
      "Archaeologists found the hoard of about 160 of the coins during ongoing excavations in the Jordan Valley, which runs between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the eastern border of Jordan. The project is headed by researchers at the University of Haifa and the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, the university\u00a0said in a news release translated from Hebrew.",
      "The ancient coins were unearthed Friday, coinciding with the third day of Hanukkah. Researchers noted the significance of that timing, since Alexander Jannaeus descended from leaders of a revolt in 167 B.C.E. that the Talmud says led to the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem and the first celebration of the Hanukkah holiday.",
      "Each coin bears inscriptions that include an eight-pointed star and the phrase \"King Alexander 25\" written in Aramaic, one of the world's oldest known languages that originated in the region around what's now Syria and is closely related to both Arabic and Hebrew. These types of coins date back to about 80 B.C.E., according to the University of Haifa.",
      "\"The site where the treasure was discovered is, apparently, a way station, which had not been recognized in research until now,\" said Shai Bar, one of the leaders of the excavation, in a statement to the university. Bar said the station included a purification bath, used for religious ritual, and a water storage area in addition to other buildings. It's located along a main road leading to the Alexandrion fortress, built atop a mountain in the Jordan Valley by Alexander Jannaeus.",
      "Bar told the university that students and volunteers were involved in the dig that uncovered the monarch's ancient coins. He said they were particularly excited to find the trove during Hanukkah.",
      "\"This added special meaning to the holiday for them, including in the difficult days our people are going through at the moment,\" Bar said. \"I hope that the place will become a site that attracts a crowd, and will be added to the archaeological and heritage sites of our country.\"",

    "summary": "A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 skidded down the runway and crashed in a fireball in South Korea, and investigators are just beginning the process of figuring out why.",
    "story": [
      "South Korean officials have\u00a0vowed to find out what caused a Boeing 737-800 passenger jet operated by Jeju Air to crash into flames as it attempted to land over the weekend, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. Days after the crash, there were still far more questions than answers about the country's worst aviation disaster in decades.",
      "Authorities ordered an immediate inspection of all 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines \u2014 dozens of planes in total \u2014 following the crash, but there was still no clear indication as to whether a system malfunction, human error, or some combination of factors had caused the disaster.",
      "Experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing were on the ground Tuesday to inspect the crash site The plane's \"black boxes,\" which record information from the cockpit and aircraft systems, have been recovered. But officials have warned it could be months before any clear answers emerge.",
      "Here is a look at what is known about the Jeju Air crash, and some key questions emerging in the wake of the tragedy.",
      "What happened in the South Korean plane crash?",
      "Jeju Air flight 7C 2216 departed from Bangkok, Thailand, and approached for its scheduled landing Sunday at Muan International Airport in southern South Korea.",
      "After an initial failed landing attempt, the Boeing 737-800 received a bird strike warning from the ground control center. It then ascended again before trying to land a second time.",
      "Two minutes later, the plane's crew sent a distress signal and attempted to land on a different runway. The plane touched down three minutes later without lowering its nose landing gear.",
      "It skidded along the runway at high speed, overshot the end of the runway and slammed into a concrete fence, bursting into a fireball. The only survivors were two crew members rescued from the tail section.",
      "Observers say videos of the crash suggested the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble, but the landing gear malfunction was likely the main reason for the crash.",
      "South Korean Transport Ministry officials said the plane's flight data and cockpit audio recorders \u2014 the so-called \"black boxes\" \u2014 were moved to a research center at Seoul's Gimpo International Airport ahead of analysis. The ministry earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash.",
      "\"I think the cockpit voice recorder, if they're able to read that out, that will be key to unlocking this mystery,\" Robert Sumwalt, former chair of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, told CBS News.",
      "Jeju Air said the crash was not due to \"any maintenance issues,\" according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, and aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas told BBC News that South Korea's airlines were broadly deemed to follow \"industry best practice\" and that both the plane and Jeju Air had an \"excellent safety record.\"",
      "South Korean plane skidded into a fence shielding antennas",
      "Transport Ministry officials said Monday that they would examine whether the fence the plane hit \u2014 a concrete structure which housed a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact. They said they were also trying to establish whether there were any communication problems between air traffic controllers and the pilot.",
      "The positioning of the localizer antennas close to the end of the runway behind unforgiving fortifications will likely be a focus for investigators.",
      "\"Normally, on an airport with a runway at the end, you don't have a wall,\" Christian Beckert, a flight safety expert and pilot for German carrier Lufthansa told the Reuters news agency. \"You more [often] have maybe an engineered material arresting system, which lets the airplane sink into the ground a little bit\" to slow it down.",
      "Could a bird strike have caused the Jeju Air disaster?",
      "Lee Jeong-hyun, the chief of the local Muan fire department, said Sunday that a bird strike and bad weather could have contributed to the crash, but he stressed that the cause was still under investigation.",
      "According to CBS News partner network BBC News, one passenger on the flight had messaged a relative before the disaster and said a bird \"was stuck in the wing\" and that it couldn't land, but officials have not yet confirmed whether there was any bird strike.",
      "Geoffrey Thomas, the expert cited by BBC and the editor of Airline News, told Reuters separately that he was skeptical a bird strike alone could have caused the deadly crash.",
      "\"A bird strike is not unusual. Problems with an undercarriage are not unusual. Bird strikes happen far more often, but typically they don't cause the loss of an airplane by themselves,\" he said.",
      "Why wasn't the landing gear deployed?",
      "It remained unclear what, if any, engine or systems failures the flight crew might have been contending with in the last few minutes of the ill-fated flight. Experts have said video of the crash showed no apparent movement of the plane's flaps as it came down, which can help slow an aircraft, suggesting there could have been a loss of hydraulic pressure that controls the mechanical devices.",
      "The hydraulic control systems operate independently, and experts said an engine problem would be unlikely to affect their operation.",
      "The aircraft also has a manual override for pilots to lower landing gear in the event of an electronic or mechanical failure. It was unclear if the Jeju Air crew simply didn't have time to lower the nose wheels manually, or if some other factor could have prevented them from doing so.",
      "Sumwalt, the former NTSB chair, told CBS News, \"I flew 737s for 10 years as a captain, and I can say that the landing gear can be manually deployed, so the real question will be, what set up the sequence of events here? Did the bird strike set up the sequence of events where the crew got rushed and did not deploy the landing gear? I doubt that there was any sort of a malfunction with the gear, given that it can be deployed manually and through the normal means.\"",
      "A long, hard year for U.S. aviation giant Boeing",
      "The crash wrapped up a troubling 2024 for U.S. aviation giant Boeing, which has grappled with safety problems, a machinists strike and plunging stock prices.",
      "Experts say the 737-800 aircraft is a more proven model than the company's much-maligned 737 Max jetliners, which were linked to fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.",
      "\"I think it's very important to separate this crash ... from the issues that Boeing has had over the recent past,\" Sumwalt said. \"This airplane is 15 years old, so it was probably not a manufacturing issue if the airplane is that old and flew thousands of hours. It's not a design issue. So I don't think that Boeing is going to take a direct hit because of this one.\"",
      "Still, South Korean authorities said they'll conduct safety inspections on all the 737-800s operated by domestic airlines, including 39 by Jeju Air.",

      "Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding.",
      "Prosecutors also said that Payne's toxicological exams showed that his body had \"traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant\" in the moments before his death.",
      "Payne's autopsy showed his injuries were caused neither by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious.",
      "Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the possibility that Payne died by suicide.",
      "One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne \u2014 like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson \u2014 pursued a solo career.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 08:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "If 12 grapes are eaten at the stroke of midnight, Spanish tradition holds good luck will be by your side for the entire year.",
    "story": [
      "Can grapes bring you luck? Spaniards believe so, and at midnight on New Year's Eve all across the country it's a race to gobble 12 grapes all before the first minute of the year passes.",
      "The 12 grapes, which stand for the months of the year, need to be eaten one by one before the clock changes to 12:01. If the grapes are consumed, the tradition states good luck will be by your side for the entire year.",
      "Where does the tradition of eating 12 grapes come from?",
      "The origins of the \"uvas de la suerte\" tradition\u00a0are hard to trace. The idea might have begun with grape farmers in Alicante, Spain, to unload a surplus in the early 1900s, reported Atlas Obscura. Grapes are a reasonably priced crop that tends to fare well, and there are often surpluses so the fruit can be brought cheaply.",
      "Or it might have been Madrid's bourgeoisie copying the French tradition of having grapes and champagne on the last day of the year, NPR reported. But the story goes that the Madrid residents wanted to rebel against class distinctions and decided to mock aristocrats by going to Puerta del Sol to eat grapes accompanied by the sound of the bells.",
      "Whatever the beginnings were, the tradition has caught on like wildfire in Spain. Supermarket chains such as Mercadona and Super Sol advertise and sell \"uvas de la suerte\" across Spain.",
      "Mercadona, one of Spain's largest grocery chains, advertised four ways to purchase grapes for the occasion. Natural bunch grapes with seeds from Alicante add \"an element of fun to the tradition of the 12 grapes.\" The seeds provide a \"crunchy touch,\" the supermarket said. Consumers can also buy grapes without seeds, or prepackaged grapes \"specially selected and packaged with the exact amount needed for each chime.\"",
      "Prepackaged grapes allow revelers to open the grapes at the precise moment the clock changes and not worry about counting or peeling the grapes in the midst of the excitement of the celebration.",
      "Grapes can also be bought peeled and pitted in a can. These grapes are among the most popular for Spaniards due to their convenience, the supermarket said.",
      "What are the exact rules for the New Year's grape tradition?",
      "Regardless of how the grapes are purchased, eating them at midnight on Nochevieja is key to celebrating\u00a0in Spain. Celebrants need to eat the grapes before the clock chimes 12:01 a.m., and if consumed in full, tradition holds that good luck will be by your side for the entire year.",
      "Spaniards commonly choose green grapes for this tradition.",
      "Where did the idea of eating grapes under the table come from?",
      "Eating grapes under a table isn't part of the original tradition from Spain, but may be a 21st-century twist spreading on social media. TikTok users posted on social media and said they were eating 12 grapes \u2014 either red or green \u2014 under a table, in the hopes that single people who eat the grapes under a table on New Year's will soon fall in love.",
      "User @annadstoddard posted that after she ate grapes under a table she got lucky in love. Footage shows her putting a twisted napkin ring on what appears to be her partner's finger.",
      "TikTok user @helenguillen \u2014 now @helengmorales \u2014 posted in 2022 that she ate grapes underneath the table on New Year's Eve and got engaged afterward. In the video, she shows off her engagement ring.",

      "In the past, drug cartels in Mexico have often handed out gifts or bags of food to local people around the holidays, to try to improve their image or build local support. The cartels often want local people to warn them of army raids, but at the same time the gangs usually extort protection money from local residents.",
      "Videos posted on social media last week from the town of Coalcoman, in the western state of Michoacan, showed a sign at a Christmas fair thanking Jalisco cartel leader Nemesio Oseguera -- better known by his nickname \"El Mencho\" -- for the gifts.",
      "\"The children of Coalcoman thank Mr. Nemesio Oseguera and his sons, 2, 3, and Delta 1, for their noble gesture. Thank for your gifts,\" the sign read.",
      "A person speaking over a loudspeaker repeated that message, but it was unclear how much local officials were involved in or aware of the message, or whether they had approved of it. Such fairs are often in part organized by civic, neighborhood or other groups.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said Monday that local officials were being investigated for any possible links to the sign.",
      "\"Obviously we condemn these signs,\" she said. \"A criminal group cannot hold a public event to promote the acceptance of violence.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said federal prosecutors were investigating whether the town's mayor \"has ties to criminal groups, or who put this this sign up.\"",
      "\"El Mencho\" has also been indicted in the United States and the State Department just this month increased a reward to\u00a0$15 million\u00a0for his capture. Last month, the cartel leader's son-in-law was arrested in California after U.S. officials say he faked his own death to \"live a life of luxury\" north of the border.",
      "In areas of Michoacan along the border with Michoacan that are dominated by the powerful Jalisco cartel, it is not unusual to see signs of the gang's control.",
      "The cartel set up checkpoints on roads in the area, and attacked their rivals with roadside bombs and bomb-dropping drones, while at the same time donating trampolines for the children of local residents. The cartels have also obliged some local residents to join demonstrations against army operations.",
      "The Mexican government's policy of not confronting the cartels has often left local officials in the uncomfortable position of having to deal with the local gangs, and even in some cases, hand over part of the municipal budget to them.",
      "Sometimes local officials are even implicated In murders. Just last month, former prosecutor and local police official Germ\u00e1n Reyes was arrested in connection with the grisly\u00a0decapitation of a mayor\u00a0on Oct. 6. The implication was that Reyes - who was also a former military officer who, according to his official resume, retired with rank of captain in the military justice system - had somehow worked in collusion with a gang.",

      "A South Korean court issued warrants Tuesday to detain\u00a0impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol and search his office and residence over his short-lived declaration of martial law.",
      "The country's anti-corruption agency said it is investigating whether his declaration amounted to rebellion. But experts still say there is little chance of detention or searches unless Yoon is formally removed from office.",
      "The Seoul Western District Court issued warrants to detain Yoon and to search the presidential office and residence in central Seoul, according to a statement from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military authorities.",
      "Under South Korean law, the leader of a rebellion can face the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecution, but the privilege does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "Yoon's powers have been suspended since the opposition-controlled National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, which drew hundreds of troops and police officers into Seoul streets.",
      "Yoon has argued his decree was a legitimate act of governance, calling it a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which he has called \"a monster\" and \"anti-state forces\" that has used its legislative majority to impeach top officials, undermine the government's budget, and which he claims sympathizes with North Korea.",
      "The Constitutional Court is to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him.",
      "Experts said Yoon is likely to ignore the warrants. He's ignored repeated requests by investigative authorities to appear for questioning, and the presidential security service has blocked attempts to search his office and residence citing a law that bans raids on sites with state secrets.",
      "A lawyer for Yoon rejected the anti-corruption agency's request for warrants on Monday, arguing it lacked legal authority to investigate rebellion charges.",
      "The anti-corruption agency said it has no immediate plans on how to proceed with the warrants.",
      "\"Unless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,\" said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. \"Should investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?\"",
      "Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon's residence to show they are strictly and fairly carrying out their work.",
      "Park Sung-min, president of Seoul-based political consulting firm MIN Consulting, said the push for an arrest warrant is likely an attempt to pressure Yoon to cooperate with investigations.",
      "Former President Park Geun-hye, who was thrown out of office in 2017 following an impeachment over a corruption scandal, also refused to meet with prosecutors while in office. She underwent questioning by them and was arrested after the Constitutional Court removed her from office.",
      "Yoon's imposition of martial law lasted only six hours but triggered huge political turmoil, halting high-level diplomacy and rattling financial markets. Despite Yoon's deployment of troops and police, enough lawmakers managed to enter the assembly chamber to overturn it unanimously.",
      "Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the martial law enactment.",
      "Yoon has claimed he wasn't trying to stop the functioning of the assembly, saying that the troops were sent to maintain order, and also denied planning to arrest politicians. But comments by now-arrested commanders of military units sent to the assembly have contradicted this claim. Kwak Jong-keun, the commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, testified at the National Assembly that Yoon called on troops to \"quickly knock down the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.\" Kwak said he did not carry out Yoon's orders.",
      "The country's political crisis deepened last Friday, when the Democratic Party and other small opposition parties voted to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo as well over wrangling over his refusal to fill in three justice seats at the Constitutional Court. Observers say adding more justices could affect the court's ruling on Yoon's impeachment.",

    "summary": "Germany's interior minister said the man charged in the deadly attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg had \"striking signs of a pathological psyche.\"",
    "story": [
      "The German government, under fire for failing to prevent a deadly car-ramming attack on a Christmas market, said Monday that the tragedy would have been hard to prevent and said that the suspect appeared to be mentally disturbed.",
      "Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, along with security and intelligence chiefs, faced questioning by a parliamentary committee about the attack and on whether there had been missed clues and security lapses. Five people were killed and more than 200 injured in the Dec. 20 attack in the eastern city of Magdeburg.",
      "Faeser said no motive had yet been established but \"there are striking signs of a pathological psyche\" in the suspect, a Saudi-born doctor who had lived in Germany for years.",
      "She added that lessons must be learned about how to track potential attackers who don't fit conventional threat categories and who \"are psychologically disturbed and... driven by confused conspiracy theories.\"",
      "The minister argued that \"such attackers do not fit any threat profile\" \u2014 such as far-right extremist or Islamist \u2014 and warned that German security services will need \"other indicators and action plans\" to deal with them in future.",
      "The suspect, referred to as Taleb A. by German officials, has been identified by BBC News and the AFP news agency as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen. He came to Germany in 2006 and was granted refugee status 10 years later.",
      "Police arrested him at the scene of the attack in which a motor vehicle was used as a weapon \u2014 a method previously used in jihadist attacks.",
      "In 2016, an Islamic extremist\u00a0plowed through a crowded Christmas market in Berlin\u00a0with a truck, killing 13 people and injuring dozens more. The attacker was killed in a shootout days later. That same year, ISIS claimed responsibility after another attacker killed 86 people in a truck rampage in the\u00a0French city of Nice.",
      "Abdulmohsen, by contrast, has in the past voiced strongly anti-Islam views and sympathies with the far right in his social media posts, as well as anger at Germany for allowing in too many Muslim war refugees and other asylum-seekers.",
      "Faeser said there were \"tens of thousands of tweets\" the suspect had posted over the years that were yet to be fully examined.",
      "\"That explains why not everything is on the table yet,\" she said. \"Who knew about which clues and what was passed on when must be carefully clarified.\"",
      "Reuters reported that he posted rambling commentary on X, among other things blaming Germany's supposed liberalism for the death of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, and accusing police of stealing a USB stick from him and destroying a criminal complaint he had filed.",
      "Abdulmohsen, 50, is the only suspect in the attack in which a rented BMW sport utility vehicle plowed through the crowd of revelers at high speed, leaving a bloody trail of carnage.",
      "He has been remanded in custody on five counts of murder and 205 counts of attempted murder, prosecutors said, but so far not on terrorism-related charges.",
      "The state premier of Saxony-Anhalt, Reiner Haseloff, described it at the time as \"a lone attack.\"",
      "According to media reports citing unnamed German security sources, the suspect had in the past been treated for mental illness and tested positive for drug use on the night of his arrest. German media investigations of Abdulmohsen's past and his social media postings have found expressions of anger and frustration, and threats of violence against German citizens and politicians.",
      "German police have said they had contacted Abdulmohsen in September 2023 and October 2024, and then repeatedly tried but failed to meet with him again in December.",
      "According to Reuters, Holger Muench, president of the federal criminal police office (BKA), said Abdulmohsen \"made insults and even threats. But he was not known for acts of violence.\"",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who faces a general election in February, told the news site T-online that officials would \"examine very carefully whether there were any failings on the part of the authorities\" and whether any clues were missed in the run-up to the attack.",
      "Saudi Arabia said it had repeatedly warned Germany about Abdulmohsen, but according to Reuters, police said they found the accusations too vague.",
      "Ahead of February's election, the Christmas market bloodshed has reignited heated debate about immigration and security, after deadly knife attacks this year blamed on Islamist extremists.",
      "After Monday's hearing, lawmaker Konstantin Kuhle of the liberal Free Democrats said \"the federal and state authorities knew this perpetrator.\" But Kuhle said no authority had connected all the dots and that \"we do not have a complete list of all contacts with the authorities as of today.\"",
      "Faeser said that having a fuller picture of all the data would have been good but would likely \"not have prevented\" the attack.",
      "Lawmaker Gottfried Curio of the far-right and anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party was most scathing in his criticism.",
      "\"Everything was foreseeable for everyone,\" he charged. \"We have hundreds of dangerous people in this country, we let them run around.",
      "\"What we need are deportations, instead we get naturalisations. What is needed now is a change in security policy in this country.\"",

    "title": "New species, including \"blob-headed\" fish, identified across world in 2024",
    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 09:45:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Hundreds of new species across the globe were identified by scientists in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "A vampire hedgehog, a pygmy pipehorse and a \"blob-headed\" fish were among the hundreds of new species identified in 2024.",
      "The variety of species identified was quite eclectic and names for the new species crossed a broad spectrum of locations and formations \u2014 some even inspired by politicians or celebrities.",
      "A new plant bug species was named after Vice President Kamala Harris (P. kamalaharrisae) and another after Harrison Ford (P. harrisonfordi) for their commitments to climate and conservation science, said California Academy of Sciences researcher Brad Balukjian, who introduced 17 new species in the Pseudoloxops family from French Polynesia.",
      "Actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio had a new species of snake named after him. Researchers discovered the small copper-colored snake in the Himalayas and named the species Anguiculus dicaprioi.",
      "Locations where scientists discovered these species included Peru, the Ecuadorian Amazon and the Greater Mekong region in South Asia. The California Academy of Sciences said their scientists made findings across six continents and three oceans, which led to describing 138 new animal, plant and fungi species.",
      "\"Finding and describing new species is vital for understanding the biodiversity of our planet and protecting it from further loss,\" said virologist Shannon Bennett, chief of science for the California Academy of Sciences.",
      "The number of new species identified in 2024 cannot be tallied or determined by one list. Researchers present their findings in various papers, conferences and among the scientific community. Inclusion is made tricker because discoveries can be made by anyone, anywhere, but describing and identifying a new species requires a scientific process.",
      "That process involves study and analysis of the new specimen and similar organisms, and then assigning the species a new name. A species can be discovered, but may not necessarily be described until years later.",
      "Bennett told CBS News that when scientists describe a new species, they liken it to \"a coming out ball.\" For the first time, Bennett said, the species is correctly identified and finally has its place in the world.",
      "Regardless, Bennett said \"scientists estimate that we've identified only one-tenth of all species on Earth.\"",
      "Here are some of the 2024 highlights.",
      "Vampire hedgehog, a soft-furred hedgehog with \"fang-like teeth\"",
      "According to\u00a0a report from WWF, 234 species were identified this year in the Greater Mekong region, which includes Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Among them was Hylomys macarong, a vampire hedgehog. The soft-furred hedgehog with fang-like teeth inspired its scientific name. The word Ma c\u00e0 r\u1ed3ng is Vietnamese for \"vampire.\"",
      "First photographed in 2009 in the wild in Vietnam by a team from the Russian Vietnamese Research Centre, the vampire hedgehog was identified as a new species as part of an international effort to revise the taxonomy of lesser gymnures, the WWF said.",
      "Specimens that helped lead to the description of the vampire hedgehog were housed in the Smithsonian, researcher Arlo Hinckley told WWF. He stressed the importance of maintaining collected specimens from \"poorly sampled regions\" in order for \"the next generation\" of researchers to make new discoveries that may have been overlooked.",
      "Pygmy pipehorse, found off the coast of South Africa",
      "Researchers at the California Academy of Scientists knew they might discover something new after local divers in South Africa's Sodwana Bay told them about an unfamiliar species. But scientists were worried they would not be able to spot the tiny pygmy pipehorse \u2014 about the size of a golf tee.",
      "\"South African reefs present notoriously difficult diving conditions with rough weather and intense, choppy waves \u2014 we knew we only had one dive to find it,\" said scientist and study co-author Richard Smith in a news release earlier this month.",
      "But Smith and Graham Short \u2014 the scientist who originally described the pygmy pipehorse genus Cylix in 2021 \u2014 were undeterred, according to the academy. Originally the pygmy pipehorse was found in the cool temperate waters surrounding the North Island of New Zealand. Discovering a new species in subtropical waters expanded the range of the group.",
      "\"Luckily we spotted a female camouflaged against some sponges about a mile offshore on the sandy ocean floor,\" Smith said in the news release.",
      "They named the new pygmy pipehorse species C. nkosi, after the local Zulu word for \"chief,\" the academy said.",
      "\"Blob-headed\" fish baffles researchers",
      "Among eight new species of fish identified in Peru's Alto Mayor region this year, the most shocking was the \"blob-headed fish,\" according to a report published this month by the nonprofit group Conservation International.",
      "In the summer of 2022, researchers with the group's Rapid Assessment Program conducted a biological survey across a largely unstudied area in Alto May's central region and found what was later determined to be at least 27 species new to science and 49 species that are threatened with extinction, per the IUCN Red List.",
      "Among those that were new was a \"blob-headed fish\" in the Chaetostoma\u00a0genus, which includes bristlemouth armored catfish. The team's fish scientists had never seen a fish with an enlarged blob-like head, Conservation International said.",
      "\"The function of this unusual structure remains a mystery,\" researchers said in a statement.",
      "However, the species was already familiar to Indigenous Awajun people who were working with the Rapid Assessment Program, researchers said.",

      "A Chinese court sentenced a teenage boy to life in prison on Monday for murdering his classmate, capping a case that sparked a national debate over the treatment of juvenile offenders. Three suspects, all aged under 14 at the time of the murder, were accused in April of bullying a 13-year-old classmate, surnamed Wang, over a long period before killing him in an abandoned greenhouse.",

      "The Hebei case was thought to be one of the first in which the lower age limit was applied.",
      "The prosecution said that because the defendants were \"over the age of 12 but under the age of 14 at the time of the crime ... they should bear criminal responsibility\" in accordance with Chinese law.",

      "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia \u2014\u00a0At least 66 people have died after a truck plunged into a river in southern Ethiopia, a hospital director said Monday. The accident took place Sunday when an old, overcrowded truck that was contracted by wedding guests fell off the Gelan Bridge, where villagers said traffic crashes have happened before.",
      "The medical director at Bona General Hospital in the southern Sidama region, Lemma Lagide, told The Associated Press on Monday that 64 people died on site and two others at the hospital.",
      "He said those patients in need of more sophisticated critical care were transferred to a bigger hospital in Hawassa.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 07:59:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Police in Finland probing damage to undersea cables say a shadowy Russia-linked ship may have dragged its anchor for more than 60 miles.",
    "story": [
      "Helsinki, Finland\u00a0\u2014 Finnish investigators probing the damage to a Baltic Sea power cable and several data cables said they found an anchor drag mark on the seabed, apparently from a Russia-linked vessel that has already been seized for investigation.",
      "The Estlink-2 power cable, which transmits energy from Finland to Estonia across the Baltic Sea, went down on Dec. 25 after an evident rupture. It had little impact on services but followed earlier damage to two data cables and the Nord Stream gas pipelines, both of which have been termed sabotage.",
      "Finnish police chief investigator, Sami Paila, said late Sunday the trail dragged for \"dozens of kilometers... if not almost a hundred kilometers (62 miles).\"",
      "\"Our current understanding is that the drag mark in question is that of the anchor of the Eagle S vessel. We have been able to clarify this matter through underwater research,\" Paila told Finnish national TV broadcaster Yle.",
      "\"I can say that we have a preliminary understanding of what happened at sea, how the anchor mark was created there,\" Paila said, without providing further details. He also stressed that the \"question of intent is a completely essential issue to be clarified in the preliminary investigation, and it will be clarified as the investigation progresses.\"",
      "On Saturday, the vessel was escorted to inner anchorage in the vicinity of the port of Porvoo, to facilitate the investigation, officials said. It is being probed under criminal charges of aggravated interference with telecommunications, aggravated vandalism and aggravated regulatory offense.",
      "The vessel is flagged in the Cook Islands but was described by Finnish customs officials and the European Union's executive commission as part of Russia's shadow fleet of fuel tankers. Those are aging vessels with obscure ownership, acquired to evade Western sanctions on Russia amid the war in Ukraine and operating without Western-regulated insurance.",
      "Russia's use of the vessels has raised environmental concerns about accidents given their age and uncertain insurance coverage.",
      "In the wake of the cable rupture, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said last week that the military alliance, which Finland joined last year, will step up patrols in the Baltic Sea region, where tension has increased since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Finland, which shares a 832-mile border with Russia, abandoned its decades-long policy of neutrality and joined NATO in 2023, amid Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "About seven months after the Russian invasion began, a series of underwater explosions ruptured the Nord Stream pipelines that were built to carry Russian gas to Europe. The cause has yet to be confirmed, but Germany has sought three Ukrainian nationals for questioning in connection with the suspected sabotage.",
      "In late November 2024, parts of two data cables were severed in Swedish territorial waters. Ship tracking sites show the Chinese freighter Yi Peng 3 had sailed over the cables around the time they were cut.",
      "Russia responded to early speculation by European officials that the cables could have been damaged as part of hybird warfare efforts by Moscow with derision. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at the time that it was \"quite absurd to continue to blame Russia for everything without any grounds.\"",

    "summary": "South Korean officials ordered safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines as they seek to determine what caused a plane crash that killed 179 people a day earlier\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korean officials said Monday they will conduct safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines, as they struggle to determine the cause of a plane crash that killed 179 people a day earlier.",
      "Sunday's crash, the country's worst aviation disaster in decades, triggered an outpouring of national sympathy.",
      "Many people worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the disaster as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister and acting President Han Duck-soo, the country's top two officials, amid political tumult caused by Yoon's brief imposition of martial law earlier this month.",
      "New acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash and instructed authorities to conduct an emergency review of the country's aircraft operation systems.",
      "\"The essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,\" said Choi, who is also deputy prime minister and finance minister.",
      "The Boeing 737-800 plane operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air aborted its first landing attempt for reasons that aren't immediately clear. Then, during its second landing attempt, it received a bird strike warning from the ground control center before its pilot issued a distress signal. The plane landed without its front landing gear deployed, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball.",
      "Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines and now a consultant, said the Boeing 737-800 is a \"proven airplane\" that belongs to a different class of aircraft than the Boeing 737 Max jetliner that was linked to fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.",
      "But South Korea's Transport Ministry said Monday it plans to conduct safety inspections of all of the 101 Boeing 737-800 jetliners operated by the country's airlines as well as a broader review into safety standards at Jeju Air, which operates 39 of those planes. Senior ministry official Joo Jong-wan said representatives from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing were expected to arrive in South Korea on Monday to participate in the investigation.",
      "Ministry officials also said they will look into whether the Muan airport's localizer - a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings - should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "Joo said the ministry has determined that similar concrete structures are in other domestic airports, including in Jeju Island and the southern cities of Yeosu and Pohang, as well as airports in the United States, Spain and South Africa.",
      "Video of the crash indicated that the pilots didn't deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and didn;t manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they didn't have time, said John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for the barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said.",
      "Other observers said the videos showed the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They said there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problem and the suspected engine issue.",
      "Earlier Monday, another Boeing 737-800 plane operated by Jeju Air returned to Seoul's Gimpo International Airport shortly after takeoff when the pilot detected a landing gear issue. Song Kyung-hoon, a Jeju Air executive, said the issue was resolved through communication with a land-based equipment center, but the pilot decided to return to Gimpo as a precautionary measure.",
      "Local media reported that 21 passengers opted not to board an alternate flight to Jeju due to concern over safety and other reasons, Agence France-Presse reports.",
      "Ministry officials said Monday the crashed plane's flight data and cockpit audio recorders were moved to a research center at Gimpo airport ahead of their analysis. Ministry officials earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash.",
      "The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board.",
      "The crash left many South Koreans shocked and ashamed, with the government announcing a seven-day national mourning period through Jan. 4. Some questioned whether the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, such as a 2022 Halloween crush in Seoul that killed 160 people and a 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people.",
      "The Transport Ministry said authorities have identified 146 bodies and are collecting DNA and fingerprint samples from the other 33.",
      "Park Han Shin, a representative of the bereaved families, said they were told that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to their families.",
      "\"I demand that the government mobilize more personnel to return our brothers and family members as intact as possible more swiftly,\" he said, choking down tears.",
      "The crash was yet more major news for South Koreans already reeling from a political crisis set off by Yoon's martial law decree, which brought hundreds of troops into Seoul streets and revived traumatic memories of past military rule in the 1970-80s.",
      "The political tumult resulted in the opposition-controlled National Assembly impeaching Yoon and Han. The safety minister stepped down and the police chief was arrested over their roles in the martial law inforcement.",
      "The absence of top officials responsible for managing disasters has led to concerns.",

      "In January, the U.S. remained in the throes of a migrant crisis that had exploded in 2021 and continued to roil the country throughout 2022 and 2023. In December 2023, encounters at the southern border hit a new record with more than 250,000 encounters in a single month.",

As the presidential race, as well as congressional races, got into full swing in the early months of 2024, it became clear that the issue was likely to dominate the news cycle.

It would also expedite work permits for migrants and tighten asylum screening language.",

      "The agency responded to Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and 15 members of Congress who wrote to ICE in May asking for more information about the \"Alternatives to Detention\" program, which monitors illegal immigrants not in ICE detention. The agency defended the program and said it was \"an efficient and effective\" program for monitoring a segment of illegal immigrants on ICE\u2019s non-detained docket.",
      "ICE only has around 40,000 beds available at one time while it has a non-detained docket of nearly 7.7 million people, a number that has soared during the Biden administration. Of those, just over 181,000 are enrolled in the Alternatives to Detention monitoring program, where migrants are monitored either by an app check-in or a GPS monitor.",

      "But in recent years, the agency has also created separate programs to offer various services and assistance to those not in detention. In the letter, the agency says some of those programs are ending. One is the Wraparound Stabilization Service (WSS), which ICE says began in February 2020 and involves working with NGOs to offer \"services that provide psychosocial and behavioral health support for vulnerable participants and their families who would benefit from additional stabilization services.\"",
      "ICE says the program stopped referrals in July and that the program was ineffective in what it sought to do, having only a 2% higher compliance rate from those who took part in services compared to those who did not.",

      "\"ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations [ERO] notes the challenge with the WSS was its immense cost with little improvement,\" it says. \"As a result, ERO determined WSS was not cost effective enough to continue paying for these services when they did not benefit ICE or help the agency further its mission.\"",

      "The agency also says it had decided in June not to continue a vendor contract for the Young Adult Case Management (YACMP) program. That program offered 18- and 19-year-old migrants legal services, screenings, referrals to social service programs and human trafficking screenings. It started in 2023 and was present in 16 cities.",
      "\"In addition to fiscal limitations, a review of the program revealed that YACMP does not align with ERO\u2019s mission or priorities. In short, ERO took steps to realign or stop using programs to address the budget challenges facing the agency,\" the agency\u2019s letter says.",
      "The letter also provided information about the operation of the ATD tracking by app or GPS, known as the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP). ICE said 98.6% of those with court tracking appeared at their court hearings overall, while 90.4% appeared for final hearings. As of September, 13.2% of participants were being tracked by a GPS ankle or wrist device, and the average length on the program was 511.9 days.",
      "Lawmakers also asked about those who were charged or convicted of crimes while enrolled in ATD. The agency said that in fiscal 2024, there were 3,913 charges and 688 convictions for those in the program, including 10 sex offense convictions, 364 traffic offense convictions, two homicide convictions, four kidnapping convictions and 65 assault convictions.",
      "The incoming Trump administration is eyeing a substantial increase in deportations, with President-elect Trump having promised a \"historic\" mass deportation operation. Fox Digital also reported this month that it wants to reduce numbers not in detention while also increasing the use of ankle monitors on those who cannot be detained.",

The report came amid China's blocking of U.S. officials' access to the Wuhan Institute, preventing them from adequately studying the virus' origins.",

      "\"Being the only agency that assessed that a laboratory origin was more likely, and the agency that expressed the highest level of confidence in its analysis of the source of the pandemic, we anticipated the FBI would be asked to attend the briefing,\" Bannan told the Wall Street Journal. \"I find it surprising that the White House didn\u2019t ask.\"",

Ultimately, a Defense Intelligence Agency Inspector General report was commissioned to find out whether the three scientists' assessment was suppressed.",

In turn, the trio informed their counterparts, including someone at the FBI on Bannan's team, about their findings. However, in July 2021, the three scientists were told by their superiors to halt any continued sharing of their work with people at the FBI, which they were told was \"off the reservation,\" the Wall Street Journal reported.",

      "1) Unsolicited pop-ups claiming to be from Microsoft or other security services:\u00a0Janet\u2019s story highlights a common scam tactic, which is fake alerts masquerading as official warnings. Microsoft and other legitimate companies do not issue pop-ups with support numbers or direct you to download remote access software.",
      "2) Urgent audio and visual cues: Scammers create a sense of urgency with sirens, flashing messages and warnings of dire consequences to push victims into immediate action without thinking critically.",
      "3) Requests to install remote access software: Scammers often use tools like UltraViewer, TeamViewer or AnyDesk to gain access to victims\u2019 systems. While these tools are legitimate for remote tech support, downloading them at the request of an unknown party is a red flag.",

      "If you receive a suspicious pop-up, do not call the number provided or follow any on-screen instructions. Look up any suspicious phone numbers or messages independently. Use Ctrl + Alt + Del to open the Task Manager and close the browser or application displaying the message.",

Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Enable two-factor authentication, as this adds a layer of security even if someone obtains your login credentials.",

      "Why Janet didn\u2019t receive a warning from her antivirus software",
      "Janet also mentioned that her antivirus software didn\u2019t flag the scam. Unfortunately, many of these scams rely on social engineering rather than malware to bypass antivirus detection. They exploit human psychology, not just technical vulnerabilities. However, running regular scans can still help detect hidden threats.",

      "Stop all communication: Cease all contact with the scammer immediately. Do not engage further or respond to any messages or calls from them.",
      "Report the scam: Report the incident to your local law enforcement agency or the cybercrime unit in your country. Provide them with all the information you have about the scammer and the communication you had with them.",
      "Notify your bank and credit card companies: If you shared any financial information, contact your bank and credit card companies right away. Inform them about the potential scam and ask for advice on how to secure your accounts.",
      "Monitor your accounts: Keep a close eye on your bank accounts, credit cards and other financial accounts for any suspicious activity. Report any unauthorized transactions immediately.",
      "Inform credit bureaus: Consider contacting credit reporting agencies to put a fraud alert on your credit report. This can help prevent the scammer from opening new accounts in your name.",
      "Be cautious about future communications: Be vigilant regarding any future communications from unknown sources. Scammers may try to target you again using different tactics.",
      "Use identity theft protection: If a scammer gets a hold of your personal information, you may consider a service that will walk you through every step of the reporting and recovery process. One of the best things you can do to protect yourself from this type of fraud is to subscribe to an identity theft service. One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it can include identity theft insurance of up to\u00a0$1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager\u00a0helps you recover any losses.\u00a0Read more of my review of the best identity theft protection services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Janet\u2019s experience is a reminder that even the most vigilant among us can fall prey to clever scams designed to exploit fear and urgency. By recognizing red flags like unsolicited pop-ups, high-pressure tactics and requests for remote access, you can protect yourself and your personal information. If you ever encounter a situation like Janet\u2019s, remember to stay calm, verify the legitimacy of any alerts and take the necessary steps to secure your system. Scammers rely on quick reactions, so slow down, stay in control and don\u2019t let them manipulate your next move.",

      "How smart home cameras can be spying on you",
      "According to a\u00a0study conducted by Surfshark, outdoor security camera apps are some of the top offenders when it comes to collecting user data. These apps gather 12 data points on average, including sensitive details like email addresses, phone numbers, payment information and precise location. That\u2019s 50% more than what other smart home devices typically collect. What\u2019s even worse is that these apps often connect up to seven of these data points directly to your identity.",
      "Indoor security camera apps are slightly less data-hungry but still raise privacy concerns. They collect an average of nine data points, with six typically tied to users' identities. Commonly collected data includes email addresses, phone numbers, user IDs, device IDs, purchase histories and audio data. While this information can help improve the user experience, it also increases the risk of privacy violations.",
      "One of the biggest concerns with both outdoor and indoor security camera apps is the kind of data they collect. Many of these apps gather personal info like your name, email, phone number and physical address. Some apps, such as Arlo, Deep Sentinel, and D-Link, even grab data about your contacts, which can be accessed outside of the app. This data isn\u2019t actually necessary for the apps to do their job.",
      "Smart camera\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Which apps collect the most data?",
      "Among the apps that collect the most data, Deep Sentinel and Lorex stand out for outdoor security cameras, each collecting 18 out of a possible 32 data points. Nest Labs, which leads the pack for indoor cameras, collects 17 data points, with Ring and Arlo each gathering 15.",
      "The absence of regulations and standards for smart home devices creates significant privacy risks. Without clear guidelines, users are vulnerable to data breaches, cyberattacks and even physical harm. Some apps track users for targeted ads or share data with third parties and data brokers. While outdoor security cameras typically avoid tracking, indoor cameras like Nooie and Canary Connect engage in user tracking, further complicating privacy concerns.",

      "4.3 MILLION AMERICANS EXPOSED IN MASSIVE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA BREACH",
      "9 ways to stay safe from the risks associated with smart home cameras",
      "1. Limit data sharing:\u00a0Look for smart home camera apps that allow you to control what data is shared. Many apps offer settings that let you disable certain data collection features, like location tracking or audio recording. Customizing these settings can significantly reduce your risk of exposing personal information.",
      "2. Regularly review and update privacy settings:\u00a0Smart home cameras often receive software updates that may change privacy settings. It\u2019s important to regularly review the app\u2019s privacy settings to make sure they align with your preferences. Disable features that aren\u2019t essential, such as sharing data with third-party apps or advertisers.",
      "3. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA): Make sure your camera\u2019s app and associated accounts are protected by strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible: This adds an extra layer of security in case your account information is compromised.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Be mindful of camera placement: If your camera is collecting sensitive data like audio or images of people in your home, be mindful of where you place it. Avoid positioning cameras in private areas like bedrooms or bathrooms. This reduces the amount of potentially sensitive data the camera can capture.",
      "6. Consider using local storage instead of cloud services: Some cameras offer local storage options, where footage is stored directly on a device like a hard drive or SD card, rather than in the cloud. This keeps your data more secure since it\u2019s not accessible via the internet and is less likely to be exposed during a data breach.",
      "7. Use a VPN: Encrypt your internet connection with a VPN to safeguard data transmitted from your smart home devices. This is an easy yet powerful way to add an extra layer of protection to your network. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",
      "8. Regularly review privacy policies: Stay informed about how your devices and apps collect, store and share your data. Ensure that you are aware of any changes to privacy terms that may affect your information.",
      "9. Consider\u00a0home security systems with enhanced physical security features, but be aware that, like all smart devices, they collect a variety of user data, including personal information, device data and location tracking. To minimize privacy risks, here are some tips for adjusting the settings within most security system apps:",
      "Disable location tracking: The security company may use location data for features like geofencing, which triggers actions based on your proximity to your home. If you're concerned about privacy, you can disable location tracking in the app to prevent the system from collecting this data.Limit video storage: Many security company\u2019s cameras can store video footage in the cloud, but you can adjust the app settings to limit how long footage is stored or to delete it automatically after a certain period.Adjust device permissions: Review and adjust permissions for devices like cameras and smart locks to limit data collection. For example, disable audio recording if it's not necessary for your security needs.Control third-party data sharing: Your security company may share data with third parties, so it's essential to check and disable any settings that allow your data to be shared beyond your security system\u2019s ecosystem.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The rapid rise of IoT tech has changed the way we live and interact. But without proper rules in place, companies might put profits over user safety. This can lead to devices with security holes and weaknesses. A lot of smart home cameras are collecting more data than they really need and aren't clear about what they\u2019re doing with it. It could be sold to third-party companies or used to target you with ads.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says a VPN enhances online banking security by encrypting data and protecting privacy.",
      "A virtual private network (VPN) is a useful tool that allows you to mask your IP and create a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet. This means you can browse the web more privately, especially when connected to a public Wi-Fi network. Another use case for VPNs is accessing sites that are blocked in your region. For example, you could be sitting in New York and accessing content on Chinese social media platforms (though I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing that). However, a VPN can sometimes have the opposite effect, blocking you from accessing content that you were otherwise able to view.",
      "I recently received an email from Carol in Douglasville, Georgia, who asked:",

      "What is a VPN?",
      "A\u00a0virtual private network (VPN) is a secure connection method used to add privacy and security to private and public networks, like the internet and Wi-Fi hotspots. VPNs are often used to protect sensitive data and to ensure that online activities are safe from cyber threats. By encrypting your internet traffic and masking your online identity, a VPN provides anonymity and protects against hackers, snoopers and data breaches. It also allows you to access content that may be restricted based on your geographic location, making it a great tool for boosting your online privacy and freedom.\u00a0Here are 10 reasons you need a VPN at home.",
      "Why are you not able to access certain websites when using a VPN?",
      "Website owners can decide who gets to access their sites and who doesn\u2019t. Many sites block IPs from known VPNs or data centers, especially if their content is restricted to certain countries or regions.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Big platforms like Netflix or banking sites often use VPN detection tools to prevent people from accessing their services anonymously. Government websites do this, too, mostly to prevent people from bypassing regional or national restrictions. For instance, in countries with strict content rules, blocking VPNs helps prevent people from accessing content the government doesn't want them to see.",
      "But even setting your VPN to a different location in the same country doesn\u2019t always work. Why? Because some sites are trying to keep cybercriminals out. VPNs can hide your identity and location, which is great for privacy but can also be misused for fraud. Government websites dealing with things like taxes, voting or benefits need to verify who you are and where you\u2019re logging in from to prevent misuse. Allowing VPNs could make it easier for fraudsters to slip through.",
      "Another reason for blocking VPNs is to keep bots at bay. Bots can use VPNs to scrape government websites or overload their systems. Blocking VPN traffic helps protect sensitive information and makes it easier to trace and authenticate real users.",

      "Using a reliable VPN service is one of the best ways to work around VPN blocks. Not all VPNs are created equal, and choosing a high-quality provider can make a significant difference. Look for a VPN that offers obfuscated or \"stealth\" servers, which disguise VPN traffic to appear as regular internet usage, making it harder for detection systems to block you.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "A good VPN should also have a large server network with plenty of options across different locations so you can easily switch if one server is blocked. Some services even offer dedicated IP addresses, which are less likely to be flagged compared to shared ones.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "HOW TO SECURE YOUR HOTSPOT PRIVACY AND SECURITY WITH A VPN",
      "If one server isn\u2019t working, try connecting to another in the same country or region. VPN providers usually have multiple servers, and switching might help you bypass the block. If this doesn\u2019t work, use obfuscated servers. These servers are designed to hide the fact that you\u2019re using a VPN. They can bypass strict VPN detection systems, especially on government or streaming websites.",
      "To bypass VPN blocks, you can change the connection protocol your device uses. VPN protocols determine how devices link to servers, and some protocols are more adept at evading detection than others.",
      "If you're facing issues accessing specific websites, switching to a different protocol may help. For instance, some protocols offer a good balance of speed and security, while others prioritize faster performance or efficiency, potentially improving your ability to bypass restrictions.",
      "For more detailed information, it's important to research which protocols are best suited for specific use cases, as the effectiveness of different protocols can vary.",
      "WILL A VPN PREVENT APPS FROM TRACKING ME?",
      "If you only need the VPN for certain apps or websites, enable split tunneling in your VPN settings. This lets you access blocked sites using your regular connection while keeping the VPN active for other purposes. For example, you can enable split tunneling to watch a movie on Netflix using your regular internet connection while keeping your banking app secure with the VPN.",
      "Not all VPNs are created equal. Some are better at bypassing blocks than others. If your current VPN isn\u2019t working, consider switching to one that specializes in evading detection.",

There are a few ways to get around these blockers, and sometimes, it's just as easy as switching servers. You\u2019ll have the best chance of getting your VPN unblocked if you're using a reliable service.

      "Private Space is Android 15's answer to keeping your personal or sensitive apps away from prying eyes. Think of it as a secret vault within your phone where you can stash away apps you'd rather keep private, whether they're work-related, financial, or just your guilty pleasure games.",
      "Unlike hiding apps \u2014 typically done by moving them to a folder or using a third-party launcher, which still leaves them accessible from the app drawer \u2014 Private Space creates a separate, secure area within your phone that is completely isolated.

      "\"We are not happy, of course, with the proposals made by members of the Trump team to postpone Ukraine\u2019s admission to NATO for 20 years and to station British and European peacekeeping forces in Ukraine,\" the foreign minister said, though that deal has not been announced by any American officials.",
      "Lavrov said that the proposal came through \"leaks\" and Trump's recent interview with TIME Magazine, but Trump's interview did not contain any references to NATO. The foreign minister also claimed that NATO \"has been expanding its reach for many years, which became one of the primary causes of the Ukraine crisis.\"",

      "Around 100,000 individuals, according to reports, have disappeared into Assad'a prisons, where people, including thousands of women and children, were detained, tortured and killed.",
      "\"Rights groups have documented that at least 10% of those detained lost their lives in these prisons, though some reports suggest the figure could be as high as 20%,\" said Joseph Braude, founder of the Center for Peace Communications, an NGO dedicated to resolving identity-based conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, whose group gained rare access to Sednaya. \"The number continues to rise as families speak out about the whereabouts of their missing loved ones, many of whom remain unaccounted for.\"",

If you said, \u2018Sednaya,\u2019 you would end up there.\"",
      "Al Hendi continued: \"I\u2019ve heard from my friends describing the sights going into Sednaya this week. They found bags of bones, there was still fresh blood on the floor, the smell of death, and the torture machines, which were the most horrible things they\u2019ve seen. One friend told me he saw a mother hugging the torture machine, believing her son had died there. It was a tragic image, seeing her holding the machine that killed her son, thinking she could still smell him in the machine. The tools were unimaginable, like a massive metal press designed to liquefy bodies and make them unrecognizable.\"",
      "As Assad regime\u2019s atrocities at Sednaya become clearer, and after days of looking for survivors and realizing that some people may never be found, attention has shifted to mass graves. Braude\u2019s team on the ground in Syria is currently collecting evidence. \"We're documenting, we're interviewing people who are there, trying to use equipment to discover any possibility of secret underground prisons.\" He said the team had recently worked at a mass grave site \"where we estimate 100,000 people were buried.\"",
      "\"Some of the people in these mass graves came from Sednaya and died under torture,\" Al Hendi said. \"Many show gunshot wounds, and their bodies were moved to a large area where the regime placed old military equipment to create the illusion of a restricted military zone. Locals reported seeing refrigerated trucks entering the area with security forces blocking the roads. The trucks stayed for hours before leaving. People became accustomed to the smell of death.\"",

      "Sednaya prison became a symbol of the regime\u2019s relentless repression. \"It wasn\u2019t just political opponents,\" said Al Hendi,\u00a0who was arrested for establishing a secular anti-regime student organization. \"Children and women were also taken as hostages to pressure their fathers or husbands. We found children born there as a result of rape by prison guards. Entire families were destroyed by the regime.\"",
      "The conditions in Sednaya were inhumane. Prisoners were often starved, beaten and tortured with electricity. \"When they execute someone, they don\u2019t feed them for three days before the execution. The guards say, \u2018Why feed him?

Both Braude and Al Hendi emphasize the need for accountability. \"What we need now is truth and reconciliation,\" Braude says. \"Only by acknowledging the suffering and recognizing the full scope of the atrocities can Syria begin to heal. If we don\u2019t do that, we risk perpetuating cycles of vengeance.\"",
      "After the fall of the Assad regime earlier this month, Sednaya was liberated, and thousands of prisoners were freed. \"The prisoners who emerged from Sednaya were traumatized, many of them unable to even remember their own names,\" Al Hendi said. \"They had been detained for so long they didn\u2019t even know that Assad\u2019s father had died.

He emphasized the urgent need to preserve this evidence, warning, \"Time is running out. There is a small window of opportunity to secure these sites and the material they hold. Each day we fail to do so, we risk losing the chance for comprehensive accountability.\"",
      "The investigations into Sednaya and the mass graves have painted a horrific picture of the regime\u2019s violence, but they also serve as a call for justice, Braude said. \"The consequences of the Assad regime\u2019s atrocities are profound. The key question now is how the population can move forward and rebuild, rather than descending into further civil conflict. There is a fear of cycles of vengeance, but true reconciliation can only come through truth and acknowledgment.\"",
      "He said that \"99% of Syria\u2019s prison guards belong to the Alawi community.\" \"We\u2019re talking about half the young population of the Alawi sect, as most of them work in the army or secret police. The rebels have proposed a solution: Russia will surrender Assad and 100 top officials responsible for the atrocities. In return, rebels would offer amnesty to low-level perpetrators who were following orders. If Russia facilitates this, it could help prevent further violence and bring stability to Syria.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Tour operators, travel agents and cruise lines are fielding growing demand from solo female travelers, especially older women flush with disposable income.",
    "story": [
      "Women are increasingly planning leisure trips just for themselves.",
      "Nearly 40% of female travelers voiced interest in setting out solo in 2025, the tourism market research firm Future Partners found in a recent survey \u2014 up 8 percentage points from a year earlier. While men are more likely to travel alone for leisure, women\u2019s appetite for independent adventures is rising, and travel operators are working to cater to them.",
      "After launching \u201cWomen in the Wild\u201d small-group nature journeys in 2023, Natural Habitat Adventures boosted its capacity by 75% over the last year and plans to double it for 2025. The Boulder, Colorado-based company, which partners with the World Wildlife Fund on conservation-driven tourism, said it has seen especially strong demand among older women.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an emerging space that\u2019s normalizing and encouraging travel for older women, particularly for those whose partners may not be able to travel with them, or for women who have lost a partner,\u201d said Renata Haas, head of adventure operations for North America.",
      "The nonprofit travel company Road Scholar, which serves about 90,000 travelers annually and gears its tours to people over 50, said only about 20%-30% of its clients travel alone, but that subset is overwhelmingly women \u2014 at some 85%.",
      "It\u2019s become more acceptable for women to leave their families, partners or spouses behind and travel with a group of like-minded women.",
      "WanderTours CEO Beth Whitman",
      "When the company surveyed its single-booking customers, 60% were married but traveling without their spouses; 40% of its female solo guests cited different travel interests than their partners, and roughly the same share said their spouses weren\u2019t keen on traveling at all.",
      "Luxury travel network Virtuoso has also found the vast majority of its solo clients are women, at 71%. About 47% of them are divorced, separated or widowed \u2014 part of \u201ca surge in post-partner or family-raising travel,\u201d the company said.",
      "Even rustic, DIY-driven travel companies have seen demand rise among female customers. Macs Adventure, which offers self-guided hiking and biking trips with 24/7 support teams, said 56% of its solo bookers in 2024 were women, up 2 percentage points since the year before.",
      "The shift comes as airlines adjust to record travel volumes, increasingly fueled by consumers with big budgets to burn on pricey flights and a growing array of premium packages. Many of these travelers are older middle- and upper-income adults who\u2019ve watched their stock portfolios and home values climb in recent years and now feel more comfortable treating themselves.",
      "Around 15 years ago, only a handful of companies offered women-only tours, said Beth Whitman, CEO of Seattle-based WanderTours, \u201cbut it\u2019s become more acceptable for women to leave their families, partners or spouses behind and travel with a group of like-minded women.\u201d Her company tends to attract retirees with plenty of discretionary funds to drop on four- or five-star experiences, she added.",
      "Doni Belau, founder of the women-only travel company Girls\u2019 Guide to the World, said that until recently, industry marketers have overlooked the \u201csignificant financial resources\u201d many women command \u2014 and their eagerness to put them toward solo excursions. About 85% of the women who join her trips are traveling alone and \u201cwilling and able to spend money to create great life experiences for themselves,\u201d she said.",
      "Women have long faced a distinct set of challenges traveling independently in many parts of the world, with potential pitfalls ranging from minor inconveniences to physical danger. Many businesses chasing more solo female travelers are looking to head off some of these concerns.",
      "Carin Smith, a 61-year-old journalist from Cape Town, South Africa, recalled being declined a waterfront seat at a restaurant in Venice even though plenty were empty.",
      "\u201cI was told \u2018off the record\u2019 that they make more money from couples and families than from a female solo traveler,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how much protested I couldn\u2019t get a prime table because I was on my own.\u201d",
      "Heather Heverling, president and managing director for North America at the U.K.-based custom tour operator Audley Travel, said companies like hers try to plan around these hiccups.",
      "\u201cIf a\u00a0solo\u00a0traveler\u00a0wants to meet other people on their trip, our specialists will suggest a property that organizes shared dining,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can also recommend properties that don\u2019t charge a\u00a0single\u00a0supplement,\u201d she said, referring to the dreaded premium some hospitality operators impose on solo guests for occupying accommodations meant for two.",
      "M. Terry Bowman, an occupational therapy manager in Seattle who is 61, started traveling alone in her mid-30s. In the past, she\u2019d sleep on someone\u2019s floor or couch to save money, but she now budgets more for lodging and creature comforts. She also prioritizes destinations that \u201cwelcome and honor women. In an ever-changing world, I need to feel safe,\u201d she said.",
      "G Adventures, a touring company based in Toronto, recently launched \u201csolo-ish\u201d trips that combine independent and group experiences. About 64% of its clientele is female, and 35% are traveling alone.",
      "The company\u2019s target demographic is women who want to explore but may not have \u201ca similarly minded travel partner, or timing didn\u2019t align, and were hesitant to travel on their own,\u201d said U.S. communications manager Kimberly Greiner.",
      "Many women are wary of \u201ccertain places where maybe there was a language barrier or \u2018unsafe for solo females\u2019 reputation,\u201d she said. To address some of these issues, the company employs female guides and carefully vets activities like homestays and meals with locals.",
      "Cruise lines have been easing obstacles to solo travelers regardless of age or gender \u2014 while also chasing older and female passengers in particular.",
      "A number of major operators \u201care building out some really nice options for those traveling by themselves,\u201d said Colleen McDaniel, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic. She cited Norwegian\u00a0Cruise\u00a0Line, which added about 1,000 solo staterooms to its 19-ship fleet in 2024, along with activities and a lounge just for solo guests.",
      "Other cruise\u00a0lines are also adding solo cabins and offering more ways to avoid or save on single supplement fees. AmaWaterways, for example,\u00a0removed that charge on select European river cruises in 2024 and waives it on some ships in Europe. The Swiss travel network\u00a0A Small World,\u00a0meanwhile, launched the Solo Cruise Company in May 2024 targeting women 55 and up.",
      "Uniworld River Cruises said it has seen a 31% increase in solo guests between 2019 and 2023 and a 61% jump in female solo travelers over the same period. It\u2019s offering its first women-only river cruise in August 2025."

    "title": "He\u2019s one of college football\u2019s winningest coaches \u2014 yet his own team\u2019s fans aren\u2019t sold on him",
    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 10:01:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Ryan Day is one of college football\u2019s winningest coaches, but he's feeling pressure from Ohio State fans for a 1-4 record vs. Michigan.",
    "story": [
      "For as long as there have been coaches, there has been consternation over their performance.",
      "Yet even in that generations-old tradition, the case of Ohio State\u2019s Ryan Day is unique. Few coaches have produced as much ostensible success \u2014 and angst.",
      "In his six seasons in Columbus, Day\u2019s Ohio State teams have made four playoff appearances and won two Big Ten conference titles \u2014 making him the first coach since the program began in 1890 to start his career with consecutive conference titles. Under Day, the Buckeyes are 39-3 at home, 46-5 against conference opponents and 21-9 against ranked teams.",
      "When the Buckeyes arrive at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, for Wednesday\u2019s College Football Playoff quarterfinal matchup against top-seeded Oregon, Day will boast a record of 67-10 and a winning percentage of .870, which, if it qualified (he hasn\u2019t yet coached 10 seasons), would rank second on college football\u2019s all-time coaching leader board.",
      "A start like that might lead some coaches to be lionized or to earn enough goodwill to ensure decades of job security. Not in Columbus, where over the past month local coverage has described the \u201cDay dilemma\u201d and national outlets have pondered \u201cHow hot is Ryan Day\u2019s Seat at Ohio State?\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uncomfortable, and they don\u2019t like him right now, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d said Ari Wasserman, a national college football reporter for On3, who previously covered Ohio State for a decade as a beat reporter.",
      "Unlike his two predecessors who won national championships in their first three seasons, Day has yet to claim a national title. In Columbus, however, perhaps even more damning is that Ohio State has also struggled in the other main criterion by which its football coaches are evaluated: It can\u2019t beat its biggest rival.",
      "Under Day, Ohio State is 1-4 against archrival Michigan, including four consecutive losses, and while fans could rationalize that rivalry losses in 2021, 2022 and 2023 were against strong Michigan teams \u2014 the most recent of which went on to win the national championship \u2014 the Buckeyes\u2019 Nov. 30 defeat was mostly baffling.",
      "Unranked, playing on the road and 20.5-point underdogs, the Wolverines commanded the game en route to a stunning win. As a postgame skirmish broke out on the field, cameras caught Day looking on, unmoving, as if in a daze. On social media, commenters were quick to point out that Ohio State had fallen flat despite having assembled a roster that, the school\u2019s new athletic director said last summer, had cost $20 million in name, image and likeness payments.",
      "One month later, even after Ohio State routed Tennessee in a first-round playoff game on Dec. 21, \u201cOSU fans are still in a bit of shock about the Buckeyes playing such a bad game against a substandard Michigan team,\u201d Doug Lesmerises, host of \u201cKings of the North,\u201d a college football YouTube show, wrote by email.",
      "Lesmerises, who has covered Ohio State since 2005, wrote that though the first-round victory had reinvigorated some national title confidence, it also \u201calmost makes the Michigan loss more perplexing.\u201d",
      "\u201cDay won\u2019t just shake that off. A lot of fans who had been behind him have real, first-time questions about him that won\u2019t be forgotten.\u201d",

      "Jayden Daniels' latest comeback heroics earn Commanders a playoff berth",
      "Facing a barrage of criticism of a coach he didn\u2019t hire, Ohio State\u2019s athletic director offered public support for Day in mid-December, telling a local radio station that Day will \u201cabsolutely\u201d be back next season. It is an open question, however, how much support Day has elsewhere within a fan base that dreams of national titles but demands a winning record against its rival.",
      "\u201cOhio State has three goals each year \u2014 beat Michigan, win the Big Ten, win a national title. They are 0-11 on goals the last four years and still chasing this national title,\u201d Lesmerises wrote. \u201cIf Ohio State doesn\u2019t compete well against Oregon, and as long as OSU alum and former successful NFL head coach Mike Vrabel is without a current job, I don\u2019t think Day\u2019s future is certain.\u201d",
      "Like Jim Tressel and Urban Meyer, who each coached the school to a national title since 2002, Vrabel comes from deep Ohio roots. Day, in contrast, grew up in New Hampshire and spent virtually his entire career in either the Northeast or the NFL until he was hired as Ohio State\u2019s offensive coordinator in 2017. Geography might matter little at some schools; for the Buckeyes, however, it is paramount. Ohio State players, coaches and fans rarely refer to Michigan by name, described it instead as \u201cThat Team Up North\u201d or simply the initials \u201cTTUN.\u201d Each fall, as \u201cThe Game\u201d approaches on the final weekend in November, it has become an annual Columbus tradition to cross out the letter \u201cM\u201d on campus signs with red Xes.",
      "\u201cThe prevailing question about Ohio State\u2019s coach is always can you be successful here if you do everything right and can\u2019t beat that team,\u201d Wasserman said.",
      "Technically, the answer is now yes.",
      "For more than 100 years, the path to a national title in college football effectively required an undefeated or one-loss season, making the Ohio State-Michigan rivalry, played on the final weekend in November, a de facto elimination game in some years. This season\u2019s expansion of the College Football Playoff from four teams to 12 and Ohio State\u2019s place in the Big Ten, one of the sport\u2019s two most powerful conferences, have afforded more leeway for losses and uncoupled the stakes of beating Michigan from the larger pursuit of a national title.",
      "So despite an October loss to Oregon and the November head-scratcher against Michigan, the Buckeyes\u2019 title dreams remain intact. That doesn\u2019t mean the quarterfinal appearance in the Rose Bowl has healed all wounds. In a forum on Eleven Warriors, a popular Buckeyes fan website, a commenter recently polled fellow fans about what constituted success this season. One poster responded: \u201cHow can we have a poll about possible season-ending options when the season has already ended?\u201d",
      "\u201cWinning a national championship is obviously the biggest prize, and I think people will be happy and celebrate it, but I think that in their hearts that there will be something missing from that illustrious season,\u201d Wasserman said. \u201cWhen teams look back at their champions and celebrate them, they think about purity. It\u2019s not a pure season here.",
      "\u201cThe main aspect of being a fan is to be able to talk trash to people and talk trash to Michigan fans. It\u2019s like you win a national championship, you can buy all the memorabilia and the shirts and the commemorative graphics and all that stuff. But at the end of the day, a Michigan fan can look you in the eye and say, \u2018We beat you.\u2019 That sucks.\u201d",
      "In a twist, perhaps the most apt source of optimism for Day and Ohio State fans is the example of none other than Michigan. After he arrived in 2015, Wolverines coach Jim Harbaugh promptly lost five consecutive times to Ohio State and, like Day, saw his goodwill fray. Yet last January Harbaugh rode the streets of Ann Arbor basking in a national championship parade.",
      "For Day, \u201ca national title parade would fix things,\u201d Lesmerises wrote. \u201cUntil the last Saturday in November in 2025.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A U.S. military court on Monday upheld a judge\u2019s ruling that said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin acted improperly this year when he invalidated plea agreements for three men accused of planning the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.",
      "The Court of Military Commission Review heard an appeal that sought to preserve Austin's move in August to unravel the plea deals with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin \u2018Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi. The agreements allow the defendants to plead guilty to lesser charges that would prevent them from receiving the death penalty.",
      "The three-judge panel concluded that Austin did not have the authority to back out of deals implemented by Susan Escallier, the convening authority for military commissions appointed by the defense secretary last year who worked to negotiate the agreements.",
      "The court said the defense secretary improperly rescinded the deals after the pretrial agreements were already underway.",
      "Chief Judge Lisa M. Schenck wrote in her opinion, with the two other judges concurring, that Austin\u2019s intervention in existing pretrial agreements was \u201cwithout precedent.\u201d",

      "The ruling affirms a lower court's finding last month that the three defendants should be allowed to move forward with their plea deals. All three stand accused of aiding, abetting and conspiring to carry out the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and other sites.",
      "The ruling noted that lawyers informed the court of the plea deals Aug. 1. The next day, Austin withdrew Escallier's authority to make such an agreement.",
      "\"Responsibility for such a decision should rest with me,\" Austin said at the time.",
      "The court said that it would be unjust and outside the bounds of his authority for Austin to dismantle such a deal retroactively. It said the existence of a convening authority who can negotiate plea deals \u2014 in this case, Escallier \u2014 and a boss who can unravel them is not supported under military justice."

    "title": "Sanctions brought on by Putin's war in Ukraine are taking a bite out of Russia's mayo-based New Year's salad",
    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 15:01:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Sanctions introduced after Vladimir Putin launched his war in Ukraine are affecting the price of Russia's traditional new year dish, the Olivier Salad.",
    "story": [
      "MOSCOW \u2014 It\u2019s akin to Turkey at Thanksgiving: On New Year\u2019s in Russia, revelers traditionally consume lashings of Olivier salad.",
      "It was introduced to the then-Russian Empire in 1860 by French chef Lucien Olivier, but these days everyone has a slightly different recipe. It\u2019s so popular that the cost of its staple ingredients \u2014 which usually include sausage, potatoes and dollops of mayonnaise \u2014 have their own price index that\u2019s tracked by the media.",
      "With soaring inflation and the ruble dropping to one of its lowest levels against the dollar since President Vladimir Putin launched his war in Ukraine, this year Russians will have to pay more for the dish, which is traditionally served alongside caviar and tangerines, before the New Year is toasted in.",
      "Along with rising food prices, a weaker ruble following the latest round of American sanctions in November has fueled inflation and driven up the cost of imports into Russia. A huge increase in military spending has also led to labor, supply and production shortages. And while workers from every industry have volunteered or been called up to serve in Ukraine, farming has been among the worst affected.",
      "The so-called Olivier Index, which monitors how much it costs to make one of the salads for four people, is up 16% year over year, to 414 rubles from 348, according to Rosstat, Russia\u2019s federal statistics agency. (That\u2019s equivalent to a jump to $3.94 from $3.31.)",
      "And prices have shot up for other groceries such as eggs (up 45% since January) and butter (up almost 40%), according to data released this month by Rosstat. Potatoes, meanwhile, cost almost twice as much as they did a year ago. Between November and December alone, they rose 10% from 99.99 rubles to 109.99, according to an NBC News analysis. While not a staple food, caviar has shot up to almost 9,000 rubles per kilo from 6,000 in December 2023, Rosstat found.",
      "So ordinary people, for whom the average salary is around $830 a month, are feeling the pinch.",
      "\u201cEverything\u2019s getting more expensive \u2014 bread, meat, vegetables, fruit,\u201d Svetlana Govorukhina told NBC News in a telephone interview earlier this month.",
      "\u201cI can see everything is getting more expensive but as I can still afford all I need,\u201d added Govorukhina, a 69-year-old music teacher from Kaluga, a city around 125 miles south of Moscow.",
      "\u201cI can support myself even in the current situation. But as long as I cannot do anything about the economic situation, I prefer not to waste my emotions on it,\u201d she added.",
      "But that puts her in the minority, as rising prices become the most pressing concern for Russians in most regions, according to a study published Dec. 27 by CROS, a Moscow-based marketing and communications agency. Prices replaced the war in Ukraine as the main concern for the first time since February 2022, when Putin ordered the invasion of his neighbor, according to the findings, which are based on analysis of social media trends and reports in traditional news media.",
      "\u201cThe rise in prices is particularly painful for the poorest, but the middle class \u2014 accustomed to higher levels of consumption and frequently purchasing imported goods \u2014 may feel the impact more acutely,\u201d Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin based nongovernmental organization, said earlier this month.",
      "And that was certainly the case for Moscow-based university worker Anna, 37, who said the cost of \u201cbaby foods, diapers and so on grew colossally,\u201d as sanctions started to bite shortly after Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine and her son turned 1.",
      "Prices \u201cbounced back a bit later, but since then everything has rather been getting more and more expensive,\u201d she said.",
      "Anna did not want her last name or the name of her husband to be published out of fear of retribution against her family. Putin\u2019s war next door has brought a far-reaching crackdown on dissent at home, and anything that can be perceived as an anti-war stance could result in arrest or even jail time.",
      "She added that meat and fruit prices had also risen, but she was still prepared to splurge.",
      "\u201cWhen I see the final sum at the checkout, I start worrying as it used to be significantly smaller for the same list,\u201d Anna said. \u201cBut I still buy the same, I am not cutting back on anything.\u201d",
      "She added that she was going to make Olivier salad for New Year's but would use potatoes grown by her mother-in-law, who like many Russians is mindful of previous economic hardship and keeps her own vegetable garden.",
      "\u201cAs for the sparkling wine, we will go with Italian. We are ready to pay more for it,\u201d Anna said.",
      "Her husband\u2019s \u201cmajor complaint is that there is no good beer anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just does not like Russian beer brands.\u201d",
      "An overheating economy?",
      "Addressing the economy at his annual end-of-year news conference earlier this month, Putin said that inflation was a problem and that  the country\u2019s economy was \u201coverheating.\u201d In part, he blamed international sanctions for price rises, \u201cbecause they make logistics more expensive,\u201d but he also appeared to criticize Russia\u2019s central bank for failing to tame inflation.",
      "In an apparent response, the bank did not raise its interest rate to 23% the following day, a move that had been widely expected.",
      "While the social and financial difficulties have yet to translate into significant political dissent \u201ceven with substantial repression,\u201d avoiding large-scale anger over economic issues \u201cmatters to the authorities and it appears to matter to Putin,\u201d Alex Brideau, of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political risk consultancy, said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "He added that Putin had \u201cbeen able to shift the blame for high prices away from himself and onto the government or businesses in the past and will probably do that again.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said, the rising prices would \u201cput a lot of pressure on the government to show that it is handling the situation with minimal disruption to the public\u2019s holiday festivities.",
      "Back in Russia, music teacher Govorukhina was determined to make the best of the New Year celebrations.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t eat a lot when we were younger, and now as we have gotten older we need even less. I can afford caviar, but not crab meat, though it is now hard to find a good one,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI have friends who complain, but I am not like that. Your lifestyle is more important than money. I love music and going to concerts, I love my job \u2014 this helps to somewhat cushion these blows. We have never had a rich life.\u201d",
      "Lena Medvedeva reported from Moscow. Karen Glichrist and Henry Austin from London."

    "summary": "A South Korean court issued warrants to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol and search his office and residence over allegations of rebellion in connection with his short-lived declaration of martial law.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A South Korean court issued warrants Tuesday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol and search his office and residence over allegations of rebellion in connection with his short-lived declaration of martial law.",
      "It\u2019s the first time a warrant has been issued to detain a sitting South Korean president. But experts say there is little chance of detention or searches unless Yoon is formally removed from office.",
      "The Seoul Western District Court issued warrants to detain Yoon and to search the presidential office and residence in central Seoul, according to a statement from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military authorities.",
      "The agency says it\u2019s been investigating whether Yoon\u2019s Dec. 3 declaration amounted to rebellion.",
      "Under South Korean law, the leader of a rebellion can face the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "Yoon\u2019s powers have been suspended since the opposition-controlled National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, during which hundreds of troops and police officers were deployed at the assembly. By law, a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament\u2019s operations even under martial law.",
      "Yoon has argued his decree was a legitimate act of governance, calling it a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party \u2014 which he has called \u201ca monster\u201d and \u201canti-state forces\u201d \u2014 that has used its legislative majority to impeach top officials, undermine the government\u2019s budget, and which he claims sympathizes with North Korea.",
      "The Constitutional Court is to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him.",
      "Experts said Yoon is likely to ignore the warrants.",
      "Yoon Kap-keun, a lawyer for the president, called the detainment warrant \u201cinvalid\u201d and \u201cillegal,\u201d saying the anti-corruption agency lacks legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. The presidential security service said it will provide security to Yoon in accordance with the law.",
      "The anti-corruption agency said it has no immediate plans on when it would proceed with the warrants.",
      "\u201cUnless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,\u201d said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. \u201cShould investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?\u201d",
      "Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon\u2019s residence to show they are strictly and fairly carrying out their work.",
      "Park Sung-min, president of Seoul-based political consulting firm MIN Consulting, said the push for an arrest warrant is likely an attempt to pressure Yoon to cooperate with investigations.",
      "Former President Park Geun-hye, who was thrown out of office in 2017 following an impeachment over a corruption scandal, also refused to meet with prosecutors while in office. She underwent questioning by them and was arrested after the Constitutional Court removed her from office.",
      "Yoon\u2019s imposition of martial law lasted only six hours but triggered huge political turmoil, halting high-level diplomacy and rattling financial markets. Despite Yoon\u2019s deployment of troops and police, enough lawmakers managed to enter the assembly chamber to overturn it unanimously.",
      "Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the martial law enactment.",
      "Yoon has claimed he wasn\u2019t trying to stop the functioning of the assembly, saying that the troops were sent to maintain order, and also denied planning to arrest politicians. But comments by now-arrested commanders of military units sent to the assembly have contradicted this claim.",
      "Kwak Jong-keun, the commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, testified at the National Assembly that Yoon called on troops to \u201cquickly knock down the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.\u201d Kwak said he did not carry out Yoon\u2019s orders.",
      "The country\u2019s political crisis deepened last Friday, when the Democratic Party and other small opposition parties voted to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo as well over wrangling over his refusal to fill in three justice seats at the nine-member Constitutional Court. Observers say adding more justices could increase prospects for the court\u2019s endorsement of Yoon\u2019s impeachment as that requires support from at least six justices.",
      "The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, has become South Korea\u2019s new interim leader. On Tuesday, Choi appointed two new justices, saying he feels the urgency to resolve political uncertainty and national divide."

    "story": [
      "A woman will lead the Central Bank of Syria for the first time in the institution's 70-year history after the country\u2019s new leadership appointed Maysaa Sabrine, a former deputy governor of the bank, to helm it.",
      "In leading the institution that manages the country's currency and sets its monetary policy, she will be in a prime position to help heal an economy shattered by 13 years of war and stringent international sanctions. Today, about 70% of Syria's population lives in poverty, and another 30% in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank.",
      "Sabrine, whose appointment was reported by Reuters, is expected to replace Mohammed Issam Hazime, who had been named governor in 2021 by since-ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad.",
      "She now faces the task of leading the bank through a dire financial landscape, with Syria\u2019s economy having deteriorated significantly in the years since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011.",
      "Her rise to the top role comes as Syria's new de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa and his Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham\u00a0group, which led rebel forces in the Assad regime's ouster, seek to project a more moderate image, promising an inclusive society in which the country's myriad religious and ethnic groups, as well as women, will be represented.",
      "In a recent interview with the BBC, Sharaa sought to contrast his vision for a future Syria against the leadership of the Taliban in Afghanistan, where women have faced extreme restrictions that bar them from public spaces, as well as from seeking higher education.",
      "Pointing to HTS' record in Idlib in Syria's northwest, where the rebel group has governed for years, he noted that he believed in educational access for women.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had universities in Idlib for more than eight years,\u201d Sharaa said, adding: \u201cI think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%.\u201d",
      "Sabrine had already held a number of prominent roles within Syria's central bank, including first deputy governor and supervising director, according to the Saudi state-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya.",
      "In addition, Sabrine, who holds a master\u2019s degree in accounting, has also served as a member of the Damascus Securities Exchange Board of Directors since 2018, representing the Central Bank, according to the broadcaster.",
      "In the days since Assad's ouster, the Central Bank has sought to liberalize Syria's economy, which was previously heavily controlled by his regime.",
      "Sharaa has called on Western countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to lift the crippling sanctions that targeted the Assad regime.",
      "The U.S. earlier this month removed a $10 million bounty that was placed on Sharaa himself after meetings between U.S. diplomats and the HTS leadership. But HTS itself remains on Washington's terrorist list.",
      "While the weeks since Assad's ouster Dec. 8 have remained relatively stable in Syria, Sharaa said over the weekend in an interview with Al Arabiya that it could take up to four years for new elections to be held.",
      "And fears have grown that the delicate and relative peace that has washed over Syria in the days since Assad's overthrow could be easily disrupted. Protests by members of the Alawite community, the minority sect the Assad family belongs to, erupted last week in Homs after video showing an Alawite shrine in Aleppo being vandalized circulated online.",
      "The demonstrations prompted the country's revamped security forces to institute new security measures in Homs, the country's third-largest city, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters also took to the streets in Christian neighborhoods of Damascus last week after a Christmas tree burning deepened fears that new leadership would still oversee a crackdown on religious minorities in the country.",
      "But in Homs, which has a diverse population of Sunni and Shia Muslims, as well as Christians and Alawites, a relatively peaceful Christmas in the Christian suburb of Fayrouzeh appeared to help assuage some fears.",
      "\u201cWe had a very beautiful holiday even though there was some anxiety before it,\u201d one Fayrouzeh resident, Sarab Kashi, told the AP. \u201cThe guys from HTS volunteered and stood as guards on the door of the churches.\u201d",
      "But whether Syria\u2019s new leadership will be able to maintain that relative calm remains to be seen, with the international community keeping a close eye on the shifting circumstances in Damascus."

If his mindset is, let\u2019s rest and get ready for this run, I\u2019m all for that, too ... I came here to do something special. Breaking a record is special, but I want a banner up there.

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 04:29:25 GMT",
    "summary": "The FBI is warning sports leagues that star athletes who display valuables on social media are vulnerable to burglars familiar with their often-public travel schedules.",
    "story": [
      "The FBI is warning sports leagues that star athletes who display valuables on social media are vulnerable to burglars familiar with their often-public travel schedules.",
      "The bureau recently issued the best-practices memo as part of a long-standing practice of communicating with private businesses about crime trends, a U.S. official briefed on the matter said.",
      "The memo, a \"liaison information report,\" urges the leagues to advise athletes to limit imagery of valuables, such as cash, jewels and electronics, on their public accounts, the official said.",
      "Star athletes and their loved ones who have become victims of burglaries this year include Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis Jr., Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107\u00a0and the fianc\u00e9e of Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott.",
      "The FBI said the burglaries described in the memo are most likely driven by South American organized theft groups that conduct surveillance, review security measures and target pro athletes believed to have high-value belongings and cash, the source said.",
      "Scott Andrew Selby, author of \u201cFlawless: Inside the Largest Diamond Heist in History,\u201d said: \u201cPro athletes are being targeted because they have money, and you can easily tell from social media if they have things that you can easily steal, like watches or jewelry. And everyone knows when they are away at work.\"",
      "One of the most recent victims was Don\u010di\u0107, whose home was breached Friday night when he was in Phoenix for his team\u2019s 98-89 win against the Suns, his manager said, according to\u00a0NBC Dallas-Fort Worth.",
      "Burrow's home was burglarized when he and his teammates were in Arlington, Texas, for a game against the Cowboys.",
      "The break-in at Kelce's home in Leawood, Kansas \u2014 in which thieves took $20,000, according to police records reviewed by NBC affiliate KSHB of Kansas City, Missouri \u2014 was reported Oct. 8, the day after the Chiefs beat the New Orleans Saints in a \"Monday Night Football\" game.",
      "The FBI memo includes advice to athletes that is consistent with recent guidance to the leagues' athletes, including keeping boastful images of expensive belongings off social media, the source said.",
      "An FBI spokesperson would not confirm the existence of the memo, first reported by ABC News, saying by email: \"While we cannot confirm or deny the existence of any specific investigations, the FBI monitors potential threats and regularly shares information with our law enforcement partners and the private sector to help protect public safety.",
      "\"As always,\" the spokesperson added, \"we ask members of the public to report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement.\"",
      "Authorities have alleged South American crews are involved in a rash of burglaries targeting high-wealth estates from Southern California to Dallas to the Midwest in recent years.",
      "On Monday, police in Chile said they recovered a watch belonging to actor Keanu Reeves that was part of a haul of valuables seized in connection with a person who was detained on suspicion of robbery and violence in Santiago.",
      "Police said the watch was part of a case in Los Angeles late last year in which some of Reeves' belongings were stolen. Los Angeles police said Monday their investigation of the theft is ongoing.",
      "Authorities have not said the Reeves case is linked to burglaries of star athletes' homes, but there are clear similarities to a wave of break-ins targeting the rich and sometimes famous in Southern California dating back more than a decade.",
      "Los Angeles police, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, the Orange County District Attorney's Office, the San Diego County District Attorney's Office and the FBI have been investigating and helping to prosecute burglars believed to be part of criminal groups from South America for several years.",
      "In summer, a trio of defendants from Chile and Italy were sentenced to four years in one case and six in the others for conspiring to commit burglary in January, when they broke into a home in Carlsbad, a city on the northern coast of San Diego County.",
      "Prosecutors said the defendants used a popular visa waiver to come to the country as tourists or businesspeople.",
      "The case was \"part of a crime spree that has plagued our nation where organized criminal rings, often with criminal records in their own country, are given a visa to the United States that they use to commit burglary tourism,\" San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan said in a statement in July.",
      "To the north, Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has long decried Chileans' eligibility for visa waivers that allow them to come to the United States with the little scrutiny. Criminals from Chile and other South American nations travel here, he said, through the Visa Waiver Program, which is offered to 42 nations in exchange for similar ease-of-travel measures for Americans.",
      "The waiver can be granted through the automated Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). Those who get the waiver can stay in the United States for 90 days.",
      "\u201cFor the last 18 months, I have been sounding the alarm about a dangerous loophole in the ESTA Visa Waiver program that is being exploited by organized crime rings from Chile to enter the United States unlimited times over a two-year period without background checks,\" Spitzer said.",
      "Spitzer said thousands of Chileans have traveled on the waiver without much scrutiny, creating a \"loophole\" for burglars to access the mansions of U.S. pro athletes and others with some ease.",
      "\"These criminals aren\u2019t coming to the United States to visit Disneyland and other tourist destinations \u2014 they are coming here to steal, terrorizing Americans in their own homes,\" Spitzer said by email Monday.",
      "Spitzer would like to see Chileans removed from waiver eligibility.",
      "The State Department, which administers visas, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.",
      "LAPD Chief of Detectives Alan Hamilton described at least some of the burglary suspects accused of targeting high-dollar residences as belonging to transnational gangs who favor the kind of communities where star athletes and actors happen to be found.",
      "The burglaries, he said, have spread far and wide. Investigations that started in Southern California, Hamilton said, \u201chave resulted in suspects being tracked in virtually every state across the country.\u201d"

      "Norovirus, sometimes called the \u201cwinter vomiting disease\u201d or \u201ctwo-bucket disease\u201d \u2014 because it causes both vomiting and diarrhea \u2014 is on the rise across the nation, even as seasonal flu is taking off and walking pneumonia rages on.",
      "Wastewater data and reports from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention have shown a significant spike in norovirus in the last few weeks, with rates far exceeding those of the past few years.",
      "At least 91 outbreaks were reported the week of Dec. 5, more than double the maximum number of outbreaks reported in the same time frame over the last several years.",
      "What is norovirus and how can you stay protected?",
      "What is norovirus?",
      "Noroviruses have been called \u201cthe perfect human pathogens.\u201d They\u2019re a type of highly contagious stomach bug that causes severe vomiting and diarrhea, along with headache, fever and body aches. It spreads fast and far on surfaces and through the air in tiny droplets of vomit.\u00a0Most people fully recover, but only after days of misery. Because it mutates, people can get sick with a norovirus every year.",
      "Outbreaks can occur at any time, but are most common from November to April.",
      "The virus travels in vomit and diarrhea. It spreads by direct contact with someone who has norovirus, or by touching contaminated surfaces and then putting your fingers in your mouth. Contaminated food or liquids can also spread the virus.",
      "Shellfish, especially oysters and clams, are also known to spread the bug, because they are filter feeders and can accumulate the virus from untreated sewage flowing into their habitats.",
      "What are norovirus symptoms? How long do they last?",
      "Symptoms begin 12 to 48 hours after exposure to the virus and last for about 1 to 3 days. Even after recovering, infected individuals can be contagious for two more weeks.",
      "One of the dangers of prolific vomiting and diarrhea is the loss of fluids, which can lead to severe dehydration. This is something to watch out for in children and the elderly in particular \u2014 children may not produce tears when crying, or be unusually fussy or sleepy, if they are dehydrated.",
      "There is no specific medicine that is used to treat the disease. Instead, symptoms can be managed with oral rehydration solutions like Pedialyte, which can help restore fluids and electrolytes that are lost from the body.",
      "Why is norovirus so hard to kill?",
      "The most reliable way to stop the spread is washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially if you are preparing food, or after using the restroom or changing diapers.",
      "Hand sanitizer is not very effective against norovirus. While many viruses are contained in \u201cenvelopes\u201d that are made of fat and can be broken by alcohol-based sanitizers, norovirus is contained in a hardy protein shell called a capsid. It's not as easily wiped out by alcohol disinfectants.",
      "Cruises, which had a banner year in 2024, are often associated with norovirus, due to the close quarters and shared facilities, but the virus is not restricted to cruise ships. Nursing homes, hospitals, jails, and preschools can all be sites of an outbreak.",
      "Avoiding raw or undercooked shellfish can also reduce the risk of infection. Since norovirus can survive temperatures up to 145\u00b0F, quick steaming will not kill the virus.",
      "Even if you have had norovirus before, you can still be infected every year, because there are many different types of the bug, owing to the rapid mutation rate seen in RNA viruses like norovirus.",
      "Norovirus is notoriously difficult to clean because it can stay on surfaces for weeks to months. It is important to wear gloves and use bleach when disinfecting a contaminated surface, such as one that has been in contact with vomit or diarrhea. Bleach should be left on the area for at least five minutes.",
      "Use disposable paper towels, rather than reusable rags, when cleaning a contaminated surface.",
      "Clothes or bedding used by someone with norovirus should be handled with gloves and washed with detergent and hot water for as long as possible at the highest heat setting.",
      "There\u2019s currently no approved vaccine for norovirus, although Moderna has begun a phase three trial in the U.S. for a vaccine using mRNA technology and aims to test it in 25,000 adults worldwide. Norovirus causes about 200,000 deaths worldwide each year."

    "story": [
      "The Netflix docuseries \"American Nightmare\" focused on the harrowing kidnapping of Denise Huskins, during which she was abducted from her California residence in front of her boyfriend Aaron Quinn in 2015 and held for two days before she was released.",
      "Authorities later arrested Matthew Muller on robbery and assault charges in 2015, suspecting him to be behind the abduction plot. Muller, a 2006 graduate of Harvard University and a U.S. Marine from 1995 to 1999, was once a practicing immigration attorney in San Francisco, according to an FBI arrest warrant obtained by NBC Bay Area. Muller, 47, has since been disbarred, according to the California State Bar.",
      "On Monday, Dec. 30, the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office announced in a news release that Muller has been charged in two 2009 home invasion sexual assault cases that occurred in Mountain View and Palo Alto, California. The district attorney's office said in a statement that \"advances in forensic DNA testing\" helped the attorney's office connect Muller to the crimes. Muller, who is currently in prison, is now being charged with two felony counts.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Muller\u2018s crimes and where he is serving his 40-year prison sentence for kidnapping Huskins.",
      "How did Matthew Muller kidnap Denise Huskins?",
      "Muller broke into Huskins and Quinn\u2019s home on Mare Island in Vallejo, California, between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. on March 23, 2015, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of California.",
      "He used a stun gun and a simulated gun with a laser attached to order the victims to the ground, where he bound and blindfolded them with blackened swim goggles, before forcing them to drink sedative, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Muller also played a prerecorded message indicating that not following the commands would lead to physical punishment or electric shock.",
      "He then put Huskins into the trunk of his vehicle, which he drove to his residence in South Lake Tahoe, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Huskins said Muller forced her to have sex with him twice, which he videotaped, while she was held in captivity at the cabin.",
      "During this time, he also sent two emails to Quinn, demanding a ransom of $17,000. Muller released Huskins in Huntington Beach on March 25, 2015, with no ransom ever being paid, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "While Huskins was missing, a Vallejo Police Department detective questioned Quinn for hours, at times suggesting Quinn was involved with Huskins\u2019 disappearance, according to video footage of the interrogation aired in \u201cAmerican Nightmare.\u201d",
      "The day Huskins was released, the department said in a statement investigators had found no evidence of a kidnapping and accused Huskins and Quinn of faking the abduction.",
      "\u201cThere is no evidence to support the claims that this was a stranger abduction or an abduction at all,\u201d Vallejo police said in the statement. \u201cGiven the facts that have been presented thus far, this event appears to be an orchestrated event and not a kidnapping.\u201d",
      "The Vallejo Police Department did not respond to a request for comment from TODAY.com.",
      "When was Matthew Muller arrested?",
      "Quinn and Huskins\u2019 case remained unsolved until the Dublin Police Services of the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Department arrested Muller on charges from a separate home invasion case on June 8, 2015, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "In the Dublin home invasion, a couple had been tied up while Muller attempted to abduct their daughter. Investigators found a cellphone they later traced to Muller, according to authorities.",
      "Dublin police searched Muller\u2018s South Lake Tahoe cabin and located evidence related to Huskins\u2019 abduction, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. The FBI then searched the cabin, two other residences, a vehicle and a storage locker.",
      "FBI analysis of Muller\u2018s computers found a \u201csound recording consistent with the instructions given to Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins,\u201d as well as video recordings of Muller sexually assaulting Huskins, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Muller pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping in September 2015 in Huskins and Quinn\u2019s case, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Muller in 2022 pleaded no contest to two counts of forcible rape in California in Huskins\u2019 case, according to the District Attorney\u2019s office. He also pleaded guilty to state charges of robbery of an inhabited dwelling, residential burglary and false imprisonment.\u2013",
      "When was Matthew Muller sentenced?",
      "U.S. District Judge Troy L. Nunley sentenced Muller to 40 years in prison for Huskins\u2019 kidnapping in 2017.",
      "\u201cThe sentence imposed today reflects the egregiousness of Muller\u2019s conduct in this case. Muller had advantages in life that most people only dream of, yet he used his considerable intelligence to plan and execute the physical assault and psychological torture of two innocent strangers,\u201d Nunley said during the sentencing hearing.",
      "\u201cIt is difficult to imagine the level of suffering that Muller inflicted on his victims,\u201d Nunley continued. \u201cThe sentence handed down today takes into account that suffering and strives to ensure that Muller will never again commit such crimes.\u201d",
      "Muller\u2018s defense attorney Thomas Johnson declined to comment to the Associated Press after the sentencing hearing, where he argued for a 30-year sentence, as his client had been diagnosed as manic and depressive and could be rehabilitated with proper treatment. (The 2015 FBI arrest affidavit stated Muller told authorities that he suffered from \u201cGulf War Illness\u201d and was bipolar.)",
      "In 2022, Muller was sentenced to 31 years in prison after he pleaded no contest to two counts of forcible rape and guilty to three other charges in Solano County Superior Court. His state sentence will be served concurrently with the federal sentence.",
      "Where is Matthew Muller now?",
      "Muller is serving his prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tucson, Arizona, according to the Bureau of Prisons. His release date is scheduled for July 8, 2049, per the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "He gave a jailhouse interview to NBC Bay Area in 2018. Muller said he was married and also said he was not guilty. He said he pleaded guilty to the federal kidnapping charge in 2015 because he felt sorry for the couple.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any excuse for the way the Vallejo Police Department handled it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I thought it was worth it to take a dive and made sure they achieved justice for that wrongful accusation.\u201d",
      "He also said his guilty plea had to do with a \"severe depression\" he fell into while in the Sacramento jail. \"I didn\u2019t care what happened to me,\u201d he said.",
      "Now, Muller is also facing two felony counts for sexual assaults during two home invasions in 2009. He was arraigned on Monday, Dec. 30 and faces life in prison if convicted, the Santa Clara County District Attorney\u2019s Office confirmed in a statement.",
      "\"The details of this person\u2019s violent crime spree seem scripted for Hollywood, but they are tragically real,\" \u00a0District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a news release about Muller's latest charges. \"Our goal is to make sure this defendant is held accountable and will never hurt or terrorize anyone ever again. Our hope is that this nightmare is over.\"",

    "story": [
      "Several famous names and faces went public with their health diagnoses in 2024, with many urging people to get regular screenings and pay attention to their bodies.",
      "Some shared the first symptoms that signaled cancer or other medical concerns.",
      "Here are five of many celebrity health revelations shared this year:",
      "James Van Der Beek",
      "The former \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d star revealed he\u2019s been diagnosed with colorectal cancer.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s reason for optimism, and I\u2019m feeling good,\u201d the actor, 47, said in a statement in November.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in a good place and feeling strong.\u201d",
      "Van Der Beek\u2019s first symptoms were changes to his bowel movements, he told People.",
      "Such changes can include narrow stools or an unproductive urge to have a bowel movement, though the most common colorectal cancer warning sign is rectal bleeding, doctors say.",
      "The actor learned he had cancer after undergoing a colonoscopy and is receiving treatment, though he didn\u2019t specify the type. Colorectal cancer can be treated with medication, surgery and chemotherapy, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "Like many people, Van Der Beek thought colon cancer was an older person's disease, but it's now the leading cause of cancer death in men under 50, the American Cancer Society notes. This may be due to factors such as eating more processed foods, higher rates of alcohol consumption, obesity and more sedentary lifestyles.",
      "Jenna Fischer",

      "The diagnosis came after a routine mammogram showed \u201csomething in my left breast,\u201d she added. Since Fischer has dense breasts, which can make cancer harder to spot, doctors recommended a follow-up breast ultrasound, she told TODAY.",
      "The tumor was so small it couldn\u2019t be felt on a physical exam, so Fischer urged women to get their annual screening.",
      "\u201cIf I had waited six more months, it could have been much worse. It could have spread. It was a very aggressive form of cancer,\u201d Fischer said.",
      "She underwent a lumpectomy to remove the tumor in January and received 12 rounds of chemotherapy and three weeks of radiation. She continues to receive medication infusions.",
      "Jamie Foxx",
      "The Academy Award-winning actor finally explained what caused the illness that left him hospitalized and suffering from memory loss last year.",
      "It was \u201ca brain bleed that led to a stroke,\u201d Foxx, 56, said in his Netflix special, \u201cJamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was...\u201d \u2014 released on Dec. 10, 2024. He also revealed he came close to death.",

      "He was startled to find a golf-ball-sized lump in his groin \u2014 an enlarged lymph node that turned out to be a symptom of the cancer.",
      "Other warning signs include unexplained fever, night sweats and fatigue, according to the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\u201c(I was) feeling like I got punched in the stomach because it never happens to you. You always hear about it happening to someone else,\u201d Coulier, 65, told TODAY.",
      "He started chemotherapy and expects a \u201ctotal remission\u201d when he finishes treatment by February 2025.",
      "Coulier shared an emotional moment with TODAY\u2019s Al Roker, a prostate cancer survivor, when the two men hugged in Studio 1A.",
      "Christie Brinkley",
      "The model, who recently posed for Sports Illustrated at age 70, announced in March that she was diagnosed with skin cancer.",
      "The basal cell carcinoma on her temple was caught early and removed, she wrote on Instagram.",
      "This most common type of skin cancer grows slowly and often shows up as a non-healing spot that sometimes bleeds, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.",
      "It often develops on sun-exposed areas of the body such as the face, the American Cancer Society notes.",
      "Brinkley said she was \u201clucky\u201d a skin doctor spotted it while she accompanied one of her children to their appointment.",
      "\u201cAt the VERY end I asked if he could just look at a little tiny dot I could feel as I applied my foundation. He took a look and knew immediately it needed a biopsy! He did it then and there!\u201d she wrote.",
      "\u201cNow for this ole mermaid/gardener, I\u2019ll be slathering on my SPF 30, reapplying as needed, wearing long sleeves and a wide brim hat. And doing regular total body check ups.\u201d"

She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family,\" Jolie's attorney, James Simon of Hersh Mannis, said in a statement. \"This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\"",

      "\u201cI remember sitting there eight feet from him as he did it, and I remember thinking, \u2018Holy s---.\u2019 That could not have happened if there was an earwig in his ear,\" he added.",

      "Executive music producer Nick Baxter explained, speaking to the Gibson Gazette, a publication put out by the guitar manufacturer Gibson, how he worked with Chalamet to learn Dylan\u2019s guitar style. They went through the script and emphasized the \u201crawness,\u201d Baxter said.",
      "\u201cDylan\u2019s guitar playing is so unique; it\u2019s sort of messy and violent but also incredibly technically advanced, too. He\u2019s a great player. When you hear some of these early recordings, you can tell he\u2019d been playing guitar all the time, for many years. The technique is there, the playing is there, but there\u2019s a rawness to it. If you don\u2019t capture that, it sounds wrong immediately,\u201d he said.",

      "Netflix's hit show \"Squid Game\" released its highly anticipated second season on Dec. 26, which consisted of seven episodes.",
      "The second season flashes forward a few years after Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), a.k.a. Player 456, won the games. The trauma of everyone's death from Season 1 still weighs heavily on Gi-hun's conscience, causing him to devote himself and the $45.6 billion won (about $31 million dollars) he won to finding and ending the games once and for all.",
      "However, Gi-hun's plans go astray, causing him to be thrown back into the games once more with an entire new set of players.",
      "This time, the twist is that the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) who orchestrated all the games during Season 1 decided to enter the games himself, posing as Young-il, Player 001. The Front Man, whose real name is In-Ho, is a former winner of the games.",
      "Gi-hun, who once again plays as Player 456, makes his way through the games, beginning (like Season 1) with Red Light, Green Light, but adding in two new games afterwards: Pentathlon and Mingle.",
      "This season adds the twist that after each round, all players vote to decide if they want to continue the games or end them there.",
      "As the season progresses, Young-il (the Front Man in disguise) befriends Gi-hun, gaining his trust by explaining his own tragic backstory. He says his pregnant wife is dying and he joined the games to get the money to save her and his unborn child. However, viewers know the Front Man's wife already has died.",
      "This duo forms an alliance with other characters, including Gi-hun's best friend from Season 1 Park Jung-bae (Lee Seo-hwan) who is also a competitor this season and ex-marine Dae-ho (Kang Ha-neul).",
      "Season 2 also introduces new players like mother and son duo Park Yong-sik (Yang Dong-geun) and Jang Geum-ja (Kang Ae-sim), crypto currency influencer Lee Myung-gi (Yim Si-wan), pregnant player Kim Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri) and rapper Thanos (Choi Seung-hyun), amongst others.",
      "Outside of the games, Detective Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-jun), who Front Man seemingly shot and killed in the Season 1 finale, is actually alive. He's recovered and now independently searching for the island with the help of the boat captain who rescued him as the police don't believe his story about the games being real.",
      "How does the season end and where is the third, and what seems to be the final, season headed?",
      "Season 2's ending explained",

      "By the end of the season, Jun-ho has no luck finding the island and has yet to realize that the boat's captain is actually working to keep the games hidden.",
      "Within the games, the finale begins in the middle of a bloody fight between players. At this point, voting has split the remaining 100 players in half, with half wanting to stay and keep playing the games and half wanting to end the games. With a second vote scheduled for the next day, participants have resorted to killing other players who don't agree with their vote to strengthen their chances of the vote going their way.",
      "Gi-hun, meanwhile, has devised a plan to infiltrate the masked spectators' headquarters to put a stop to the games altogether and, in his words, \"make them pay.\"",
      "His convinces his friends to hide during the chaos instead of fighting to defend others on their side \u2014 which, as Young-il makes him say, shows he's willing to \"sacrifice a few for the good of the rest.\"",
      "While this is a new side to Gi-hun's character, whose goal has been to shed as little blood as possible, he decides a few more lives lost is worth it to end the games once and for all.",

      "The Front Man, still pretending to be the friendly Young-il, joins the riot and follows Gi-hun.",
      "The group is intercepted by gun fire before they can reach the game makers. Most of the final episode includes Gi-hun and his rebels fighting back against the pink-suited workers.",
      "Sadly, the rebellion fails, despite some moments of bravery from Hyun-ju who reveals she was in Special Forces before joining the games. They have too little ammo and end up being outnumbered.",
      "While Gi-hun and Jung-bae make it further than most of their crew, they ultimately end up failing when Young-il turns on them.",
      "Young-il splits up from Gi-hun, claiming he saw another way up to where the masked men are shooting down as Gi-hun and Jung-bae. However, when he goes that way, he ends up killing the two players he brought with him and sends a final radio message to Gi-hun pretending that he failed and died.",
      "He then dons the Front Man's classic outfit from Season 1, a long gray coat and black mask. As Gi-hun and Jung-bae surrender (clearly outnumbered), the Front Man slowly descends down the steps to them and, through a voice modulator, asks Gi-hun, \"Did you have fun playing the hero?\"",
      "\"Look closely at the consequences of your little hero game,\" he says as he turns his loaded gun towards Jung-bae, killing him instantly.",

      "\"That\u2019s how I wrote it,\" he told the outlet. \"But in the process, it came out to be too many episodes. So, I thought it\u2019d be better to divide it into two.\"",

      "Video captured outside Kamal Adwan Hospital and verified by NBC News shows its director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, wearing a white medical overcoat and walking alone toward a military vehicle. The street is strewn with rubble and the buildings around him appear destroyed, the video shared widely on social media shows.",
      "While it isn't clear exactly when the video was shot, the Israeli military confirmed Monday that it had detained and interrogated Abu Safiya. He was being held as a \"suspect\" and being questioned over \"potential involvement in terrorist activity,\" IDF spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said in a post on X.",

Separately, NBC News' crew on the ground in Gaza captured video of a blaze tearing through several units at the hospital on the same day. In it, people could be seen racing to try to douse the flames with buckets of water, while others sifted through the rubble.",
      "Shoshani previously said there was no connection between the fire and the IDF's activities at the site.",

      "\"If a hospital has been reduced to a bombed-out shell, it would cease to be protected, but otherwise a hospital, whether immediately used or not, is presumptively protected as an important civilian institution,\" Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch, previously told NBC News. \"It can be attacked only if actively used for military purposes, and even then, only if the civilian harm is not disproportionate.\"",

      "\"The operating and surgical departments, laboratory, maintenance, and emergency units have been completely burned, and the fire is now spreading to the buildings,\" the ministry's statement said.",
      "Ambulances have reportedly been dispatched to transfer the injured to the Indonesian Hospital as those inside continue to be removed.",
      "\"There are patients who are threatened with death at any moment due to the harsh conditions,\" the statement said.",
      "In response to a request by NBC News, the Israel Defense Forces said it had targeted the hospital after receiving information about \u201cthe presence of terrorist infrastructure and operatives carrying out terror activities\u201d inside.",
      "It added that \u201cIDF troops facilitated the secure evacuation of civilians, patients, and medical personnel prior to the operation\u201d and that it was continuing to \u201cmake extensive efforts to enable patients to continue receiving care in other hospitals.\u201d",
      "NBC News has reached out to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry for a response to the IDF\u2019s accusation that the hospital had been used for military purposes.",
      "Dr. Hussam Abu Safia, the hospital's head, said in an Instagram story that the Israeli army was \u201cburning all the operating departments in the hospital\u201d while medical staff was still present inside. He added that some of the staff had also been arrested.",
      "Shortly after, the Health Ministry issued a statement saying that the fate of the staff and patients had become \u201cunknown\u201d after \u201ccommunication with the hospital director was cut off.\u201d",
      "The attack and removals follow an Israeli airstrike that hit a building opposite the hospital Thursday, killing approximately 50 people, including five medical staff, according to the Health Ministry.",

      "In an October report, an independent commission for the United Nations accused Israel of perpetrating a \"concerted policy to destroy Gaza\u2019s healthcare system as part of a broader assault on Gaza, committing war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination with relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities.\"",
      "A press statement issued by the U.N. at the time of the report's release warned that Israel's targeting of healthcare facilities risks \"significant long-term detrimental effects on the civilian population.\""

      "\u201cWe woke up to find the girl like wood,\u201d Faseeh told NBC News.",
      "When doctors examined the baby, they found no health problems or congenital issues. Instead, they said, her heart had stopped beating because of the temperature plummeting during the night.",
      "She was born amid the war, Faseeh said, but she died because of the cold.",
      "Ahmed al-Farra, director of the hospital\u2019s pediatric ward, confirmed to NBC News that Seela had died from hypothermia, a medical emergency that occurs when the body\u2019s temperature drops to dangerously low levels. Dying from hypothermia can take hours or days, with babies and children especially vulnerable.",
      "He added that he is tending to such cases daily, with at least four babies dying from the bitter cold in Gaza in the past week.",
      "\u201cEvery day, we have two to three cases of hypothermia,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is catastrophic and a disaster.\u201d",

      "Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said Tuesday that that rate meant one child in Gaza is killed every hour.",
      "As a harsh winter sets in across the besieged territory, temperatures in southern Gaza have dropped especially low at night, with most Palestinians in displaced tents unable to find ways to stay warm in the cold, wind and rain.",
      "\u201cCold injuries, such as frostbite and hypothermia, pose grave risks to young children in tents and other makeshift shelters that are ill-equipped for freezing weather,\u201d Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF\u2019s regional director for the Middle East, said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWith temperatures expected to drop further in the coming days, it is tragically foreseeable that more children\u2019s lives will be lost to the inhumane conditions they are enduring, which offer no protection from the cold,\u201d he added.",
      "Beigbeder said that aid workers\u2019 ability to provide essential winter protection like blankets, warm clothing and other emergency supplies is severely restricted by the limited humanitarian aid Israeli authorities are allowing into Gaza.",
      "Lazzarini said Friday that blankets and other winter supplies \u201chave been stuck in the region for months waiting for approval to get into Gaza.\u201d",
      "COGAT, Israel\u2019s military liaison with the Palestinians, said in a post on X Sunday that over the past three months, the agency had facilitated the entry of 9,300 tons of winter-related items into Gaza, for a total of 24,000 tons of winter supplies since the start of the war.",
      "Mahmoud Faseeh described his family\u2019s situation as \u201charsh\u201d in the sands of al-Mawasi, once a seaside village along southern Gaza\u2019s Mediterranean coast that has since become a crowded tent camp for hundreds of thousands of the enclave\u2019s displaced people.",
      "\u201cWe sleep on the sand without any covers, and the tent does not protect us from the cold and chill,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s a very tragic life, exhaustion, and the children are constantly sick due to the cold and the effects of the war.\u201d",
      "Ahmad al-Zahrani, a nurse working at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, is among those who have died from the cold weather in recent days.",
      "His body was found inside a tent in al-Mawasi on Friday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement confirming his death. \u201cAhmad al-Zahrani has passed away due to the severe cold that the residents of the Gaza Strip are experiencing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis incident comes amidst the difficult humanitarian conditions faced by displaced citizens, as the suffering of Gaza\u2019s residents increases due to falling temperatures and a lack of heating resources in the tents,\u201d it continued.",
      "The war that followed the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks that Israeli officials say killed 1,200 people in southern Israel has decimated Gaza.",

      "This week, UNICEF issued a stark warning against the war\u2019s disproportionate impact on Gaza\u2019s children, especially during the winter.",
      "\u201cWinter has now descended on Gaza. Children are cold, wet and barefoot. Many still wear summer clothes. With cooking gas gone, many are searching through rubble for scraps of plastic to burn,\u201d Rosalia Bollen, a UNICEF spokesperson, said during a press briefing in Geneva."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A South Korean court issued warrants Tuesday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol and search his office and residence over allegations of rebellion in connection with his short-lived declaration of martial law.",
      "It\u2019s the first time a warrant has been issued to detain a sitting South Korean president. But experts say there is little chance of detention or searches unless Yoon is formally removed from office.",
      "The Seoul Western District Court issued warrants to detain Yoon and to search the presidential office and residence in central Seoul, according to a statement from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military authorities.",
      "The agency says it\u2019s been investigating whether Yoon\u2019s Dec. 3 declaration amounted to rebellion.",
      "Under South Korean law, the leader of a rebellion can face the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "Yoon\u2019s powers have been suspended since the opposition-controlled National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, during which hundreds of troops and police officers were deployed at the assembly. By law, a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament\u2019s operations even under martial law.",
      "Yoon has argued his decree was a legitimate act of governance, calling it a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party \u2014 which he has called \u201ca monster\u201d and \u201canti-state forces\u201d \u2014 that has used its legislative majority to impeach top officials, undermine the government\u2019s budget, and which he claims sympathizes with North Korea.",
      "The Constitutional Court is to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him.",
      "Experts said Yoon is likely to ignore the warrants.",
      "Yoon Kap-keun, a lawyer for the president, called the detainment warrant \u201cinvalid\u201d and \u201cillegal,\u201d saying the anti-corruption agency lacks legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. The presidential security service said it will provide security to Yoon in accordance with the law.",
      "The anti-corruption agency said it has no immediate plans on when it would proceed with the warrants.",
      "\u201cUnless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,\u201d said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. \u201cShould investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?\u201d",
      "Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon\u2019s residence to show they are strictly and fairly carrying out their work.",
      "Park Sung-min, president of Seoul-based political consulting firm MIN Consulting, said the push for an arrest warrant is likely an attempt to pressure Yoon to cooperate with investigations.",
      "Former President Park Geun-hye, who was thrown out of office in 2017 following an impeachment over a corruption scandal, also refused to meet with prosecutors while in office. She underwent questioning by them and was arrested after the Constitutional Court removed her from office.",
      "Yoon\u2019s imposition of martial law lasted only six hours but triggered huge political turmoil, halting high-level diplomacy and rattling financial markets. Despite Yoon\u2019s deployment of troops and police, enough lawmakers managed to enter the assembly chamber to overturn it unanimously.",
      "Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the martial law enactment.",
      "Yoon has claimed he wasn\u2019t trying to stop the functioning of the assembly, saying that the troops were sent to maintain order, and also denied planning to arrest politicians. But comments by now-arrested commanders of military units sent to the assembly have contradicted this claim.",
      "Kwak Jong-keun, the commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, testified at the National Assembly that Yoon called on troops to \u201cquickly knock down the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.\u201d Kwak said he did not carry out Yoon\u2019s orders.",
      "The country\u2019s political crisis deepened last Friday, when the Democratic Party and other small opposition parties voted to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo as well over wrangling over his refusal to fill in three justice seats at the nine-member Constitutional Court. Observers say adding more justices could increase prospects for the court\u2019s endorsement of Yoon\u2019s impeachment as that requires support from at least six justices.",
      "The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, has become South Korea\u2019s new interim leader. On Tuesday, Choi appointed two new justices, saying he feels the urgency to resolve political uncertainty and national divide."

    "summary": "Sanctions introduced after Vladimir Putin launched his war in Ukraine are affecting the price of Russia's traditional new year dish, the Olivier Salad.",
    "story": [
      "MOSCOW \u2014 It\u2019s akin to Turkey at Thanksgiving: On New Year\u2019s in Russia, revelers traditionally consume lashings of Olivier salad.",
      "It was introduced to the then-Russian Empire in 1860 by French chef Lucien Olivier, but these days everyone has a slightly different recipe. It\u2019s so popular that the cost of its staple ingredients \u2014 which usually include sausage, potatoes and dollops of mayonnaise \u2014 have their own price index that\u2019s tracked by the media.",
      "With soaring inflation and the ruble dropping to one of its lowest levels against the dollar since President Vladimir Putin launched his war in Ukraine, this year Russians will have to pay more for the dish, which is traditionally served alongside caviar and tangerines, before the New Year is toasted in.",
      "Along with rising food prices, a weaker ruble following the latest round of American sanctions in November has fueled inflation and driven up the cost of imports into Russia. A huge increase in military spending has also led to labor, supply and production shortages. And while workers from every industry have volunteered or been called up to serve in Ukraine, farming has been among the worst affected.",
      "The so-called Olivier Index, which monitors how much it costs to make one of the salads for four people, is up 16% year over year, to 414 rubles from 348, according to Rosstat, Russia\u2019s federal statistics agency. (That\u2019s equivalent to a jump to $3.94 from $3.31.)",
      "And prices have shot up for other groceries such as eggs (up 45% since January) and butter (up almost 40%), according to data released this month by Rosstat. Potatoes, meanwhile, cost almost twice as much as they did a year ago. Between November and December alone, they rose 10% from 99.99 rubles to 109.99, according to an NBC News analysis. While not a staple food, caviar has shot up to almost 9,000 rubles per kilo from 6,000 in December 2023, Rosstat found.",
      "So ordinary people, for whom the average salary is around $830 a month, are feeling the pinch.",
      "\u201cEverything\u2019s getting more expensive \u2014 bread, meat, vegetables, fruit,\u201d Svetlana Govorukhina told NBC News in a telephone interview earlier this month.",
      "\u201cI can see everything is getting more expensive but as I can still afford all I need,\u201d added Govorukhina, a 69-year-old music teacher from Kaluga, a city around 125 miles south of Moscow.",
      "\u201cI can support myself even in the current situation. But as long as I cannot do anything about the economic situation, I prefer not to waste my emotions on it,\u201d she added.",
      "But that puts her in the minority, as rising prices become the most pressing concern for Russians in most regions, according to a study published Dec. 27 by CROS, a Moscow-based marketing and communications agency. Prices replaced the war in Ukraine as the main concern for the first time since February 2022, when Putin ordered the invasion of his neighbor, according to the findings, which are based on analysis of social media trends and reports in traditional news media.",
      "\u201cThe rise in prices is particularly painful for the poorest, but the middle class \u2014 accustomed to higher levels of consumption and frequently purchasing imported goods \u2014 may feel the impact more acutely,\u201d Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin based nongovernmental organization, said earlier this month.",
      "And that was certainly the case for Moscow-based university worker Anna, 37, who said the cost of \u201cbaby foods, diapers and so on grew colossally,\u201d as sanctions started to bite shortly after Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine and her son turned 1.",
      "Prices \u201cbounced back a bit later, but since then everything has rather been getting more and more expensive,\u201d she said.",
      "Anna did not want her last name or the name of her husband to be published out of fear of retribution against her family. Putin\u2019s war next door has brought a far-reaching crackdown on dissent at home, and anything that can be perceived as an anti-war stance could result in arrest or even jail time.",
      "She added that meat and fruit prices had also risen, but she was still prepared to splurge.",
      "\u201cWhen I see the final sum at the checkout, I start worrying as it used to be significantly smaller for the same list,\u201d Anna said. \u201cBut I still buy the same, I am not cutting back on anything.\u201d",
      "She added that she was going to make Olivier salad for New Year's but would use potatoes grown by her mother-in-law, who like many Russians is mindful of previous economic hardship and keeps her own vegetable garden.",
      "\u201cAs for the sparkling wine, we will go with Italian. We are ready to pay more for it,\u201d Anna said.",
      "Her husband\u2019s \u201cmajor complaint is that there is no good beer anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just does not like Russian beer brands.\u201d",
      "An overheating economy?",
      "Addressing the economy at his annual end-of-year news conference earlier this month, Putin said that inflation was a problem and that  the country\u2019s economy was \u201coverheating.\u201d In part, he blamed international sanctions for price rises, \u201cbecause they make logistics more expensive,\u201d but he also appeared to criticize Russia\u2019s central bank for failing to tame inflation.",
      "In an apparent response, the bank did not raise its interest rate to 23% the following day, a move that had been widely expected.",
      "While the social and financial difficulties have yet to translate into significant political dissent \u201ceven with substantial repression,\u201d avoiding large-scale anger over economic issues \u201cmatters to the authorities and it appears to matter to Putin,\u201d Alex Brideau, of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political risk consultancy, said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "He added that Putin had \u201cbeen able to shift the blame for high prices away from himself and onto the government or businesses in the past and will probably do that again.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said, the rising prices would \u201cput a lot of pressure on the government to show that it is handling the situation with minimal disruption to the public\u2019s holiday festivities.",
      "Back in Russia, music teacher Govorukhina was determined to make the best of the New Year celebrations.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t eat a lot when we were younger, and now as we have gotten older we need even less. I can afford caviar, but not crab meat, though it is now hard to find a good one,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI have friends who complain, but I am not like that. Your lifestyle is more important than money. I love music and going to concerts, I love my job \u2014 this helps to somewhat cushion these blows. We have never had a rich life.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had universities in Idlib for more than eight years,\u201d Sharaa said, adding: \u201cI think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%.\u201d",

      "And fears have grown that the delicate and relative peace that has washed over Syria in the days since Assad's overthrow could be easily disrupted. Protests by members of the Alawite community, the minority sect the Assad family belongs to, erupted last week in Homs after video showing an Alawite shrine in Aleppo being vandalized circulated online.",
      "The demonstrations prompted the country's revamped security forces to institute new security measures in Homs, the country's third-largest city, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters also took to the streets in Christian neighborhoods of Damascus last week after a Christmas tree burning deepened fears that new leadership would still oversee a crackdown on religious minorities in the country.",
      "But in Homs, which has a diverse population of Sunni and Shia Muslims, as well as Christians and Alawites, a relatively peaceful Christmas in the Christian suburb of Fayrouzeh appeared to help assuage some fears.",
      "\u201cWe had a very beautiful holiday even though there was some anxiety before it,\u201d one Fayrouzeh resident, Sarab Kashi, told the AP. \u201cThe guys from HTS volunteered and stood as guards on the door of the churches.\u201d",
      "But whether Syria\u2019s new leadership will be able to maintain that relative calm remains to be seen, with the international community keeping a close eye on the shifting circumstances in Damascus."
