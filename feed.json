      "Last year, trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342.6bn and was already forecast to grow, but the government said the deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.",

    "story": [
      "The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets.",
      "DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at \u00a32.9bn and will create a  company with operations in more than 40 countries.",
      "While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years.",
      "Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens.",
      "Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items \u2013 like nappies, flowers and pet food.",
      "Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time \u2013 Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much.",
      "This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value \u2013 its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets.",
      "Let's look at another measure \u2013 the price of each share.",
      "An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%.",
      "An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%.",
      "What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival \u2013 just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit.",
      "One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets.",
      "UK's Deliveroo to be bought by US firm DoorDash",
      "This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing.",
      "There are many reasons.",
      "Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half.",
      "How can there be such a huge disparity?",
      "Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies \u2013 the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla)",
      "Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings \u2013 still a massive premium to the UK.",
      "One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand.",
      "UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled.",
      "Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds.",
      "But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets \u2013 and they have been dead right.",
      "In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%.",
      "Positive comments",
      "But there are changes afoot.",
      "The government's so-called \"Edinburgh Reforms\", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others.",
      "There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan.",
      "They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year.",
      "The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market.",
      "Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had \"no immediate\" plans to move, he and his company \"got a very warm welcome\" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it.",
      "What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals.",
      "Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges.",
      "But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here.",
      "Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate.",
      "Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract."

      "OpenAI, the parent of artificial intelligence service ChatGPT, has announced a new governance plan after a bitter power struggle over the business.",
      "Boss Sam Altman said OpenAI would remain under the control of its non-profit board, while becoming what is known in the US as a public benefit corporation.",
      "Mr Altman had put forward a similar plan in December - but without clarifying the control of the non-profit.",
      "The update follows widespread scrutiny of the startup, which began as a non-profit and faced criticism, including from co-founder Elon Musk, that its quest for growth is pushing it to stray from its original mission of creating technology for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Last month, a group of former open AI staff and outside experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, wrote to regulators in California and Delaware, which have power over non-profits, asking them to intervene to block the conversion.",

      "In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said the non-profit would continue to control OpenAI, receiving a \"big\", yet-to-be determined stake in OpenAI's business arm, which would give it access to money to put towards its own goals.",
      "He said the new plan would still allow the organisation to stop operating under its current complex governance structure, which had capped its profits.",
      "That was seen as a sticking point for investors, including Microsoft, that hindered the firm's ability to raise money.",
      "\"We are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock,\" he wrote in a letter to staff that was shared on the OpenAI website. \"This is not a sale, but a change of structure to something simpler.\"",
      "Unlike traditional for-profit companies, which are bound to act in service to shareholders, a public benefit corporation is also responsible for a public mission.",
      "In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said he believed that growth and extending access to AI, which would take money, was consistent with the firm's mission, because it would help people \"build incredible things for each other and continue to drive society and quality of life forward\".",

    "story": [
      "The pace at 64-year-old Thirunavkarsu's spinning mill in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has noticeably slowed down.",
      "The viscose yarn \u2013 a popular material that goes into making woven garments \u2013 he produces, now sits in storage, as orders from local factories have dropped nearly 40% in the last month.",
      "That's because Chinese imports of the material have become cheaper by 15 rupees ($0.18; \u00a30.13) per kilo and flooded Indian ports.",
      "With Donald Trump imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods going into the US, manufacturers in China have begun looking for alternative markets.",
      "India's textiles makers say they are bearing the brunt of the trade tensions as Chinese producers are dumping yarn in key production hubs.",
      "While China is the leading producer of viscose yarn, India makes most of the viscose yarn the country needs locally with imports only bridging supply gaps.",
      "Mill owners like Thirunavkarsu fear their yarn won't survive the onslaught of such competition.",
      "\"We can't match these rates. Our raw material is not as cheap,\" he says.",
      "Jagadesh Chandran, of the South India Spinners Association, told the BBC nearly 50 small spinning mills in the textile hubs of Pallipalayam, Karur and Tirupur in southern India are \"slowing production\". Many say they'll be forced to scale down further if the issue isn't addressed.",
      "China's Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has sent assurances to India that his country will not dump products and in fact wants to buy more high-quality Indian products for Chinese consumers.",
      "\"We will not engage in market dumping or cut-throat competition, nor will we disrupt other countries' industries and economic development,\" he wrote in an opinion piece for the Indian Express newspaper.",
      "But anxieties about dumping are spread across sectors in India, as China - Asia's biggest economy - is the world's largest exporter of practically all industrial goods, from textiles and metals, to chemicals and rare minerals.",
      "While pharmaceuticals - and later phones, laptops, and semiconductor chips - were exempted from steep tariffs, large chunks of Chinese exports still run into Trump's 145% tariff wall. It is these goods that are expected to chase other markets like India.",
      "Their sudden inflow will prove \"very disruptive\" to emerging economies in Asia, according to Japanese broking house Nomura, whose research earlier revealed that China was flooding global markets with cheap goods even before Donald Trump took office earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, investigations against unfair Chinese imports rose to a record high. Data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) shows nearly 200 complaints were filed against China at the forum - a record - including 37 from India.",
      "India, in particular, with heavy dependencies on Chinese raw materials and intermediate goods, could be hit hard. Its trade deficit with China - the difference between what it imports and exports - has already ballooned to $100bn (\u00a375bn). And imports in March jumped 25%, driven by electronics, batteries and solar cells.",
      "In response, India's trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with its quasi-judicial arm probing imports across sectors, including viscose yarn.",
      "India also recently imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports, locally known as a safeguard duty, to help halt an increase in cheap shipments primarily from China, which were pushing some Indian mills to scale down.",
      "Despite such protections - and a loud marketing campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to boost manufacturing locally - India has found it hard to reduce its reliance on China, with imports rising even when border tensions between the two neighbours peaked after 2020.",
      "That's because the government has only had \"limited success\" with its plans to turn India into the world's factory through things like the production linked subsidies, says Biswajit Dhar, a Delhi-based trade expert. And India continues to depend heavily on China for the intermediate goods that go into manufacturing finished products.",
      "While western multi-national companies like Apple are increasingly looking towards India to diversify their assembly lines away from China, India is still dependent on Chinese components to make these phones. As a result, imports in sectors like electronics have risen significantly, pushing up its trade deficit.",
      "India's burgeoning deficit is a \"worrying story\", says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) think tank, all the more so because its exports to China have dropped to below 2014 levels despite a weaker currency, which should ideally help exporters.",
      "\"This isn't just a trade imbalance. It's a structural warning. Our industrial growth, including through PLI (production linked incentive) schemes, is fuelling imports, not building domestic depth,\" Srivastava wrote in a social media post. In other words, the subsidies are not helping India export more.",
      "\"We can't bridge this deficit without bridging our competitiveness gap.\"",
      "India needs to get its act together quickly to do that, given the opportunity US trade tensions with China have presented. But also because countries with a large rise in imports from China generally tend to see the sharpest slowdown in manufacturing growth, according to Nomura.",
      "Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital agrees. A key reason why Indian private companies were not investing enough, was because they feared being \"swamped by China\", he wrote in a column in the Business Standard newspaper. A recent study by the ratings agency Icra also corroborates this view.",
      "With fears of Chinese dumping becoming more widespread and the likes of the European Union seeking firm guarantees from Beijing that its markets will not be flooded, pressure is mounting on China - which is now urgently looking to secure newer trading partners outside the US.",
      "China wants to completely shift the narrative, says Mr Dhar, \"It is trying to come clean amidst increased scrutiny\".",
      "Despite the reassurances from Beijing, Delhi should use thawing relations with its larger neighbour to kickstart a proper dialogue on its firm stance about dumping, says Mr Dhar.",
      "\"This is an issue that India must flag, like most of the Western countries have.\"",

      "Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "In response, the UK government said trade negotiations with Washington were ongoing and it was taking a \"calm and steady approach\" to talks in a bid to \"ease pressure on UK businesses\".",
      "UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being \"jobless\" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a \"knock-out blow\".",
      "The UK film sector is worth \u00a31.36 billion and employs more than 195,000 people, the government said in October.",
      "Much of the detail of the new tariff has yet to be confirmed.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said later on Monday: \"Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again.\"",
      "But there is worry that UK film companies, which often produce movies with US firms - including recent blockbusters like Barbie and Wicked - could be badly hit.",
      "\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of UK production company Goldfinch, said.",
      "Philippa Childs, head of media and entertainment trade union, Bectu, echoed those fears: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",
      "A parliamentary committee's report published last month noted the UK's film and high-end television industry is \"dominated\" by inward investment from US studios and that this \"brings significant economic and social benefits to the UK\".",
      "Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage said on Monday that MPs had warned \"against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe\" when the report came out.",
      "\"President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real,\" she said.",
      "Dame Caroline argued that making it more difficult to produce films in the UK was not in the interests of American businesses, many of which have invested in UK facilities, such as sound stages and studios.",
      "She urged ministers to \"urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way\".",
      "Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew said Labour must \"get a grip\" to secure a trade deal with the US and \"protect the UK film industry, otherwise we risk seeing long-term damage to a sector that is a global success\".",
      "Trump says non-US movies to be hit with 100% tariffs",
      "What impact might Trump's Hollywood tariffs plan have?",
      "Hollywood's big boom has gone bust",
      "It is still not entirely clear whether Trump's plans will affect only British films exported to the US or if it will also have an impact on co-productions, as referenced by Bell and others. The uncertainty itself is worrying for many.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Tim Richards, CEO and founder of Vue Entertainment, said: \"The devil will be in the details and we need to parcel through exactly what [Trump] means.",
      "\"A big part of this is what constitutes US film, is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?",
      "\"Hollywood\u2026 has been in decline for some time,\" he said. \"A lot of films are being shot in other states and in other markets, principally Canada, the UK and Australia.\"",
      "He added: \"One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world.\"",
      "Bell concurred that \"the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places\" and lower costs.",
      "\"People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed.\"",
      "She added: \"The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood.\"",
      "According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20\u202f percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (\u00a3248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive.",
      "A government spokesperson said on Monday: \"The film sector is a key part of the UK's world-class creative industries, which employ millions of people, generate billions for our economy and showcase the best of our creativity and culture to the world.",
      "\"We are absolutely committed to ensuring these sectors can continue to thrive and create good jobs right across the country, and will set this out through a new Creative Industries Sector Plan to be published soon.",
      "\"Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing - but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest.

      "More than half of first-time buyers received financial help from their family to make house purchases last year, according to estimates by estate agency Savills.",
      "An average of \u00a355,572 was given in loans and gifts by the so-called bank of mum and dad to buyers, it said.",
      "Young buyers faced relatively high mortgage rates in 2024, while also seeing the cost of renting increase.",
      "More recently, changes to stamp duty led to a rush of new buyers before the end of March, but greater costs for anyone who missed that deadline.",
      "More help, better deal",
      "The annual report by Savills suggests that 52% of first-time buyers received assistance from the bank of mum and dad last year, which could also include other donors from the family.",
      "This was a slightly lower proportion than the 57% of the previous year, but higher than every other year since 2013.",
      "Family assistance peaked in 2009 during the fallout from the financial crisis, when 70% of first-time buyers received help, the estate agency's figures suggest.",
      "It estimated 173,500 first-time buyers received assistance last year, receiving a total of \u00a39.6bn.",
      "The findings are based on first-time buyer and average loan-to-value data, as well as how this relates to responses from various surveys about family support.",
      "The average rate for all new two and five-year fixed mortgages last year was between 5% and 6%, figures from financial information service Moneyfacts show.",
      "That rate would be higher for many first-time buyers unable to offer a large deposit, and much higher than a few years earlier.",
      "Buyers facing that scenario \"took advantage of greater family support to try and secure a deal at a lower mortgage rate\", according to Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills.",
      "\"First-time buyers are still feeling the impact of higher mortgage rates and tougher lending criteria,\" he said.",

      "Five ways for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder",

      "Many potential first-time buyers have also faced financial strain from the rising cost of living, and particularly from the greater expense of renting, although the latter may have encouraged more to get on to the ladder more quickly.",
      "The annual increase in rent paid to private landlords breached 9% last year, forcing many to live with their parents in their 20s and 30s.",
      "Financial assistance varies across the country, as do house prices and average incomes.",
      "And stamp duty, which was primarily levied on buyers in the south of England, changed in April.",

      "Analysis by the Yorkshire Building Society suggests the first three months of this year saw the highest number of first-time buyer applications since the 2022 post-Covid peak.",
      "Mr Cook, from Savills, added that the likelihood of regulators allowing lenders to loosen some of their lending criteria could also benefit first-time buyers and their families.",
      "\"[This means] lowering the barrier for entry and allowing first-time buyers to qualify for larger mortgages,\" he said.",

    "summary": "In his exclusive BBC interview, the Canadian Prime Minister indicates how he plans to tackle Trump.",
    "story": [
      "On Mark Carney's final day of a gruelling race to be elected PM of vast and sparsely populated Canada I was with him.",
      "It was his last push, not just to win, but also to get the majority he said he needed to stand up to the chaotic territorial and trade ambitions of his \"neighbour to the south\".",
      "For someone who had got to see Carney as a cerebral technocrat, a crisis-managing central bank governor a decade ago, the transformation into public orator was quite something.",
      "I recall endless interviews trying to get the then governor to say something newsworthy, or something that would make a good headline.",
      "While this was a very different Mark Carney, the lineage in crisis economics was also part of his sell.",
      "Carney told his audience in Edmonton, Alberta, sporting the local Oilers hockey shirt: \"President Trump has ruptured the global economy... America's leadership of the global economy is over. It's still in play, but it is a tragedy, and our new reality\u2026 in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win\".",
      "His supporters shouted \"Elbows Up\" and put them up, a reference to a stand up and fight back posture in the occasionally rough game of ice hockey.",
      "\"What we are seeing around the country is Canadians acting on behalf of other Canadians, standing up for each other, buying from each other, travelling here...\"",
      "At his very final stop in the far West, in the isolation of Victoria, Vancouver Island, with only half an hour of campaigning allowed, Carney went \"unplugged\" among supporters.",
      "\"As the assembled media will tell you, I campaigned in prose,\" Carney joked. \"So I'm going to govern in econometrics,\" he said of the nerdy mathematical strain of economics.",
      "In normal circumstances, some of this might be interesting to the wider world. In current circumstances, the origins of his election win, his approach to policy making, and the nature of his mandate, could assume critical importance.",
      "When I caught up with him for the BBC exclusive interview, just as the polls were closing on Monday, he appeared confident but was taking nothing for granted.",
      "Fighting threats to sovereignty",
      "Mr Carney's central argument remained consistent. He said he was the leader to take on Donald Trump's \"betrayal\" and threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty.",
      "It was exemplified by his final large rally on the US-Canada border, with the Ambassador Bridge and a skyline of iconic Detroit motoring firms behind him.",
      "This bridge is the main artery of Canadian-US trade. A lot of effort went into this backdrop of the two-way trade of the most integrated economies in the world, now tariffed at unimaginable levels. An unsubtle message from the Liberal Party leader, about a changed continent.",
      "The election result was staggering.",
      "Entering 2025, the Liberal Party was as low as 16%, versus 45% for the opposition Conservatives, in opinion polls.",
      "Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives were not just heading for victory, but for a total landslide.",
      "But then following President Trump's imposition of national security tariffs on Canada, using the pretext of an alleged role in fentanyl traffic, and then his undiplomatic suggestion that Canada should join the USA, the polls tightened.",
      "Then after Mark Carney was elected Liberal leader, just eight weeks ago, the Liberals achieved a consistent poll lead, which they rode to victory last week.",
      "The election became a presidential-style verdict on who could cope with Trump.",
      "Poilievre was fundamentally weakened by previous overtures to the US president and his style of government.",
      "Carney incorporated voters on the left who were scared of a Conservative government amplified by Trump.",
      "And incredibly, in Quebec, the Liberals won back support from separatists, who were more concerned about Canada's independence from the US, than their own constitutional status within Canada. There is nothing more unifying than a credible external threat.",
      "Carney's strategy",
      "Carney gave some clues to his strategy during his interview with me. He talked of a \"win win\" partnership with the US, and reminded the president that Canada was the \"biggest client\" of 40 of the 50 US states, and a key energy and fertiliser supplier.",
      "He also told me he \"potentially could supply them with critical minerals\". This struck me as a negotiation tactic very targeted at what Trump has become fixated on elsewhere.",
      "Canada has ample resources of critical minerals, and would be a much more dependable supplier across the West than many other nations. Carney is implicitly suggesting, however, that his country has deep strategic choices to make here, on for example, developing them with Europe rather than the US.",
      "In any event, the PM will use the impetus of external threat to try to transform the Canadian economy. Even in the granting of an interview to BBC News, it was clear that he sees a critical need to diversify trade and strategic alliances. Defence partnerships are now on the cards.",
      "He seemed to acknowledge that a stalled Canada-UK trade deal could be expedited.",
      "On Friday he pulled off the historic announcement that King Charles would reopen the Canadian parliament in person at the end of the month. This has not happened since 1977. It is entirely in keeping with Canada's constitution, but it is also a stunning assertion of enduring independence from the White House.",
      "All roads now lead to the G7 Summit hosted by Carney in the middle of June in Alberta, bringing together the world's seven largest economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system.",
      "Assuming that Trump comes, it will occur within days of the expiry of the pause in massive so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on most of the world.",
      "It is often forgotten that if Canada and Mexico free themselves from the fentanyl tariffs, they will then, according to White House advisers, find themselves subject to this system, with a minimum of 10% tariffs.",
      "All of this occurs within days of some growing frustration from America's traditional allies with the entire \"trade deal\" process.",
      "Japan is increasingly frustrated, with its finance minister now openly pointing to Japan's unbeaten holding of US government debt as a \"card\" in negotiations.",
      "The EU has not got very far. Even the UK has hinted that a deal with Europe may be a more effective way of boosting the economy.",
      "It comes as tariffs are starting to have a visible and tangible negative impact on US businesses and consumers.",
      "There is no great incentive to offer much up, while the US itself starts to feel the inevitable inflationary consequences of its actions.",
      "The flotilla of empty Chinese cargo ships and empty docks on the US West Coast will soon be seen in the economic data of an already shrinking US economy.",
      "As a veteran of economic crises arising from the uncertain experiments of governments, Carney might be uniquely placed on how these situations pan out. Many in the markets have been thoroughly unimpressed with the White House advisers sent out to reassure investors in recent weeks.",
      "But Carney too has his own challenges. He just missed out on a majority in parliament, but has chosen to try to project this as a virtue.",
      "He will reach across the aisle for a \"Team Canada\" approach to talks with the US.",
      "The Premier of the oil-rich Alberta province, who is a regular visitor to Mar-a-Lago, immediately announced moves to make separation referendums easier.",
      "This is a very complicated, domestic, continental and global environment economically and politically. Few would predict exactly where it goes. Carney may have a very large part in it, and not just for his own country.",

      "The taxi app's success has been based around new technology, but meant customers needed cashless payments to use its services.",
      "Following pilots in Birmingham, Stoke, Nottingham and Leicester, Uber said it has now extended the option of paying in cash to other UK cities, because some people preferred paying in cash or did not have a bank card.",
      "\"We believe that movement should be accessible to everyone, so following successful pilots in some UK cities over the last 18 months, we have decided to give passengers outside of London the option to pay for trips with cash,\" a spokesman said.",
      "Passengers can select cash as their payment option on the app. Drivers can opt out in preferences on their own app.",
      "If they do not have enough change, that is given as a credit to the passenger by Uber.",
      "The cash option is being reviewed by authorities in London, and remains unavailable for Uber Eats or booking for other forms of transport via the Uber app.",
      "Tracing payments danger",
      "Cash campaigner Ron Delnevo from the Payment Choice Alliance said Uber's move \"demonstrates that they now believe in the future of cash in the UK\", and brought the company's operations in the UK in line with many other countries.",
      "He called on the government to introduce a law that would force all shops and services to accept cash.",
      "Ministers have said there are no plans to introduce such rules.",
      "However, the Treasury Committee's recent report did highlight various groups who relied on cash, including some people with learning disabilities and those who use cash to keep to a budget.",
      "Among those reliant on cash, and who gave evidence to the committee, were victim-survivors of domestic and economic abuse.",
      "Many face the dangers of being traced by their abuser via the payments they make. Buying a train ticket, for example, could only be done with cash in order to avoid an abusive partner becoming aware of their movements.",
      "\"It really is a matter of life and death,\" said Sam Smethers, chief executive of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse. \"Without it they find themselves monitored daily, with every transaction.\"",
      "Joint bank accounts and mortgages had also been used as a way to impose coercive control over somebody, she said.",
      "And cash could be used as an eventual escape route.",
      "\"One victim-survivor said she hid pockets of cash around her house until she had enough to flee her abuser,\" she said.",
      "The charity would like to see cash acceptance backed by law, but Ms Smethers said she welcomed the focus the committee's report had put on the plight of those facing economic abuse.",

      "A 25% import tax on engines, transmissions and other key car parts has come into force in the US, raising pressure on an industry finding its way through a thicket of policy changes.",
      "The new tariff comes days after Donald Trump eased the measure in response to business worries, but did not eliminate it.",
      "The US president has said the new tariff, along with a 25% import tax on cars that went into effect last month, is intended to push carmakers to do more manufacturing in the US.",
      "But analysts said any immediate expansions in the US were likely to come at the expense of production elsewhere, while also leading to higher costs for the businesses - and ultimately higher prices for customers.",
      "For now, companies have been shielded from pain, as concerns about price hikes have prompted a sales surge.",

      "The president has since softened his policies, especially regarding Mexico and Canada - key parts of the industry's supply chain, due to decades of free trade between the three countries.",
      "As it stands currently, parts made in Mexico and Canada in compliance with that free trade agreement will be spared the duties. Officials had initially described that exemption as temporary, but after customs instructions issued this week analysts said it now appeared likely to stick.",
      "Trump this week also signed measures to shield firms from facing multiple tariffs on the same item, while setting up a two-year system carmakers can use to reduce the duties they have to pay on parts imported from other countries and used in US-assembled cars.",
      "The administration had also already said firms importing cars made in Canada and Mexico would not be charged tariffs on US-made content.",
      "\"The changes that have come in the last couple of days are going to make it easier ... but even so it's still a dramatic change to the market,\" said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. \"It's still a big tariff.\"",

      "Mercedes also said it had flexibility to expand at its factory in Alabama.",
      "Art Wheaton, director of Labor Studies at Cornell University, said the US might see more such announcements in the months ahead, but he did not expect to see new factories getting built anytime soon, given the significance of that investment and how fast the situation is changing.",
      "\"If I'm going to make a multi-billion dollar decision... I wouldn't do it in a market that is this unstable,\" he said.",
      "The administration has said it is working on trade deals with key countries for the industry, including South Korea and Japan.",
      "Trump might also modify his policies if signs of economic damage start to emerge, Mr Wheaton said.",

    "story": [
      "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.",
      "With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.",
      "\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.",
      "His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.",
      "\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.",
      "The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.",
      "Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.",
      "Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.",
      "Mr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.",
      "\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.",
      "His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.",
      "\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.",
      "These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.",
      "\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.",
      "\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"",
      "In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.",
      "One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.",
      "EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.",
      "Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.",
      "And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.",
      "\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.",
      "For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.",
      "\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.",
      "This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.",
      "\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"",
      "By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.",
      "While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.",
      "For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.",
      "One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.",
      "The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.",
      "But it says good community relations are not enough.",
      "\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"",
      "On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.",
      "Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.",
      "Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.",
      "His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.",
      "Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.",
      "The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.",
      "While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark."

      "Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.",
      "People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford.",

      "When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.",
      "Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.",
      "\"Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,\" says Prof Angus.",
      "\"They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't.",
      "\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"",
      "Yet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for.",
      "In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise.",

      "\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",
      "\"They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. \"",
      "It's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases.",
      "Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.",
      "But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession.",
      "\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.",
      "\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.",
      "\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"",
      "While Andrew Brown of Wally's Weather is self taught in meteorology, he has a masters in IT and numerous other technology qualifications.",
      "His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs.",

      "\"I don't go out of my way to reveal who I am, because I like to be able to walk down the street and not be harassed. I've been interviewed on the radio before, and then walked past the person, and they had no idea it was me,\" says Mr Brown.",

      "Growing up in California, he was seduced by the false glamour of gang life.",
      "After his arrest in San Diego for gang activity, Alberto was sent back to Mexico just as President Trump was taking office, and found himself homeless and alone in the country of his birth.",
      "\"It was a shock. It still is,\" he admits. \"When I got here to Mexico, I really felt lost. No family, no food, no clothes, no nothing.\"",
      "Border crossings, egg prices and jobs - Trump's 100 days speech fact-checked",
      "Trump eases car tariffs after firms raised concerns",
      "Alberto says he'd almost forgotten how to speak and read Spanish. \"Good thing I didn't lose it completely because it's helped me [to be bilingual],\" he reflects.",
      "In fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company \u2013 EZ Call Center \u2013 was looking for English-speakers.",
      "The work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved.",
      "\"I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,\" he tells me during a break between calls.",
      "Almost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz.",
      "He was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico.",
      "\"We are all dealing with culture shock,\" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls.",
      "\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"",
      "In their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.",
      "All the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US.",
      "Daniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.",
      "\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.",
      "Daniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions.",
      "As well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.",
      "After his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation in American history\".",
      "He has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.",
      "Mexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.",
      "So far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing.",
      "The latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.",
      "However, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.",
      "The threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.",
      "The Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.",
      "Still, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.",
      "The few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.",
      "Beyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce.",
      "With its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.",
      "\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"",
      "Nora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.",
      "\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.",
      "The \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start.",
      "He grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,\" Luis explains.",
      "While in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech.",
      "Now 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.",
      "\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"",
      "For Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.",
      "\"From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,\" he adds.",
      "While the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months.",
      "If so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes.",

    "summary": "The real battleground of the current trade war might be China's domestic economy",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Laura read this article",
      "If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.",
      "The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.",
      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",
      "And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.",
      "\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.",
      "Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.",
      "The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.",
      "This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.",

    "summary": "Sir David says his new film Ocean is one of the most important of his career.",
    "story": [
      "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.",
      "He believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.",
      "Sir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"",
      "The ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.",
      "A blue carpet will be rolled out at the film's premiere tonight at the Royal Festival Hall.",
      "A host of celebrities are expected to attend including Chris Martin and Coldplay, Benedict Cumberbatch, astronaut Tim Peake, Geri Halliwell-Horner and Simon LeBon.",
      "Toby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.",
      "The film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.",
      "Sir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"",
      "Since then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.",
      "Ocean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.",
      "The new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.",
      "\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.",
      "The process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.",
      "Sir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".",
      "Sir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.",
      "It is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.",
      "Just one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"",
      "But in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.",
      "One of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"",
      "Despite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"",
      "Sir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.",
      "He believes that could be transformational.",
      "\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"",
      "A healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.",
      "\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.",
      "As he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.",

      "Several women in the selection pool said they had been victims of sexual abuse or assault or knew someone close who had.",
      "But more than a dozen said they could go into the case with an open mind and pledged not to form an opinion until they heard all the evidence.",

    "summary": "As Trump turns his attention to what he calls the \"dying\" US film industry, his solution has provoked strong reactions.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has said he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "He later said he would consult Hollywood executives to see if \"they're happy\" with his proposal, after the news sent shockwaves through the industry.",

      "Is Hollywood 'dying'?",
      "Announcing the new tariffs, Trump declared that Hollywood was \"dying\". So is it?",
      "It's true that the industry has been through a really rough time in recent years.",
      "The pandemic saw production close down and the impact is ongoing.",
      "Hollywood studios spent $11.3 billion on productions in the second quarter of 2024, a 20% drop from the same period in 2022, as studios continued to cut costs in an attempt to recover from Covid losses.",
      "Any shoots of recovery were then severely stifled by the 2023 actors and writers strikes.",
      "Then the wildfires struck earlier this year.",
      "And for several years now, more and more people - not just youngsters - have been turning to YouTube and other streaming platforms for content.",
      "The US remains a major film production hub and according to Variety, 2025 has seen a rebound in box office numbers since last year, with overall domestic revenues up 15.8% on 2024 so far.",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "The latest Marvel superhero film, Thunderbolts*, topped the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million, marking a promising start to the summer season.",
      "But Hollywood is definitely still up against it.",
      "What is Trump proposing?",
      "The president says he wants to \"immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands. We want movies made in America again!\"",
      "This has led to questions about whether the tariffs would also apply to American film companies producing films abroad.",
      "Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. Hit franchises like Mission Impossible also shoot overseas.",
      "We also don't yet know if the tariffs will be applied retrospectively.",
      "Trump later told reporters that \"other nations have been stealing the movies and movie-making capabilities from the United States\", which may suggest he was only referring to non-US films.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC that \"no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made\", and added that the administration is \"exploring all options\".",
      "We will have to wait for more detail.",
      "What incentives do other countries offer?",
      "Many countries offer tax breaks to encourage film production such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK and that's something Trump wants to take on.",
      "But it's not the only reason a US film company might wish to film abroad.",
      "Some choose to do so for the specific location, exotic and exciting backdrops for example. Who could forget Tom Cruise's ascent of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol?",
      "What could it mean for the next James Bond movie, a franchise now owned by US giant Amazon, but based on an iconic British character who works for MI6, based in London?",
      "And it's not just other countries that offer incentives - other US states are luring film production away from Hollywood.",
      "Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky are among the many other US states which California are now competing with.",
      "Gavin Newsom, California's governor, who Trump described as \"grossly incompetent\" when speaking about the movie tariffs on Monday, is currently pushing for his plan to more than double the state's film and TV tax incentives to $750 million annually.",
      "While Newsom has made no comment yet on Trump's proposal, his senior communications advisor told Deadline: \"We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.\"",
      "How would any such tariffs actually work?",
      "There are more questions than answers at this stage.",
      "The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a moratorium on tariffs for digital goods until 2026. Presumably films count as digital goods.",
      "And what would they base the tariffs on? Box office revenue or production costs? Is streaming content included? That would have a huge impact on US companies like Netflix. What about post-production ie editing?",
      "Tim Richards, Vue Entertainment CEO and founder, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"A big part of this is what constitutes US film - is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?\"",
      "And how do you even classify a foreign film when so many are co-productions and are often shot in several countries?",
      "Trump appeared to be talking about film and not TV but it's not 100% clear at this stage. Would tariffs apply to films made for streaming or just cinema releases? We'll have to wait for more detail. And of course, Trump may rollback on the proposals as he has done with some other tariffs.",
      "What could it mean for other countries?",
      "Obviously, putting a 100% tariff on foreign films means a huge cost increase for those production companies who want to sell to the US market.",
      "Commenting on Trump's announcement, the UK government's Culture Media and Sport Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said: \"Last month the Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real.",
      "\"Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interests of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way.\"",
      "Head of media and entertainment trade union Bectu in the UK, Philippa Childs, said in a statement: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",
      "Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, questioned how the tariffs would work, pointing out that blockbusters like Barbie, which was distributed by US film studio Warner Bros Pictures, \"was actually shot virtually entirely in the UK\".",
      "\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\" she told PA.",
      "The governments of Australia and New Zealand have also spoken out in support of their countries' film industries.",
      "\"Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,\" Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said.",
      "New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference that his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs.",
      "\"But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,\" he added.",
      "And with the Cannes film festival just around the corner, uncertainty hangs in the air with many US film producers looking to sell foreign distribution rights.",
      "Could such tariffs work?",
      "Tariffs could incentivise US film companies to make more films on home soil but the risk is that if it's more expensive than to do so abroad, some films just won't get made.",
      "More incentives or rebates could help offset this but we just don't know at this stage if that's under discussion on a national scale.",
      "NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry.",
      "Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it \"harder for these films to make profits overseas\".",

    "summary": "It comes as moviemakers worry the UK's thriving film industry could be hit by the new tariff threat.",
    "story": [
      "Film tariffs are set to form part of trade negotiations between the UK and US after Donald Trump threatened to apply a 100% charge against movies made in foreign countries.",
      "Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "In response, the UK government said trade negotiations with Washington were ongoing and it was taking a \"calm and steady approach\" to talks in a bid to \"ease pressure on UK businesses\".",
      "UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being \"jobless\" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a \"knock-out blow\".",
      "The UK film sector is worth \u00a31.36 billion and employs more than 195,000 people, the government said in October.",
      "Much of the detail of the new tariff has yet to be confirmed.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said later on Monday: \"Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again.\"",
      "But there is worry that UK film companies, which often produce movies with US firms - including recent blockbusters like Barbie and Wicked - could be badly hit.",
      "\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of UK production company Goldfinch, said.",
      "Philippa Childs, head of media and entertainment trade union, Bectu, echoed those fears: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",
      "A parliamentary committee's report published last month noted the UK's film and high-end television industry is \"dominated\" by inward investment from US studios and that this \"brings significant economic and social benefits to the UK\".",
      "Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage said on Monday that MPs had warned \"against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe\" when the report came out.",
      "\"President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real,\" she said.",
      "Dame Caroline argued that making it more difficult to produce films in the UK was not in the interests of American businesses, many of which have invested in UK facilities, such as sound stages and studios.",
      "She urged ministers to \"urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way\".",
      "Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew said Labour must \"get a grip\" to secure a trade deal with the US and \"protect the UK film industry, otherwise we risk seeing long-term damage to a sector that is a global success\".",
      "Trump says non-US movies to be hit with 100% tariffs",
      "What impact might Trump's Hollywood tariffs plan have?",
      "Hollywood's big boom has gone bust",
      "It is still not entirely clear whether Trump's plans will affect only British films exported to the US or if it will also have an impact on co-productions, as referenced by Bell and others. The uncertainty itself is worrying for many.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Tim Richards, CEO and founder of Vue Entertainment, said: \"The devil will be in the details and we need to parcel through exactly what [Trump] means.",
      "\"A big part of this is what constitutes US film, is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?",
      "\"Hollywood\u2026 has been in decline for some time,\" he said. \"A lot of films are being shot in other states and in other markets, principally Canada, the UK and Australia.\"",
      "He added: \"One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world.\"",
      "Bell concurred that \"the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places\" and lower costs.",
      "\"People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed.\"",
      "She added: \"The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood.\"",
      "According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20\u202f percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (\u00a3248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive.",
      "A government spokesperson said on Monday: \"The film sector is a key part of the UK's world-class creative industries, which employ millions of people, generate billions for our economy and showcase the best of our creativity and culture to the world.",
      "\"We are absolutely committed to ensuring these sectors can continue to thrive and create good jobs right across the country, and will set this out through a new Creative Industries Sector Plan to be published soon.",
      "\"Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing - but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest. We will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks and aim to find a resolution to help ease the pressure on UK businesses and consumers.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 17:19:24 GMT",
    "summary": "A play examines how Port Talbot saw the arrival of a Banksy in town - and the death of its industry.",
    "story": [
      "What happens to a town when the UK's most talked about artist leaves an unannounced drawing on a garage wall?",
      "Season's Greetings, by the anonymous artist Banksy, appeared in Port Talbot in December 2018, days before Christmas, prompting a rush of visitors to swell the back lanes where the commentary on the town's famous steel industry now resided.",
      "The drawing, across two walls at right angles, showed a boy playing joyously in a downfall of snow \u2013 but turn the corner and the viewer sees the \"snow\" is actually ash falling from a fire burning in a bin, echoing the larger plumes of smoke emitted day and night at the steelworks.",
      "Now that event \u2013 and the wider story of the town's fate \u2013 has been turned into a play, Port Talbot Gotta Banksy, based entirely on transcripts of the townsfolk's response.",
      "Tracy Harris and Paul Jenkins, south Wales-based playwrights, had worked together on a previous project using the same technique of verbatim speech, that time gathered from young people they were devising a show with, and were looking for ideas for another.",
      "When they heard about the Banksy and went to visit, a chance conversation with a fellow director who said \"someone should write a play about this\" gave Paul \"one of those lightbulb moments,\" that the material might be right under their noses.",
      "However neither anticipated that what began as a plan to capture the response to a singular event would grow into a six-year labour of love documenting the end of a 100-year way of life for a working-class community.",
      "What to do if you wake up with a Banksy on your wall",
      "What do we know about Banksy?",
      "They hired Banksy for \u00a350 then painted over his mural",
      "Paul said of Season's Greetings: \"It was a beautiful piece of art and we realised that the people in Port Talbot recognised that as well and they really, really loved it and took it into their hearts.\"",
      "\"We were at the site every day, talking and listening to the community's opinions and feelings and responses to the Banksy, what they thought about the theme of it, the pollution, steelworks, all of that. And it just started there.\"",
      "A version of the play could have happened at an earlier point but then \"Covid happened\".",
      "\"And then by a stroke of luck or genius, the story kept developing,\" said Tracy.",
      "There were the twists and turns with the artwork itself \u2013 first it was protected by security at the site, then bought by an English art collector to go on display in the town, with a promise it would always remain there.",
      "That failed to happen and the piece was finally removed to an undisclosed location in England in February 2022.",
      "But the other story which weaved into and over the Banksy was the devastating news that steel production as it had existed for most people's lifetimes would end.",
      "And it was only when the works' blast furnace got switched off in September 2024 that Tracy and Paul finally decided it was time to stop gathering interviews and devise the play.",
      "Over the course of six years the pair collected more than 100 hours of recordings that they have managed to boil down to a two-hour play.",
      "\"It's made it such a universal story now, much bigger than what we originally thought,\" said Tracy.",
      "Paul added: \"When we started, we thought it was going to be a story about the Banksy, the first Banksy in Wales and what people thought of it.",
      "\"But of course it became much more about the theme of the Banksy, drawing attention to the pollution from the steelworks, and then of course when the threat to the steelworks [happened] it's become much more a gritty portrait of that community and their resilience.",
      "\"They were gifted the Banksy at Christmas \u2013 that was taken away from them. And now the blast furnaces, the industry that they've had for 100 years, although hopefully it is going to transition to green steel and an electric arc furnace, at the moment the blast furnaces have just been switched off.",
      "\"So there's this terrible sense of uncertainty hanging over the town. The pollution, the theme that Banksy highlighted, is gone, but at the cost of thousands and thousands of jobs in the town.\"",
      "Every word said on stage is an absolute reproduction of words spoken by real people. Six actors represent people Tracy and Paul went back to again and again over the years as well as a host of other voices.",
      "Even their lines are not learned but delivered through headsets directly to the actors as they say them.",
      "The tale is told in chronological order but from a wide range of differing perspectives, with some news reports and headlines added to help the audience understand the latest development where necessary.",
      "One of the people represented in the show is a steelworker who's started spray painting, highlighting a type of transformation that has occurred within the town even as it faces the consequences of the loss of its industrial heritage.",
      "Tracy said: \"Port Talbot's become the street art capital of Wales suddenly. Even though it's a sad story, it's also a story of hope because [the people] do bounce back.",
      "\"They've decided to make the town a colourful town and start spray painting everywhere.\"",
      "\"The legacy of the Banksy is there's an incredible street art scene now. So many local artists, so many walls are covered in colour and amazing art,\" adds Paul.",
      "\"The colour of the town has changed. It's gone from being a grey, industrial town where the skies are full of smoke all the time to being a really colourful town.\"",
      "Doing the research for the play helped give voice to people who \"often have no say in what's happening\", but it also revealed to the pair the breadth of talent across the arts in Port Talbot.",
      "\"What's beautiful about this play is you see it from a community's point of view, and you see it from all those voices you would never normally hear, who would never get a chance to tell their side of the story and what that art meant to them and how important it was to their town,\" says Tracy.",
      "\"It's so poetic sometimes the way they describe it.\"",
      "Paul says at the start of the process they had assumed at some points they would have to write in some lines to join the pieces of the story together, but found that their interviewees had done it for them naturally.",
      "\"The people of Port Talbot are incredible storytellers. I don't know what it is \u2013 it's probably a Welsh thing, it's definitely a Port Talbot thing \u2013 they are very good at telling their story,\" he says.",
      "Tracy chips in: \"We couldn't have asked for them to say anything better. It's almost like you couldn't write it sometimes. You're like, 'how did you say that? It's exactly what we needed you to say'.\"",

    "summary": "The US singer says she feels \"bruised\" after weeks of online backlash - what's sparked the change?",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this week American singer Katy Perry, best known for her bubblegum pop, said she felt like a \"human Pi\u00f1ata\" after weeks of online backlash.",
      "The description felt suitably colourful - but the acknowledgement was serious. A decade on from headlining the Superbowl, Perry's part in a much-derided Blue Origin spaceflight has seen her star crash down to Earth.",
      "Mockery over the apparent worthiness of her reaction, including kissing the ground after landing and saying she felt \"so connected to love\", spread online. Fast food chain Wendy's even posted to ask: \"Can we send her back?\"",
      "Trolls have now taken aim at her world tour, which began in Mexico on 23 April, criticising her dance moves and performances.",
      "It seems the star who first broke through singing about a boyfriend's mood swings now faces an icy reception. Perry's blamed an \"unhinged and unhealed\" internet - but is toxic social media the only reason?",
      "'A pattern of failed reinvention'",
      "The music writer Michael Cragg, author of Reach for the Stars, believes Perry's problem is that she's stuck between pop cultures and feels increasingly out of touch.",
      "\"Her pop star persona was cemented in the 2010s as cartoon-y, fun and playful, all whipped cream bras and goofy videos where she wore oversized braces on her teeth,\" he says.",
      "For a period this worked. Her second album Teenage Dream, which doubled down on Perry's staple cheeky, sexualised girl-next-door image, scored five Billboard number one singles to match a record set by Michael Jackson. Its follow-up, 2013's Prism, bore transatlantic smash single Roar (her fourth solo UK number one), as well as Dark Horse in the US (her ninth domestically). Perry hasn't topped charts under her own steam since.",
      "\"That was a long time ago in pop terms and it feels like she hasn't evolved,\" adds Cragg.",
      "In the past year, her comeback single Woman's World, touted as a female empowerment anthem, struck critics as lyrically shallow.",
      "Some fans also seemed unimpressed that it was produced by Dr. Luke, who previously faced sexual assault allegations from the singer Kesha. The producer denied the claims and the pair reached an agreement to settle a defamation lawsuit in 2023, but Perry remained tainted by association.",
      "The track failed to land in the top 50 in the US and only just managed in the UK, at 47. \"Her sort of spiritual 'let love lead the way' messages she posts don't really hold sway with very online pop fans in the face of that decision,\" says Cragg.",
      "\"The regressive girl boss feel of Woman's World, and then the album not being great hasn't helped,\" he adds, pointing to rapper Doja Cat's success working with Dr. Luke without the same negative response.",
      "It followed a pattern of failed reinvention attempts stretching back to 2017's Witness, where Perry attempted to launch her socially conscious \"purposeful pop\" era.",
      "But its Sia-written lead single Chained to the Rhythm, which boldly attacked mindless pop culture, appeared to be undermined by Bon Appetit, a song openly objectifying Perry as a sexual meal.",
      "The 'pop girlie' has changed",
      "Female pop stardom has shifted. Last year's biggest breakout music stars \u2013 Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX \u2013 were women joined by a thread of fierce self-assurance, underpinned by relatability and authenticity.",
      "In contrast, Perry wanted distance from her pop persona - as the headline for Cragg's 2017 Guardian interview with her put it: \"I created this character called Katy Perry. I didn't want to be Katheryn Hudson. It was too scary.\"",
      "Perry's first hit I Kissed A Girl caused controversy for the fetishisation of lesbians even back in 2008 when it was released. But today Roan's had global success telling her genuine queer awakening.",
      "\"The flip flopping has jarred in an era where... very defined pop star personas are the ones cutting through,\" argues Cragg.",
      "Perry's 2021-2023 playground-styled Las Vegas residency embraced her surreal, fantastical image to commercial and critical success.",
      "But it's not translating to a new generation of fans. \"I think ultimately people see her as a bit cringeworthy now,\" Cragg adds. \"Being shot into space on a billionaire's jolly while everyone watches that on social media platforms interspersed with war and the climate crisis... just feels tonally not ideal,\" he says.",
      "Perry may have misjudged the public mood, but at the same time, the venom in the blowback points to deeper issues in pop culture beyond her control.",
      "There is no doubt that the social media landscape has become more frenzied in recent years, with stars like Roan speaking against toxic fandoms.",
      "Simon Diego, the creator of Brazil's Portal Katy Perry fan community, described the scale of the abuse towards the 40-year-old as \"unbelievable\".",
      "The group showed their support by clubbing together with other fan pages to pay for a digital billboard message in New York's Times Square for 24 hours.",
      "\"We're so proud of you and your magical journey and we love you to the moon and back,\" it read.",
      "\"Know that you are safe, seen and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.\"",
      "It was this that Perry replied to directly with her Pi\u00f1ata remark acknowledging the backlash.",
      "\"I think Katy and many other celebrities are feeling unsafe in the one space that used to connect them to fans,\" Diego tells BBC News.",
      "He believes that's why Perry has never posted photos of her daughter's face online.",
      "But even that boundary was ignored in the wake of the spaceflight criticism, as commenters began targeting her four-year-old child simply because \"it's cool now\", he says. \"They don't understand how bad it could affect her.\"",
      "Others, like Marie Claire Australia editor Georgie McCourt, think pervasive misogyny plays a part.",
      "\"There's a particular ire reserved for women like Perry: ambitious, unapologetic, hyper-visible,\" she wrote in a column, noting that male celebrities have already gone into space without such surveillant reaction.",
      "So where next for Perry? Cragg says a hit single would help.",
      "\"I'm not saying it will return her to the commercial highs of old, because that ship has sailed for a lot of pre-streaming artists, but it will steady the ship.\"",

      "Whilst not all critic reviews have been favourable, the movie has been a hit with superhero fans - drawing in an impressive 95 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.",

      "Not all critics have not treated the film as favourably, with Empire's John Nugent noting that the film is \"missing a bit of colour - literally, in the washed-out palette and CG shadow-threat that dominates the latter half of the film \u2014 and figuratively, in its subject matter\".",
      "He adds that the topics covered, including suicide, depression and domestic violence are \"not always sensitively handled\".",
      "Radheyan Simonpillai at The Guardian gives the film three stars, citing that although the film is \"the best thing to come from the brand [Marvel] since WandaVision\", \"Thunderbolts often irritates because the depression and trauma the movie supposedly grapples with so often lives on the surface\".",
      "Simonpillai is full of praise for Pugh though, \"who can wrestle sincerity out of a screenplay (and a franchise) that has so little\".",
      "However, Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent looks on the film a little more favourably, giving it four stars and calling it \"the best Marvel movie in years\".",

      "\"I wanted to find some way of getting the female voice in this process, and the only way is the women who serve the meals, clean the rooms and run the hostel when the cardinals are there,\" he explains. \"I really wanted to make them a part of the story.\"",
      "Harris says that, while researching his novel about conclave, Pope Francis's office gave him permission to visit parts of the Vatican generally off-limits to outsiders.",
      "\"They showed me the most extraordinary things and allowed me to walk along the corridor to the balcony where the new Pope shows himself to the huge crowd in St Peter's Square,\" he recounts. \"That was a breathtaking moment.\"",

    "story": [
      "While most 13-year-olds were spending their Monday evening stressing over homework, awkward school crushes and what to post on TikTok, Blue Ivy Carter was performing in front of a crowd of 70,000 people alongside her mother Beyonc\u00e9 on the opening night of her Cowboy Carter tour.",
      "Her numerous cameos throughout the show \u2013 particularly her solo dance during D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu \u2013 were highly praised.",
      "\"She must be one of the most self-disciplined 13-year-olds in America,\" Variety's Chris Willman wrote. On social media, fans said the child prodigy was the \"greatest nepo baby of all time\" as they marvelled at her flawless dance routines.",
      "Being a nepo baby - shorthand for the children of celebrities who often find themselves fast-tracked into industries such as film, fashion, and music - may have been scorned at in the past, but Blue Ivy's performance may have complicated the narrative.",
      "The teen had access to a stage that most could only dream of, but she also delivered a performance that fans and critics agreed was very impressive, which raises the question: Is this just another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight, or could Blue Ivy be a genuine star in her own right?",
      "'An easier ride'",
      "This is also not the first time Blue Ivy has performed in public \u2013 she joined her mother on stage two years ago on the Renaissance tour and last year voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King.",
      "But music journalist Caroline Sullivan says Blue Ivy's trajectory to stardom \"has very little to do with her and everything to do with the parent\".",
      "\"It's about how much we like or dislike the parent \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is well liked so fans will praise Blue Ivy,\" she explains. \"Of course, it helps that she's good at what she does but even if she wasn't, she'd be given an easier ride.\"",
      "Sullivan also says that the authenticity of Blue Ivy wanting to perform instead of being forced to do it by her mother adds to how we perceive her.",
      "Speaking to the BBC last month, Beyonc\u00e9's mother, Tina Knowles, said Blue Ivy and her siblings were being nurtured to do \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed into show business\".",
      "She added that her granddaughter had had to \"work for\" her role in The Lion King prequel and she \"worries about the fame\" impacting her grandchildren.",
      "Blue Ivy is hardly the first child to have performed on stage with a famous parent. Madonna's 17-year-old daughter played the piano on her mother's Celebration tour in 2023, Dave Grohl's 19-year-old daughter has often sung with him on stage and Phil Collins' son was the drummer on his 2019 tour.",
      "\"It's not because he's the boss's son that he's playing the drums, it's because he's good enough,\" the former Genesis drummer said in 2019 as he defended his decision to take his 17-year-old son on his world tour.",
      "Sullivan says it can often be \"naff and cringy\" if a musician brings their child on stage \"just for the sake of it\", but if done right, it can be \"incredibly sweet and show a lot of love\".",
      "Many critics, including Tomas Mier from Rolling Stone, said Beyonc\u00e9's youngest daughter Rumi joining her on stage for Protector was \"one of the most heartwarming moments of the evening\".",
      "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's 11-year-old daughter, North West, has also forged the beginnings of a music career, recently delivering a rap verse in Japanese on FKA Twigs' single Childlike Things.",
      "Twigs said she chose to collaborate with North West because her \"energy is so inspiring\" and she was \"so confident\".",
      "\"I wasn't that confident when I was a kid. I was so shy, I was scared of the dark, I was very different to the other kids at my school. It suddenly occurred to me that I would have loved to have a friend like North, who could speak up for themselves.\"",
      "North West also appeared as Young Simba in the Hollywood Bowl's The Lion King 30th anniversary concert last year but her singing was criticised on social media.",
      "\"Given how controversial her parents are, I think North West will struggle to break away from the nepo baby claims because unless she is unbelievably talented, she will be slated,\" Sullivan says.",
      "In December 2022, New York magazine's cover story on nepo babies caused a stir in the showbusiness industry.",
      "The cover featured the faces of famous actors including Dakota Johnson, Jack Quaid, Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Lily Rose-Depp edited onto the bodies of babies, with the headline: \"She has her mother's eyes. And agent.\"",
      "The story claimed that \"a nepo baby is physical proof that meritocracy is a lie\" and that \"today, they're not only abundant - they're thriving\".",
      "It was met with backlash by many stars who claimed the label was unfair and diminished their hard work.",
      "Gwyneth Paltrow, a nepo baby herself as the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and film director Bruce Paltrow, said the term was an \"ugly moniker\" and that children of famous people should not be judged negatively because \"there's nothing wrong with doing or wanting to do what your parents do\".",
      "Similarly, Zoe Kravitz told GQ that it was \"completely normal for people to be in the family business\", while Stranger Things actress Maya Hawke said a famous family name \"definitely gives you massive advantages in this life but the chances will not be infinite; so you have to keep working and do a good job. If you do a bad job, the chances will stop\".",
      "Almost Famous star Kate Hudson, daughter of actors Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, said in a 2022 interview with the Independent that \"people call it whatever they want\", but the idea that children will follow in the footsteps of their parents is \"not going to change\".",
      "Hudson was right that, in the three years since New York magazine's cover story caused so much controversy, nepo babies haven't slunk off into the background. In fact, they continue to thrive, particularly those with real talent.",
      "Pam Lyddon, a PR executive in the entertainment industry says that there's \"no denying that being well-connected can absolutely help you succeed in the industry\" but \"while connections might get you noticed, you do still need genuine talent, hard work, and resilience to stay in the game - results speak for themselves and reputations are everything.\"",
      "She explains that for the new wave of nepo babies, talent is even more important as the \"scrutiny is more intense and people are more media savvy\" so you can't get away with mediocrity.",
      "As fans and critics continue to praise Blue Ivy, it seems that the credibility of nepo babies hasn't been damaged by the nepo baby backlash, and if you have the star factor, your parents being Beyonce and Jay-Z is only going to help you fly.",

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 23:43:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "Conclave to elect new pope to begin on 7 May, Vatican says",
      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants will be \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the imminent election may be one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

      "NHS Scotland will deliver an extra 100,000 appointments in GP surgeries in a bid to end the 08:00 \"lottery\", First Minister John Swinney has pledged.",
      "The SNP leader made the announcement as he unveiled his administration's programme for government 12 months ahead of the Holyrood election in May 2026.",
      "As well as putting the NHS \"at the heart\" of the legislative and policy agenda, Swinney announced his government would permanently ban peak rail fares and end an alcohol ban on ScotRail trains.",
      "The Conservatives said the statement was \"more of the same\" while Labour accused SNP ministers of wasting public funds after 18 years in power.",
      "The programme for government sets out the policy and legislative goals for the next parliamentary year.",
      "It is usually published after the summer recess, but Swinney moved the date this year to \"enable a full year to delivery\" before the Holyrood election.",
      "He told MSPs at Holyrood that his plans amounted to a \"programme for a better Scotland\".",
      "Swinney pledges 100,000 extra GP appointments to tackle '8am lottery'",
      "Peak rail fares to be scrapped by Scottish government",
      "Swinney acknowledged the difficulty many face in getting GP appointments can cause \"deep frustration\" in what he said was \"described as the 8am lottery\".",
      "He said the NHS would deliver an extra 100,000 appointments in GP surgeries focused on \"key risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and smoking\".",
      "It is understood GPs will be given extra funding to allow them to bring in people with conditions such as high blood pressure or cholesterol problems for check-ups before they are feeling unwell enough to ask to see a doctor.",
      "It is hoped this will help ease the demand for on-the-day appointments.",
      "The announcement, coming just nine months after the last programme for government, was light on proposed legislation.",
      "Swinney instead spent time emphasising his government's previous record.",
      "Among the concrete measures was a commitment to scrap peak rail fares on nationalised ScotRail trains.",
      "A previous pilot scheme was axed by the government last year, with ministers citing low passenger numbers.",
      "Swinney said the move would \"put more money in people's pockets and mean less CO2 is pumped into our skies\".",
      "Ministers also say they will end an alcohol ban on ScotRail trains, which has been in place since 2020.",
      "It is to be replaced by \"regulations that focus restrictions more effectively on particular times and locations, similar to previous restrictions\".",
      "Ahead of the announcement, Swinney faced questions on anti-social behaviour associated with a scheme giving everyone under the age of 22 a free bus pass.",
      "The government confirmed it was working on a scheme to suspend, or potentially permanently remove, passes from those engaging in anti-social behaviour.",
      "Swinney told MSPs child poverty and tackling cost-of-living pressures were also among his priorities.",
      "It came after figures released in March showed the Scottish government had missed its legal targets for reducing child poverty.",
      "The Scottish government announced in December that it would effectively offset the two-child benefit cap north of the border by April 2026, or earlier if possible.",
      "The cap, introduced by the UK government in 2017, prevents parents from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for more than two children, with a few exemptions.",
      "Swinney said his government was \"on track\" to deliver payments to affected families by next year.",
      "He said the government would publish a child poverty action plan for 2026 to 2031 \"to keep us on the journey to meet our poverty reduction targets for 2030\".",
      "To help stimulate the economy, the first minster announced a six-point export plan \"to enable Scottish exporters to diversify and grow markets\".",
      "He also said ministers would set up funds for research projects and start-ups.",
      "The SNP leader said the Scottish government would increase funding to the Acorn carbon capture project beyond a previous \u00a380m cap - if given the go-ahead by the UK government.",
      "The programme for government includes a commitment not to introduce new income tax bands, or increase current rates, before the next election.",
      "It also says ministers will bring forward a bill to regulate non-surgical procedures which are offered for \"cosmetic or lifestyle purposes\".",
      "Last week the Scottish government said it would not bring forward planned legislation to criminalise misogyny before next year's election - sparking criticism from the Scottish Greens.",
      "Ministers said there was not enough time to draw up a law which reflected the recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman, and instead planned to amend existing hate crime legislation to provide protections on the basis of sex.",
      "The government also confirmed it would not be bringing forward legislation to end conversion therapy this term.",
      "During his announcement, Swinney said the government was \"entirely committed\" to tackling misogyny.",
      "He also said his ministers would work with the UK government to deliver a conversion therapy ban across Scotland, England and Wales.",
      "'More of the same'",
      "Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay described the programme for government as \"flimsy\" and \"more of the same\".",
      "He told MSPs that it \"would do little to restore public trust\".",
      "Labour leader Anas Sarwar said billions of pounds of public money had been \"wasted by the SNP\" during its time in power, calling the announcement \"embarrassing\".",
      "He added: \"This statement fails to meet the challenges or ambitions of the people of Scotland.\"",
      "John Dickie, director of the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, said the government's plan \"lacks the scale and urgency needed to meet statutory targets never mind achieve the FM's ambition to eradicate child poverty altogether\".",
      "The Poverty Alliance said the policy agenda \"doesn't go far enough\", while the STUC described it as \"bold on rhetoric but light on details and on cash\".",

      "\"I didn't know what was happening and my parents didn't either,\" says the 15-year-old. \"It was scary. The attacks would occur without warning. It got worse and I began to have them in public.\"",
      "Lucy started missing a lot of school and stopped socialising. She says it was hard for her parents to see her struggling. \"We didn't know what to do or where to go.\"",
      "For six months, she tried to manage her anxiety herself, but eventually the family decided to pay for a talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy.",
      "Lucy says it has made a huge difference. While she still has panic attacks, they are much less frequent and she is back attending school and doing the things she enjoys.",
      "Lucy's story is far from unique. NHS figures suggest one in five children and young people aged eight to 25 has a probable mental health disorder.",
      "Why problems are so common",
      "The teenage years are when problems become increasingly common as young people grapple with the challenges of growing up, exam stresses, and friendships and relationships.",
      "There are biological reasons too that make emotional health problems more likely, says Prof Andrea Danese, an expert in child and adolescent psychiatry at King's College London.",
      "\"Teenagers' brains don't develop all at once. The part that processes emotions matures earlier than the part responsible for self-control and good judgement. This means young people can feel things very intensely before they've fully developed the ability to manage those feelings, which helps explain some of the emotional ups and downs parents often see.\"",

      "The most common problems teenagers experience are low mood and anxiety. For low mood, Prof Danese says, maintaining healthy routines around eating, sleeping, being active and keeping in touch with friends and family is important as is planning activities that your child enjoys, such as trips out or playing a sport.",
      "\"And help them identify, break down and try out solutions for problems that may have arisen,\" he adds.",
      "For anxiety, calming techniques are helpful, he says. These can include breathing exercises, grounding, whereby you concentrate on the environment around you and what you can see, touch and smell, and mindfulness activities.",
      "\"It's important to avoid the trap of providing unnecessary reassurance,\" Prof Danese says. Instead, alongside teaching calming techniques, parents should discuss and test out feared situations. \"To reduce worries, it can help to write them down or talk about them at a special 'worry time' once a day.\"",
      "Building resilience",
      "Stevie Goulding, who runs the parent helpline for Young Minds, says anxiety is the issue they get the most calls about.",
      "\"Many children will have bouts of anxiety and even panic attacks. It's difficult for parents. They can easily find themselves lacking in confidence and judgement about what to do. We get lots of calls from parents in that position. When they see their child struggling it can make them question themselves and they just don't know where to turn.",
      "\"The main advice we give parents is to communicate with their children. Give them permission to talk about what is bothering them \u2013 and if they don't want to talk to them, ask if there is someone else they would prefer to talk to.\"",

      "The number of assisted deaths could be more than 4,000 in the 10th year after the law comes into force in England and Wales if MPs vote for it, a review of the policy says.",
      "The estimate forms part of the official impact assessment, carried out by civil servants to inform MPs as they debate whether to allow assisted dying.",
      "It said initially the numbers coming forward would be low, but are expected to grow over time.",
      "The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029.",
      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"For me, assisted dying and giving people a choice at the end of their life when they are facing a terminal illness is about the human cost, it's not about pounds and pence.\"",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\"",
      "Leadbeater told Today the eligibility criteria under the bill was \"extremely strict\".",
      "She said: \"You have to be terminally ill. There are multiple layers of safeguarding built into the bill, including a multi-disciplinary panel of experts.",
      "\"So we are assessing mental capacity, we are checking for coercion at every level of this process to make sure that this is the clear and settled informed wish of the person who is terminally ill.\"",
      "She said that the bill was \"only about terminally ill adults who have less than six months to live\". \"The bill does not cover people with disabilities,\" she added.",

    "summary": "Why is the number of autism diagnoses changing? And what does it mean for autistic people?",
    "story": [
      "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.",
      "There's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.",
      "So what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?",
      "To count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.",
      "For someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.",
      "She says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.",
      "Restricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"",
      "The data",
      "But what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?",
      "Ms Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.",
      "They found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"",
      "And it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".",
      "But - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.",
      "Ms Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?",
      "Why are diagnoses rising?",
      "The definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.",
      "\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"",
      "But the definition was broadened, Professor Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.",
      "The eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.",
      "Another subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.",
      "Today, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.",
      "The autism net has been cast wider.",
      "Autism in women and girls",
      "One group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.",
      "Studies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.",
      "It's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.",
      "\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"",
      "Ms Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.",
      "She says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".",
      "Because autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).",
      "Now we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.",
      "She says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.",
      "More adults diagnosed",
      "The rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.",
      "\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"",
      "There's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.",
      "For Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.",
      "The 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"",
      "She says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"",

      "But others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.",
      "A focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".",
      "As the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.",
      "Environmental causes",
      "There's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.",
      "The internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.",
      "Disproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.",
      "But, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.",
      "Is there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?",
      "Ginny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.",

      "She also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".",
      "But Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.",
      "\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"",

      "Following the publication of an interim report, in March 2021, NHS England said it would increase spending on maternity care by \u00a395m a year.",
      "At the time, it said the money would be used to hire as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 consultant obstetricians.",
      "Some of the money was also to be spent on allowing consultants and midwives to train together - a key recommendation of the initial report, by senior midwife Donna Ockenden - as well as allocating money for the NHS to recruit from overseas.",

      "Before the EU summit, however, comes next week's immigration white paper - which will contain more detail of the government's plans to reduce legal migration and improve the asylum system.",

      "Referring to Gavin and Stacey, Morgan said what is right for Essex may not be right for Barry, the town that it was filmed in.",
      "She called for UK ministers to halt part of its plans to cut disability benefits, rethink cuts to the winter fuel allowance, and demanded Wales benefit more from wind power via the Crown Estate.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said there would not be a rethink on winter fuel cuts, but that the government needed to \"explain the decisions we've taken\".",
      "Meanwhile a poll published on Tuesday suggested that support for Labour among voters had fallen to a historic low.",
      "It comes after the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, introduced changes to personal independence payments (PIP) and cuts to health-related universal credit during the Spring Statement.",
      "Morgan told party members and politicians: \"It's nation and the people of Wales before party for me.\"",
      "The speech comes 12 months ahead of the next Senedd election, with Labour so far polling neck and neck with Plaid Cymru and Reform.",
      "The Welsh Conservatives said it was a \"last ditch, desperate attempt to save the Labour party's bacon\".",
      "Plaid Cymru said it was a \"desperate attempt by a floundering first minister to reset her premiership\".",
      "Reform, which is hoping to win its first seats in the Senedd next year, said Labour was \"more focused on slogans than solutions\".",
      "Is Welsh Labour turning away from Keir Starmer?",
      "I told No 10 of benefits concerns, Welsh FM says",
      "Speaking in Cardiff Bay, Morgan said she will not \"hesitate to challenge from within, even when that means shaking things up\".",
      "But using the analogy of the BBC sitcom, she said: \"There will be times when what's right for Essex is not right for Barry.",

      "\"Where we disagree, we will say it, where we see unfairness, we will stand up for it.\"",
      "She insisted that what she was describing was not a \"split\" but was instead \"grown up modern government\" and patriotic.",
      "Morgan used her speech to set out a list of requests of the UK government.",
      "She said the cuts in winter fuel payments was something that \"comes up time and time again, and I hope the UK government will rethink this policy\".",
      "Morgan called for Wales to benefit more from the Crown Estate, which is being used to build offshore wind projects off the coast of Wales.",
      "She argued that Wales should have control over the land in the same way the Scottish government does, which receives revenues from the Crown Estate north of the border.",
      "\"We saw them take our coal, we saw them take our water. We will not let them take our wind, not this time, not on my watch,\" she said.",
      "The first minister called for a shake-up to how her government is funded, saying the Barnett formula which determines how Wales is funded \"does not serve Wales well,\" she said.",
      "\"It needs to be changed to reflect the needs of our country, not the numbers of people who live here.\"",
      "She made the case for Wales to be \"at the front of the queue\" for rail investment, calling the HS2 classification as an England and Welsh project an \"almighty injustice\".",
      "In the speech Morgan stopped short of calling for cuts to disability benefit to be stopped.",
      "But in an interview with BBC Wales after the speech, Morgan said: \"I want certain parts of them certainly to be scrapped.",
      "\"What we'd like to see is them following some to the models that have worked for us in Wales - rather than it be about cuts, it should be about leading people, holding their hands through a process.",
      "\"Cutting someone's benefit is not going to push them into work.\"",
      "She added: \"I certainly think PIP has to be rethought. That is a significant problem for many of our communities.\"",
      "About 275,000 people of working age in Wales claim PIP and 150,000 claim the health-related element of universal credit.",
      "Morgan said disability cuts are likely to hit parts of Wales \"six times more proportionally in some areas of Wales, compared to England\".",
      "Morgan also used her speech to attack her rivals. She said Reform \"sow and reap grievance\", while Plaid Cymru \"promise a lot, but they expect someone else to foot the bill\".",
      "The rise of Reform and a split on the left meant that the \"whole shape of the future of Wales\" was at stake at the next election.",
      "Morgan said the Welsh government's \"red Welsh Labour way\" was working for the people of Wales, with free prescriptions, a cap on social care and high recycling rates.",
      "She said: \"I warn people in Wales, be careful not to take these things for granted.",
      "\"These are political choices that Welsh Labour has made and other parties can and will snatch them away from you.\"",

      "Earlier No10 said there would not be a reversal to winter fuel cuts, after calls for a rethink including from Eluned Morgan",
      "Starmer said his cabinet had discussed the election results when it met on Tuesday morning, repeating that \"it's really important that we indicate to voters that we get it\".",
      "He said the government would \"turbocharge\" it's change agenda \"so that people can feel it in their everyday lives.\"",
      "Starmer's press secretary said Eluned Morgan was \"absolutely right that Welsh Labour is in a unique position to deliver for Wales\".",
      "Asked about her comments on the winter fuel payment, he said: \"We won't agree on everything, but we are aligned in our mission to deliver security and renewal for working people.\"",

      "Labour has come first in every assembly and Senedd election since 1999.",
      "Dr Jac Larner, from Cardiff University's Welsh Governance Centre, said: \"This poll represents a substantial shift from previous Welsh polls and as always carries the health warnings of a single poll.",
      "\"However, the results support a broader pattern emerging throughout the UK - both Labour and Conservative parties are experiencing substantial erosion of support, though flowing in different directions, resulting in a newly fragmented four-party political landscape in Wales.\"",

      "\"It certainly doesn't make a single woman any safer to do that because the threat to women, as I think we all know, comes from predatory and abusive men.\"",

      "She urged ministers to \"urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way\".",

      "He added: \"One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world.\"",
      "Bell concurred that \"the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places\" and lower costs.",

      "The Tory leader told the BBC her party would \"come out fighting\" after losing 674 council seats and control of 16 authorities.",
      "But she cautioned against a knee-jerk response, saying the party's issues were \"not going to be fixed after six months\" of her leadership.",
      "She said: \"Reform had a good night. We had a bad night. And what this shows for a lot of people who hoped that just changing leader again would fix everything is that that's not going to be enough. We tried that previously. And that brought us to a historic defeat.\"",

      "Reform UK was the big winner, taking control of 10 councils and gaining 677 councillors, as the party seemed able to tap into widespread dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and Labour.",
      "The Lib Dems were the other standout winners, gaining 163 seats and control of three councils. They seized Shropshire from the Tories and gained control of Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire after both previously had no party in overall control.",

      "It won 677 of around 1,600 seats contested on Thursday across a clutch of mainly Tory-held councils last contested in 2021.",
      "Reform seized control of eight authorities from the Conservatives, including former strongholds Kent and Staffordshire.",
      "The party has also won control of Doncaster, the only council Labour was defending, and Durham, where Labour was previously the largest party.",

      "Reform takes Runcorn from Labour by just six votes",
      "'Not Labour enough': MPs' despair at voters' verdict on government",
      "As well as winning control of its first-ever councils, Reform has also won its first mayoral contests in the newly-created combined authorities of Greater Lincolnshire, and Hull and East Yorkshire.",
      "A jubilant Farage said the results meant Reform had overtaken the Tories as the main opposition party to Sir Keir Starmer's Labour government.",
      "The elections in 23 councils, across mainly rural and suburban areas of England, marked the first major electoral test since Labour's landslide general election victory last year.",
      "The Tories, who were defending the most seats, had been braced for big losses since the councils up for re-election were last contested in 2021, when the party was riding high under Boris Johnson during the Covid vaccine rollout.",
      "But their results have been even worse than expected, with the party losing over 676 seats and control of all the 16 authorities it was defending.",
      "It captured the Cambridgeshire & Peterborough mayoralty from Labour - a silver lining for the party in an otherwise dismal set of results.",
      "Reacting to the results in the Times on Saturday, Sir Keir said he shared in the \"sharp edge of fury\" felt by voters leaning away from the major parties, arguing that it spurs him on to \"go further and faster\" in delivering Labour's promised changes to public services, immigration and cost of living pressures.",

      "Writing for the Telegraph, she acknowledged the results had been a \"bloodbath\" for her party, but argued it had been \"making progress\" under her leadership, including on party unity and holding Labour ministers to account.",
      "Labour, which was defending far fewer seats this year, was down by 186 seats.",

      "The party seized Shropshire from the Tories, and gained control of Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire, two county councils where previously no party was in overall control.",
      "They have also become the biggest party in Hertfordshire and Wiltshire, as well as in Gloucestershire and Devon, where they narrowly fell short of overall majorities.",
      "The Greens gained over 40 seats, but will have been disappointed not to snatch the West of England mayoral contest from Labour, where they came a narrow third to Reform.",
      "The BBC is estimating that, if elections had taken place across Britain on Thursday, the Conservatives would have slumped to just 15% of the national vote, its worst-ever share of such a projection, behind the Liberal Democrats on 17%.",
      "Labour would have won 20% of the vote, according to the projection, equalling its lowest previous recorded performance in 2009.",
      "It is the first time the combined projected share of the vote for the Conservatives and Labour has fallen below 50%, underlining the continuing fragmentation of the British political landscape.",
      "Local beginnings",
      "Farage has made gaining a foothold in town halls a key staging post ahead of the next UK general election, which is expected in 2029.",
      "Before Thursday's elections it only had around 100 councillors, mainly as a result of defections from other parties.",
      "However, the results will also increase scrutiny of how his party performs in office and how it intends to wield its newly-acquired local powers.",
      "During the campaign, both the Reform UK and Tory leaders were repeatedly questioned during media interviews about how their local councillors might co-operate with each other after the elections.",
      "Farage ruled out striking formal coalitions with other parties to share power, but left the door open to more informal forms of co-operation, including the Conservatives.",
      "That position could soon be put to the test in councils including Leicestershire and Worcestershire, where it fell short of a majority despite becoming the largest party.",
      "Speaking to supporters on Friday, Farage said his party would seek to \"reduce excessive expenditure\" in local government, and suggested his councillors would scale back local diversity and climate policies.",
      "He added his party would also look to push back on asylum seekers being housed in hotels, saying he was opposed to the government \"plonking scores of young men\" in counties where his party now has control."

      "\"We can see that support for the Labour Party has collapsed within 10 months of them winning the general election,\" the Reform leader said.",

      "Nigel Huddleston, the co-chair of the Conservative Party, rejected Farage's claim that Reform were now the party of opposition as \"not credible\", pointing out that Reform now had five MPs to the Tories' 121.",
      "Reform also had success in the mayoral race, with former Conservative MP and minister Andrea Jenkyns, who defected to Reform last year, became both Greater Lincolnshire and the party's first mayor.",
      "She won with a majority of almost 40,000 over the Conservatives, and pledged Lincolnshire would be a \"blueprint\" for the way the party would run the country.",

    "story": [
      "When the UK became the first major economy in the world to commit to reducing its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, there was so little disagreement among MPs it was simply 'nodded through' without a vote.",
      "Six years on, the political climate is very different, the consensus at Westminster has shattered and reaching net zero is fast becoming a political dividing line.",
      "Labour has committed itself to an extra deadline: reaching clean power by 2030.",
      "The Greens and Liberal Democrats want to hit net zero faster, the Conservatives are slamming the brakes on their policy and, for the first time, there is now a mainstream party, Reform UK, openly questioning the need to reach net zero at all.",
      "Even a former Labour prime minister, Sir Tony Blair, has said that existing global approaches to tackling climate change aren't working (although it was later clarified that his institute supports the government's targets).",
      "So what's happened?",
      "Labour defends net-zero policies after Blair criticism",
      "Blair says current net zero policies 'doomed to fail'",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "In 2019, when the target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 was set, public concern about climate change was very visible.",
      "Thousands of people had joined Extinction Rebellion marches and the then-teenage activist Greta Thunberg was so influential she was invited to address MPs in Parliament.",
      "Luke Tryl, pollster for More in Common, says he has not found a significant drop in concern about climate change or support for net zero, even if we're not seeing people on the streets.",
      "What has changed, he says, is the conversation around it which, after the rising cost of living and the war in Ukraine, has switched to \"how does this reflect on people's pockets and does it make people think the country is safer as a result?\"",
      "He also says the debate has become \"more polarised between left and right\" with Labour and Lib Dem voters seeing it as a \"top three\" issue, while Reform voters are more opposed to net zero but less motivated by it: only one in 10 people vote Nigel Farage's party because of net zero, Tryl's research suggests.",
      "He also says that politicians are more divided than everyone else.",
      "\"The fracturing of the consensus has been far more profound at what we'd call 'elite level' rather than at public level,\" he says.",
      "Undoubtedly, part of the rise in the conversation about climate targets has been driven by the rise of Reform, which has made what it calls \"net stupid zero\" one of its major campaign issues.",
      "Deputy leader Richard Tice says his party - which has just won a by-election and made major gains in local elections - has forced the issue onto the political agenda.",
      "\"On the doors, people are talking about immigration but the next thing they talk about is the price of everything, the bills, the cost of living. When you drill into it, the message is getting across that the increase in the cost of living is significantly due to the increase in energy costs.",
      "\"The awareness of the stupidity of this has transformed in the last six months, because of the destruction of jobs and bills. People are waking up all over the place.\"",
      "For the Green Party of England and Wales Co-Leader, Adrian Ramsay, the fracturing of consensus is \"distressing\" and he blames party politics.",
      "\"There are parts of the political spectrum that are determined to turn this into a political football but I think reasonable people within all parties need to resist.\"",
      "He says people do need to feel they are included in climate measures and believes there is a \"sensible climate majority\" within Parliament, whose job it is to make the right policies to bring people along with them.",
      "\"Of course it has to be done in a way that brings people with us and there is a risk that there's too much onus put on individuals so when it comes to things like public transport, for instance....the greener option needs to be the cheaper option.\"",
      "There are also those that think the UK is starting to import the more partisan politics on the issue from the US.",
      "Pippa Heylings, the Liberal Democrats' net zero spokesperson, says she thinks part of the pushback is being driven by \"big oil and gas\" who, she says, have been \"emboldened by Donald Trump\".",
      "Another is that the easy things have already been done and \"we're now getting to the things that will touch on people's lives\".",
      "Her party's policy is currently to reach net zero by 2045 although she says they are looking at it to make sure it is still \"do-able\" after the previous Conservative administration shifted the government's timeline.",
      "The most marked political shift has come from the Conservatives, who have moved from setting the 2050 target, enthusiastically embracing green goals set by Boris Johnson, to a slowing of some targets under Rishi Sunak and, finally, abandoning 2050 under Kemi Badenoch.",
      "She has described the 2050 plans as \"impossible\" and said that what Keir Starmer needed to do was to \"scrap what [Energy Secretary] Ed Miliband is planning which is actually going to bankrupt the country\".",
      "\"It's not workable. Conservatives are working on new plans so that we can tackle climate change and look after our environment, without bankrupting the UK.\"",
      "Green-minded Tories have said they thought the decision to ditch the target was premature but they hope their party will recommit to decarbonisation.",
      "Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, said: \"On the centre-right there have been growing concerns around the cost of the transition and the shift to a more statist, interventionist approach to decarbonising.\"",
      "He says he wants to see a more \"market-led\" solution.",
      "While much of the Labour Party does seem to be on board with the leadership's position, there are some in the broader Labour movement who have issued warning shots that suggest their support for net zero is conditional.",
      "Some trade unions have become increasingly vocal about the need to ensure that there is a plan to protect jobs in any transition to green energy.",
      "As the union Unite put it: \"If they fail to do this, then Labour cannot expect workers to support their net zero plan.\"",
      "While the net zero by 2050 target is currently set in law, Labour's \"clean power by 2030\" push is self-imposed, leading to regular rumours that it could be watered down.",
      "Government sources are adamant the party is committed to it, and they point to investments that have already been made.",
      "Other Labour sources, who back the targets, say they believe the prime minister is invested in it and that it is intrinsically linked to the government's growth agenda.",
      "They also warn that any watering down of targets would shake confidence in foreign investment.",
      "Former Labour advisor John McTernan believes that keeping the clean power commitment is also key to the government's political survival beyond the next election.",
      "\"Labour has to be solid on it because it's a manifesto commitment and because it is a point of distinction with the parties on the right.",
      "\"If you're going to be picking up voters from the centre-left pool, you've got to have a proposition for them to vote for.\"",
      "He says the party won a big majority by promising \"big, difficult things\".",
      "\"It would be a dereliction of duty for the Labour party to win a landslide on difficult things and then go, 'do you know what, it's too difficult'.\"",
      "With so much political capital and economic hope riding on Labour's green agenda, pulling back from green targets could be fraught with danger.",

    "story": [
      "There is no doubt that Reform performed well in Thursday's local council elections. The party won most votes, most seats and overall control of most councils.",
      "True, the party's share of the votes cast across all 23 councils where elections took place on Thursday was no more than 31%. So despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting.",
      "However, its performance was enough to put Reform well ahead of the Conservatives \u2013 who traditionally dominate county councils - on 23%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and Labour on 14% when you tally up the votes in those parts of England that went to the polls on Thursday.",

      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "At the 2024 general election Reform secured 14% of the vote but just 5 out of 650 seats at Westminster. But crucially, being ahead of everyone else in 2025 ensured the first-past-the-post election system helped Reform.",
      "Its tally of 677 council seats represented 41% of all those being contested on Thursday, 10 points above its share of the vote, a nod to both the nature of the voting system and Reform's ability to cluster votes. That boost helped the party win control of as many as 10 councils, something that Reform's predecessor, UKIP, never managed at the height of its popularity in the run up to the 2015 general election.",
      "In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.",
      "Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first past the post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending.",
      "The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably.",
      "That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote.",
      "Brexit still a fault line",
      "Reflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.",
      "In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.",
      "Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.",
      "Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.",
      "The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.",
      "University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.",
      "Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.",
      "The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Chadsmoor in Staffordshire and Romney Marsh in Kent.",
      "Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.",
      "Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.",
      "Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.",
      "Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.",
      "In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain \u2013 places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.",
      "A problem for the two main parties",
      "Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.",
      "Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.",
      "The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.",
      "As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.",
      "In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.",
      "Liberal Democrat and Green wards \u2013 unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.",
      "Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.",
      "However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.",

      "The patchwork of different election results across England has been truly fascinating, throwing up all sorts of lessons.",
      "Here are seven things we have learnt from the contests:",
      "These are really bad results for the Labour Party",
      "Sometimes in politics what is most obvious is most important. These are a bad set of results for the Labour Party at their first electoral test since being swept to office ten months ago in a landslide of epic proportions.",
      "\"We did it!\" the prime minister told his jubilant supporters back then as seat after seat fell to Labour, adding: \"It feels good, I have to be honest.\"",
      "That's not so much the vibe these days.",
      "Leaving the eight-hour count after the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, Labour campaigners were utterly dejected, not least at having lost by only six votes, the closest result in any by-election ever.",
      "Yet even if they had won by six votes, the trend would have been the same -  a governing party which has burnt through goodwill at an unimaginable pace.",
      "It's possible to overstate how dramatic the contrast with the 2024 general election is, though.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's victory was broad but shallow, his 411 seats procured on just over a third of the vote. Perhaps it's not surprising that the so-called loveless landslide has been followed by a rude awakening.",
      "Labour's debate on what to do next is just beginning",
      "\"On every door it was the same story - winter fuel and Pip.\"",
      "That's what a Labour campaigner in Runcorn told me, referring to the early decision this government made to means-test the winter fuel allowance and the more recent announcement that eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment will be tightened.",
      "Speaking to Labour MPs from different wings of the party over the course of the day, it's been surprising how many have pretty much stuck to that same theme. For almost all of them, the original sin of this government was the decision on winter fuel.",
      "There are nuances within that position. Some believe the cut could have been communicated better, making the case that some pensioners were receiving the benefit who simply didn't need it. Others think it was never worth the political risk for the amount of money it would raise.",
      "To stress, it is not just the left of the Labour Party, comprised of a handful of MPs willing to criticise Starmer publicly, who are saying this. I had a conversation with an MP on the right of the party who believes the situation is so dire, the damage so fundamental, that Rachel Reeves should simply reverse the cut.",
      "That is extremely unlikely. But it is where the debate may be headed when MPs return to the Commons and compare notes next week.",
      "And of course a crucial part of that debate is the parlous economic situation inherited by the government which, those around the prime minister insist, necessitated unpleasant decisions which were always bound to be unpopular. If it had not been winter fuel, it would have been something else \u2013 the argument goes.",
      "The consolation of sorts for Labour is that fixing their political predicament is in their hands. They are the government and the levers of power are at their command. The next general election is up to four years away. All in Labour agree that people need to be made to feel better off - and they hope that if that can be achieved, the political challenges melt away.",
      "For the Conservatives, things are somehow getting worse",
      "Turns out the only way wasn't up. The Conservatives were reduced to their fewest MPs ever last July. That annihilation is now being visited on their local politicians.",
      "Kemi Badenoch took charge of a crushed Conservative Party and has only had six months to begin trying to turn things round. Still, I am yet to meet a Conservative who will sincerely argue that she has made a good start.",
      "I have, though, lost count of Conservative MPs and advisers who say to me that, in a funny way, they need Labour to be doing better. The Conservatives are still tarnished in many voters' eyes by their governing record, meaning that the receptacle for voters' immediate frustration with Labour, in Runcorn and elsewhere, is Reform UK.",
      "But it's more than just a story about the government's woes, as longstanding Conservative strongholds such as Staffordshire and Lincolnshire falling to Reform show. Some of the results simply need to be stated to see how startling they are.",
      "Conservatives had run Staffordshire County Council since 2009. They had 56 of the 62 councillors on Thursday morning. Now they have only 10.",
      "The Lib Dems have taken dozens of seats from the Tories. They have pushed the party into third place in this set of elections. Leader Sir Ed Davey is claiming to have seized the title of the party of \"Middle England\".",
      "There does not seem to be any appetite at all in the Conservative Party to even begin a conversation about changing leader yet again. Robert Jenrick throwing his support behind the woman who beat him to the leadership was a significant moment.",
      "Whoever is leader, a Conservative Party performing at this level is a Conservative Party in an existential crisis.",
      "'Not Labour enough': MPs' despair at voters' verdict on government",
      "Sir John Curtice: Reform challenging traditional party dominance",
      "For Reform, with victory comes responsibility",
      "It's hard to come up with the right superlatives for Nigel Farage's political achievement. Suffice to say the Reform surge evident in opinion polling has turned out to be real.",
      "Yes, under Farage's leadership Ukip won the European elections in 2014 and the Brexit Party did the same in 2019.",
      "Their success in five constituencies at the general election - including Farage himself finally making it into parliament at the eighth attempt - suggested Reform UK was something different to his previous incarnations. That is surely now proven beyond all reasonable doubt.",
      "Reform has now won control of ten councils, and with victory comes responsibility.",
      "When Ukip ran up victories in the European elections, its mandate was to scrutinise the Brussels institutions its voters loathed.",
      "Now its mandate is to make its own voters' lives better. That is a different task. The traditional main parties will be hoping that following responsibility comes accountability, and that if Reform councils and mayors fail, the party's brand will suffer.",
      "It's not just Reform benefitting from the main parties' unpopularity",
      "The Liberal Democrats have made solid gains across what was once traditional Tory territory, which is essentially local politics catching up with what happened at the general election last July.",
      "In Devon they gained 18 council seats, mostly at the Conservatives' expense, to become the largest party, and have won control of Oxfordshire, Shropshire and Cambridgeshire.",
      "They are ecstatic to have leapfrogged the Conservatives into third place in the BBC's Projected National Share.",
      "The Greens are making gains too, although their failure to win or even come second in the West of England mayoral contest will sting. The battle between the Greens and Labour for younger, urban progressives is likely to come to the fore in future local elections.",
      "Whoever is the change candidate wins",
      "Labour's general election slogan was just one word: change. No wonder that it appeared at the start of new MP Sarah Pochin's victory speech in Runcorn too.",
      "If there's one thing every politician and strategist from every party seems to agree on, it is that people are crying out for things to be better. In other words, for change.",
      "It was the mantle Keir Starmer managed to seize in opposition. His challenge is to reclaim it while being in government.",
      "The task facing each opposition party in their different ways is to stop him doing so and convince voters that they have the best shot of improving their lives.",

      "The era of fragmentation is here...at least for now",
      "The two-party double act which has governed Britain for a century appears to be under massive strain. It may be time to get used to elections in this country - parliamentary, mayoral, council - being won on low shares of the vote by very fine margins. Under our First Past The Post system (where the winner is simply the person with the most votes), if you have lots of parties with relatively even support, things can get really unpredictable.",
      "Yet if there's another lesson of British politics in recent years it's that politics is volatile. The death of the two-party system has been pronounced before. At the 2010 general election, Labour and the Conservatives only got 65% of the vote combined. By 2017 that figure was back up to 82%. In 2024 it was back to 57%. Things can change fast in politics - they have done, again and again.",
      "As politics begins to move at social media speed, who's to say Reform cannot fall away as fast as they rose?",
      "It's a counter-argument worth bearing in mind. On the other hand, it is no longer preposterous to say that Nigel Farage could be the next prime minister.",
      "The range of possible political futures which could unfold in the UK over the next few years is simply vast. Anyone who tells you what is going to happen next needs a whopping great dose of humility.",

      "Though some of the results are still to be reported, Reform are clearly the winners of Thursday's local elections.",
      "Across the 23 councils where a ballot was held, the party won more votes and more seats than any of its opponents by a clear margin. The party is probably heading for around 700 seat gains and won two mayoral contests.",
      "Meanwhile, it has won overall control of no less than seven councils, including the once Labour fiefdom of Durham and the two largest counties,  Kent and Lancashire.",
      "The party performed best in wards which voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 referendum. Yet even in places which voted to remain in the EU, the party was still routinely able to win as much as a fifth of the vote.",

      "Reform wins Runcorn by-election by just six votes and gains first mayor",
      "Reform wins Runcorn by-election by just six votes and gains first mayor",
      "In the BBC's projection of what would have happened if a nationwide election had been held on Thursday, Reform were credited with 30% of the vote. That easily beats the 23% that Ukip scored at the height of their popularity in 2013. It is the first time that a party other than Conservative or Labour has been placed first.",
      "Meanwhile, Reform also won the Runcorn by-election, albeit by the narrowest of margins. Never before has a pro-Brexit party candidate won a by-election, other than two local Tory MPs who defected to Ukip in 2014.",
      "For both the Conservatives and Labour the result was worse than their spokespersons feared. The Conservatives lost two in three of the seats they were defending and at best are likely to be left with control of just one council, Buckinghamshire.",
      "In a clear indication of the Conservatives' vulnerability to the challenge from Nigel Farage's party, its vote fell most heavily in places where the Reform advance was strongest. Their score in the BBC projection is by far a record low.",
      "Labour also lost two in three of the seats they were defending, though it had the consolation of winning three mayoral elections, albeit only by a narrow margin. Their projected share is the lowest since 2008, when the party suffered from the financial crash and the MPs' expenses scandal.",
      "In contrast, the Liberal Democrats were able to withstand the Reform tide, recording over 100 net gains. The party was particularly successful in councils that it had targeted, most notably Devon and Shropshire. Overall, however, the party's performance in votes was largely in line with that of other recent local elections. Much the same was true of the Greens, who made a modest gain of 38 seats.",
      "Before Thursday, commentators were asking whether the local elections would herald the end of Conservative and Labour's joint dominance of British politics. We certainly cannot rule out the possibility that this proves to be the case.",

      "In her victory speech, she declared it was a \"new dawn in British politics\" and vowed Reform would \"reset Britain to its glorious past\".",
      "She beat the Conservative candidate by more than 40,000 votes, which will feel like like a personal vindication for the former Tory MP.",

      "It all started in 2009, when she won a seat on Lincolnshire County Council, narrowly defeating the far-right British National Party's candidate.",
      "The result did not stand for long though. She was forced to resign after it emerged her part-time job as a music tutor for a council-run music service made her ineligible to run as a candidate.",
      "A by-election was held and Jenkyns squeaked home by 16 votes, again ahead of the BNP.",
      "Four years on, she lost her council seat to UKIP, a Eurosceptic party founded by Nigel Farage - Reform UK's leader and, ironically, now Dame Andrea's boss.",
      "Two years passed before her next comeback in 2015, when she burst onto the national scene with one of the biggest shocks of the general election that year.",
      "She ousted shadow chancellor Ed Balls, winning the Morley and Outwood constituency by 422 votes and knocking a brick out of Labour's red wall.",
      "Jenkyns - who worked at a Greggs bakery after leaving school at 16 - said she was \"lost for words\".",
      "In her campaign, she presented herself as a \"strong Yorkshire lass\" from humble beginnings.",
      "Born in Humberside in 1974, Jenkyns went straight into a job after finishing school, working her way up from a Saturday shop assistant to senior management.",
      "An amateur opera singer and a vocal coach, she also worked as a music tutor in secondary schools.",
      "When she hit her 30s, she decided to retrain and completed a diploma in economics from the Open University before graduating from the University of Lincoln aged 40 after studying international relations and politics.",
      "Her father was a lorry driver with his own haulage business.",
      "He pushed her towards the limelight at an early age, entering her in the Miss UK beauty contest.",
      "\"My dad sent my photo off without telling me and I ended up getting into the final,\" she told the Express newspaper.",
      "\"It was an interesting moment.\"",
      "Her father's death in 2011 - after he contracted the MRSA infection in hospital - spurred her to run for Parliament.",
      "Brexit backer",
      "As an MP, Jenkyns was a passionate Brexit backer and a strong critic of Theresa May's handling of the UK's departure from the EU when she was prime minister.",
      "In a striking intervention at Prime Minister's Questions, Jenkyns said May had \"failed to deliver on her promises\" and suggested she should resign.",
      "Once May had stood aside, Jenkyns found favour with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who appointed her as an assistant government whip in 2021 and a junior education minister a year later.",
      "A loyal ally, Jenkyns consistently defended Johnson, including during her appearance on the BBC's Have I Got News For You programme, when she described him as \"one of our better prime ministers\".",
      "When Johnson resigned in 2022, Jenkyns lost her composure outside Downing Street.",
      "She was filmed giving the middle finger to protesters shortly before Johnson's resignation.",
      "A backlash followed and in her defence, Jenkyns said she was \"only human\" and had received \"huge amounts of abuse from some of the people who were there over the years\".",
      "\"I responded and stood up for myself,\" she said.",
      "She was made a dame in Johnson's resignation honours in 2023.",
      "Jenkyns retained her ministerial role under Liz Truss but was later dismissed by the following prime minister, Rishi Sunak.",
      "She then failed to win re-election to the successor seat of Leeds South West and Morley at the 2024 general election.",
      "Bouncing back with Reform",
      "Back in the political wilderness, Jenkyns began flirting with Reform UK last year.",
      "Dame Andrea had made clear her sympathies with Nigel Farage's party, urging the Conservatives to unite with it to prevent a Labour \"supermajority\" at the general election.",
      "Attending Reform UK's conference last autumn, Dame Andrea insisted she was \"not defecting\" but was keen to find out whether Farage's party was \"the true home of conservatism\".",
      "Two months later, Jenkyns announced she was officially joining Reform UK and would stand as the party's candidate to be mayor of Greater Lincolnshire.",
      "Dame Andrea said she had \"fought to the bitter end\" but the Conservative Party was now \"beyond salvage\".",
      "Twelve years on from her defeat to Farage's former party in a local election in Lincolnshire, Jenkyns has delivered a significant electoral victory for her former foe.",

    "story": [
      "Is Welsh Labour facing a turning point as we approach a year to go until the Senedd election?",
      "Feelings behind the scenes that UK Labour does not get the fight that the party in Wales will face at the ballot box are starting to spill over.",
      "Whether they spill over into 'clear red water' - a phrase coined at the start of the century to describe how the Welsh party differentiated itself from its Westminster colleagues - remains to be seen.",
      "The First Minister, Eluned Morgan, told the Senedd on Tuesday that she will be making a speech next week to outline her position \"more clearly\" on the UK Labour government's welfare reforms \u2013 a controversial issue in Wales, where claimant levels are high.",
      "We do not know how far she will go, or whether she will dip her toe into other areas.",
      "She has plenty to choose from, with decisions made at Westminster affecting steel, welfare, rail funding, crown estate and National Insurance all proving controversial and very current issues.",
      "If she was minded to a year to go until an election, which takes place on 7 May 2026, seems as good a time as any for the first minister to deal with Westminster decisions which she worries might cost Welsh voters and cost her votes.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon BBC Wales saw a copy of a letter the FM has sent to the business secretary in Westminster outlining her concerns about the steel industry.",
      "Eluned Morgan is calling on Jonathan Reynolds to \"ringfence\" a significant amount of a \u00a32.5bn UK government steel fund for Wales.",
      "There are worries that the money will be used to keep the blast furnaces in Scunthorpe \u2013 rescued by the UK government \u2013 burning instead.",
      "The first minister had faced considerable flak during a debate on steel in the Senedd on Tuesday, under pressure from opposition parties and fielding concerns from her own MSs after Scunthorpe was rescued and Port Talbot's blast furnaces were not.",
      "Tata -the owners of Port Talbot \u2013 are investing in a joint venture with the UK government to build a new electric arc furnace there.",
      "The letter can be seen two ways \u2013 it makes the case for Wales' share of that funding, but also plays into what might be a narrative of the FM trying to differentiate herself from her colleagues in London, or stand up to them.",
      "FM says Scunthorpe steel help cannot be at expense of Wales",
      "FM criticises UK minister for saying she backs cuts",
      "First minister refuses to back welfare cuts",
      "Opposition parties are sceptical.",
      "They say it is too little too late and question how you can have a distance when the UK Labour-Welsh Labour relationship has been described as a \"partnership in power\".",
      "They have also been critical of what they see as a lack of influence that Welsh Labour wields.",
      "Some Labour MSs have already made their feelings clear on welfare reform.",
      "A minister \u2013 Jane Hutt \u2013 said that she had \"strongly\" complained about the \"adverse impact\" of the Westminster decision not to scrap the two-child limit for certain benefits.",
      "The first minister herself has made a veiled objection to comments from her Labour colleague, the Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens, that she had welcomed the reforms.",
      "When Eluned Morgan took over as FM last year a couple of her colleagues suggested to me that she might need a \"row\" \u2013 concocted or otherwise - with UK Labour, to bolster her position.",
      "When she makes her speech next week, will that time have come?",
      "If Morgan does sharpen up her language and criticism of UK Labour's approach, there would still be a risk for her.",
      "If she still does not get what she wants \u2013 especially with big decisions looming from the chancellor in the spending review in June \u2013 then where does she go from there?"

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0wjxg0ex1o",
    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 23:01:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Sir David says his new film Ocean is one of the most important of his career.",
    "story": [
      "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.",
      "He believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.",
      "Sir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"",
      "The ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.",
      "A blue carpet will be rolled out at the film's premiere tonight at the Royal Festival Hall.",
      "A host of celebrities are expected to attend including Chris Martin and Coldplay, Benedict Cumberbatch, astronaut Tim Peake, Geri Halliwell-Horner and Simon LeBon.",
      "Toby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.",
      "The film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.",
      "Sir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"",
      "Since then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.",
      "Ocean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.",
      "The new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.",
      "\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.",
      "The process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.",
      "Sir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".",
      "Sir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.",
      "It is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.",
      "Just one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"",
      "But in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.",
      "One of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"",
      "Despite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"",
      "Sir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.",
      "He believes that could be transformational.",
      "\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"",
      "A healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.",
      "\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.",
      "As he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.",

    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 06:29:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists hope to make a universal antivenom from the extraordinary blood of a man exposed to snake venom for decades.",
    "story": [
      "The blood of a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has led to an \"unparalleled\" antivenom, say scientists.",
      "Antibodies found in Tim Friede's blood have been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests.",
      "Current therapies have to match the specific species of venomous snake anyone has been bitten by.",
      "But Mr Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites - which kill up to 140,000 people a year and leave three times as many needing amputations or facing permanent disability.",
      "In total, Mr Friede has endured more than 200 bites and more than 700 injections of venom he prepared from some of the world's deadliest snakes, including multiple species of mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.",
      "He initially wanted to build up his immunity to protect himself when handling snakes, documenting his exploits on YouTube.",
      "But the former truck mechanic said that he had \"completely screwed up\" early on when two cobra bites in quick succession left him in a coma.",
      "\"I didn't want to die. I didn't want to lose a finger. I didn't want to miss work,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Mr Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for the rest of the world, explaining: \"It just became a lifestyle and I just kept pushing and pushing and pushing as hard as I could push - for the people who are 8,000 miles away from me who die from snakebite\".",
      "'I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'",
      "Antivenom is currently made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Their immune system fights the venom by producing antibodies and these are harvested to be used as a therapy.",
      "But venom and antivenom have to be closely matched because the toxins in a venomous bite vary from one species to another.",
      "There is even wide variety within the same species \u2013 antivenom made from snakes in India is less effective against the same species in Sri Lanka.",
      "A team of researchers began searching for a type of immune defence called broadly neutralising antibodies. Instead of targeting the part of a toxin that makes it unique, they target the parts that are common to entire classes of toxin.",
      "That's when Dr Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biotech company Centivax, came across Tim Friede.",
      "\"Immediately I was like 'if anybody in the world has developed these broadly neutralising antibodies, it's going to be him' and so I reached out,\" he said.",
      "\"The first call, I was like 'this might be awkward, but I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'.\"",
      "Mr Friede agreed and the work was given ethical approval because the study would only take blood, rather than giving him more venom.",
      "The research focused on elapids \u2013 one of the two families of venomous snakes \u2013 such as coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.",
      "Elapids primarily use neurotoxins in their venom, which paralyses their victim and is fatal when it stops the muscles needed to breathe.",
      "Researchers picked 19 elapids identified by the World Health Organization as being among the deadliest snakes on the planet. They then began scouring Mr Friede's blood for protective defences.",
      "Their work, detailed in the journal Cell, identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin. They added in a drug that targets a third to make their antivenom cocktail.",
      "In experiments on mice, the cocktail meant the animals survived fatal doses from 13 of the 19 species of venomous snake. They had partial protection against the remaining six.",
      "This is \"unparalleled\" breadth of protection, according to Dr Glanville, who said it \"likely covers a whole bunch of elapids for which there is no current antivenom\".",
      "The team is trying to refine the antibodies further and see if adding a fourth component could lead to total protection against elapid snake venom.",
      "The other class of snake \u2013 the vipers \u2013 rely more on haemotoxins, which attack the blood, rather than neurotoxins. In total there are around a dozen broad classes of toxin in snake venom, which also includes cytotoxins that directly kill cells.",
      "\"I think in the next 10 or 15 years we'll have something effective against each one of those toxin classes,\" said Prof Peter Kwong, one of the researchers at Columbia University.",
      "And the hunt continues inside Mr Friede's blood samples.",
      "\"Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,\" said Prof Kwong.",
      "The ultimate hope is to have either a single antivenom that can do everything, or one injection for elapids and one for vipers.",
      "Prof Nick Casewell, who is the head of the centre for snakebite research and interventions at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said the breadth of protection reported was \"certainly novel\" and provided \"a strong piece of evidence\" that this was a feasible approach.",
      "\"There is no doubt that this work moves the field forwards in an exciting direction.\"",
      "But he cautioned there was \"much work to do\" and that the antivenom still needed extensive testing before it could be used in people.",
      "But for Mr Friede, reaching this stage \"makes me feel good\".",
      "\"I'm doing something good for humanity and that was very important to me. I'm proud of it. It's pretty cool.\""

      "A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild.",
      "Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction.",
      "But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.",
      "It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge.",
      "This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany.",
      "Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.",
      "\"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\"",
      "Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.",
      "Though not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food.",
      "Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction.",
      "\"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.",
      "It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx.",
      "The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring.",
      "\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.",
      "To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind.",
      "But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.",
      "So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.",
      "\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo.",
      "Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.",
      "\"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told us.",
      "We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills.",
      "There are puncture marks on its throat \u2013 a sure sign.",
      "\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.",
      "The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.",
      "\"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure.",

      "The insects are most often spotted in woodland areas, particularly pine forests in the east, though they are often found inland in our biggest cities. In Glasgow larvae was found floating in stagnant water such as garden plant pots and ponds.",
      "Heather Ferguson, professor of medical entomology at the University of Glasgow, described the initial response to their three-year long project as \"tremendous\".",
      "She said: 'We found them to a much greater extent than we've known before.",
      "\"In almost all parts of the country we got reports of different species. And a very exciting first for us, we found the most northernmost record for the UK when we had a member of the public in Shetland report a mosquito which we were able to confirm.\"",
      "In addition to the public sightings, the team hung traps at 24 locations across the country, luring the insects by the smell of carbon dioxide which mimics human breath.",
      "Dr Georgia Kirby leads the citizen science project and said public reporting has guided where they hang the traps, which can sometimes catch more than 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days.",
      "She said: \"There were several areas of Scotland where we received lots of reports of bites but very few photos of the culprits \u2013 understandably, as most people don't want to hold still for a photo while they're being bitten by insects.",
      "\"We had suspected that midges or clegs could be responsible, but in our follow-up investigations we invariably found that these locations were swarming with mosquitoes \u2013 proving that people in Scotland are good at recognising them and distinguishing them from more familiar insects.",
      "\"Most of these sites were areas of dense woodland, which is a key habitat for several aggressive human-biting mosquito species.\"",
      "Is malaria a risk?",
      "Mosquitoes don't currently pose a health risk to humans in Scotland. The parasite needed to spread infectious disease like malaria is not present here.",
      "However, it was a different story 200 years ago when malaria was common in the UK.",
      "It was present in the east of Scotland in particular and spread by native mosquitoes.",
      "Today, climate change is likely to mean we could see more mosquitoes in Scotland, as our climate becomes warmer and wetter - perfect conditions to allow them to thrive.",
      "Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, has been found to carry and transmit the Usutu virus, originally discovered in the 1950s in Africa and present in Europe for the past three decades.",
      "The virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and has affected blackbird populations.",
      "The Mosquito Scotland project will continue to help track their population and scientists say it will help provide a crucial early warning system for potential risk, as the species respond to environmental change.",
      "Professor Ferguson and Dr Kirby want to hear more from the public in 2025, to help increase their knowledge and build a picture of the biodiversity benefits of mosquitoes and any potential risks.",

      "A challenge to Britain's ban on commercial fishing for sandeels in the North Sea has been dismissed in an international court.",
      "Sandeels are a vital source of food for marine life including seabirds that live along the UK coastline.",
      "Two bans for English and Scottish waters were put in place in early 2024 to prohibit trawlers netting the tiny fish, following concerns that sandeel stocks were becoming too low.",
      "Judges at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) based in The Hague ruled there is no legal obligation to reverse the closure order after the EU claimed the move was \"discriminatory and disproportionate\", and could threaten the future of commercial sandeel fishing in Denmark.",
      "The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which manages Bempton Cliffs in East Yorkshire, was one of several conservation organisations that called for the measure to remain in place and gave evidence in the court hearing.",
      "Beccy Speight, the RSPB's chief executive, said: \"We are absolutely delighted the panel has found the ecological case for the closure of industrial sandeel fishing is sound.\"",
      "\"Safeguarding sandeel stocks is a key part of the jigsaw that will help set our puffins, kittiwakes and the wider marine environment on the path to recovery.\"",
      "The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) welcomed the court's decision and said it had found \"the UK successfully demonstrated that the measures taken to close English and Scottish waters were based on the best available science\".",
      "Sandeels comprise a number of species of small fish and are caught commercially for use in animal feed and in oil production.",
      "Danish fishing organisations had argued that the North Sea ban was \"unnecessary\" and claimed sandeel stocks were plentiful, disputing the scientific evidence.",
      "Speaking before the court ruling Esben Sverdrup-Jensen, from the Danish Pelagic Producers' Association, said the ban had a \"massive impact\" on the industry.",
      "\"It means we have lost about half of the fishing grounds that we have traditionally fished on for decades,\" he said.",
      "Mr Sverdrup-Jensen disputed the claim that sandeel stocks were under threat.",
      "\"Sandeel is probably the best managed fishery in the world,\" he added.",
      "The ruling means a sandeel fishing ban also remains in place in the Scottish areas of the North Sea and this has been welcomed by the Scottish government, which has continuing concerns about the seabird population.",
      "Scotland's Rural Affairs Secretary, Mairi Gougeon, said: \"Protecting our marine ecosystem is vital to Scotland's environment, and to the people and communities who rely on it.",
      "\"The ruling reaffirms the appropriateness of the actions we took last year to do just that.\"",
      "The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling, which runs to nearly 300 pages, also stated the ban in English waters breached the post-Brexit trade deal because it was \"disproportionate\".",
      "In a statement, the European Commission said it welcomed the ruling as it \"provides clarity\" on fishing rights.",
      "It said: \"The UK is required to immediately comply with the final ruling and shall inform the EU within 30 days of the [compliance] measures it will take\".",
      "A Defra spokesperson said it would \"bring the UK into compliance\" on this issue but the ruling did not mean the UK is legally obliged to reverse the closure of English waters.",

    "story": [
      "One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered.",
      "In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City.",
      "The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they \"survived and foraged successfully at both sites\" - even gaining weight.",
      "Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an \"amazing result\".",
      "The findings are published in the journal PLoS One and they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat.",
      "The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians.",
      "But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild.",
      "\"If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,\" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.",
      "It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.",
      "\"If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"",
      "To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland \"refuges\" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water,",
      "The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an \"artificial wetland\".",
      "Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device.",
      "\"The amazing news is that they all survived,\" Dr Ramos told BBC News. \"And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.\"",
      "The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. \"We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,\" Dr Ramos explained.",
      "Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically.",
      "But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover.",
      "\"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people.",
      "\"You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.\""

    "summary": "Sir David says his new film Ocean is one of the most important of his career.",
    "story": [
      "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.",
      "He believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.",
      "Sir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"",
      "The ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.",
      "A blue carpet will be rolled out at the film's premiere tonight at the Royal Festival Hall.",
      "A host of celebrities are expected to attend including Chris Martin and Coldplay, Benedict Cumberbatch, astronaut Tim Peake, Geri Halliwell-Horner and Simon LeBon.",
      "Toby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.",
      "The film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.",
      "Sir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"",
      "Since then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.",
      "Ocean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.",
      "The new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.",
      "\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.",
      "The process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.",
      "Sir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".",
      "Sir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.",
      "It is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.",
      "Just one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"",
      "But in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.",
      "One of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"",
      "Despite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"",
      "Sir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.",
      "He believes that could be transformational.",
      "\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"",
      "A healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.",
      "\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.",

      "When the UK became the first major economy in the world to commit to reducing its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, there was so little disagreement among MPs it was simply 'nodded through' without a vote.",
      "Six years on, the political climate is very different, the consensus at Westminster has shattered and reaching net zero is fast becoming a political dividing line.",
      "Labour has committed itself to an extra deadline: reaching clean power by 2030.",
      "The Greens and Liberal Democrats want to hit net zero faster, the Conservatives are slamming the brakes on their policy and, for the first time, there is now a mainstream party, Reform UK, openly questioning the need to reach net zero at all.",
      "Even a former Labour prime minister, Sir Tony Blair, has said that existing global approaches to tackling climate change aren't working (although it was later clarified that his institute supports the government's targets).",
      "So what's happened?",
      "Labour defends net-zero policies after Blair criticism",
      "Blair says current net zero policies 'doomed to fail'",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "In 2019, when the target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 was set, public concern about climate change was very visible.",
      "Thousands of people had joined Extinction Rebellion marches and the then-teenage activist Greta Thunberg was so influential she was invited to address MPs in Parliament.",
      "Luke Tryl, pollster for More in Common, says he has not found a significant drop in concern about climate change or support for net zero, even if we're not seeing people on the streets.",
      "What has changed, he says, is the conversation around it which, after the rising cost of living and the war in Ukraine, has switched to \"how does this reflect on people's pockets and does it make people think the country is safer as a result?\"",
      "He also says the debate has become \"more polarised between left and right\" with Labour and Lib Dem voters seeing it as a \"top three\" issue, while Reform voters are more opposed to net zero but less motivated by it: only one in 10 people vote Nigel Farage's party because of net zero, Tryl's research suggests.",
      "He also says that politicians are more divided than everyone else.",
      "\"The fracturing of the consensus has been far more profound at what we'd call 'elite level' rather than at public level,\" he says.",
      "Undoubtedly, part of the rise in the conversation about climate targets has been driven by the rise of Reform, which has made what it calls \"net stupid zero\" one of its major campaign issues.",
      "Deputy leader Richard Tice says his party - which has just won a by-election and made major gains in local elections - has forced the issue onto the political agenda.",
      "\"On the doors, people are talking about immigration but the next thing they talk about is the price of everything, the bills, the cost of living. When you drill into it, the message is getting across that the increase in the cost of living is significantly due to the increase in energy costs.",
      "\"The awareness of the stupidity of this has transformed in the last six months, because of the destruction of jobs and bills. People are waking up all over the place.\"",
      "For the Green Party of England and Wales Co-Leader, Adrian Ramsay, the fracturing of consensus is \"distressing\" and he blames party politics.",
      "\"There are parts of the political spectrum that are determined to turn this into a political football but I think reasonable people within all parties need to resist.\"",
      "He says people do need to feel they are included in climate measures and believes there is a \"sensible climate majority\" within Parliament, whose job it is to make the right policies to bring people along with them.",
      "\"Of course it has to be done in a way that brings people with us and there is a risk that there's too much onus put on individuals so when it comes to things like public transport, for instance....the greener option needs to be the cheaper option.\"",
      "There are also those that think the UK is starting to import the more partisan politics on the issue from the US.",
      "Pippa Heylings, the Liberal Democrats' net zero spokesperson, says she thinks part of the pushback is being driven by \"big oil and gas\" who, she says, have been \"emboldened by Donald Trump\".",
      "Another is that the easy things have already been done and \"we're now getting to the things that will touch on people's lives\".",
      "Her party's policy is currently to reach net zero by 2045 although she says they are looking at it to make sure it is still \"do-able\" after the previous Conservative administration shifted the government's timeline.",
      "The most marked political shift has come from the Conservatives, who have moved from setting the 2050 target, enthusiastically embracing green goals set by Boris Johnson, to a slowing of some targets under Rishi Sunak and, finally, abandoning 2050 under Kemi Badenoch.",
      "She has described the 2050 plans as \"impossible\" and said that what Keir Starmer needed to do was to \"scrap what [Energy Secretary] Ed Miliband is planning which is actually going to bankrupt the country\".",
      "\"It's not workable. Conservatives are working on new plans so that we can tackle climate change and look after our environment, without bankrupting the UK.\"",

      "While much of the Labour Party does seem to be on board with the leadership's position, there are some in the broader Labour movement who have issued warning shots that suggest their support for net zero is conditional.",
      "Some trade unions have become increasingly vocal about the need to ensure that there is a plan to protect jobs in any transition to green energy.",
      "As the union Unite put it: \"If they fail to do this, then Labour cannot expect workers to support their net zero plan.\"",
      "While the net zero by 2050 target is currently set in law, Labour's \"clean power by 2030\" push is self-imposed, leading to regular rumours that it could be watered down.",
      "Government sources are adamant the party is committed to it, and they point to investments that have already been made.",
      "Other Labour sources, who back the targets, say they believe the prime minister is invested in it and that it is intrinsically linked to the government's growth agenda.",
      "They also warn that any watering down of targets would shake confidence in foreign investment.",

      "Mr Altman had put forward a similar plan in December - but without clarifying the control of the non-profit.",
      "The update follows widespread scrutiny of the startup, which began as a non-profit and faced criticism, including from co-founder Elon Musk, that its quest for growth is pushing it to stray from its original mission of creating technology for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Last month, a group of former open AI staff and outside experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, wrote to regulators in California and Delaware, which have power over non-profits, asking them to intervene to block the conversion.",
      "OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor said the start-up made the decision \"after hearing from civic leaders and engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorney General of Delaware and the Attorney General of California\".",
      "In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said the non-profit would continue to control OpenAI, receiving a \"big\", yet-to-be determined stake in OpenAI's business arm, which would give it access to money to put towards its own goals.",
      "He said the new plan would still allow the organisation to stop operating under its current complex governance structure, which had capped its profits.",
      "That was seen as a sticking point for investors, including Microsoft, that hindered the firm's ability to raise money.",
      "\"We are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock,\" he wrote in a letter to staff that was shared on the OpenAI website. \"This is not a sale, but a change of structure to something simpler.\"",
      "Unlike traditional for-profit companies, which are bound to act in service to shareholders, a public benefit corporation is also responsible for a public mission.",
      "In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said he believed that growth and extending access to AI, which would take money, was consistent with the firm's mission, because it would help people \"build incredible things for each other and continue to drive society and quality of life forward\".",
      "\"It will of course not be all used for good, but we trust humanity and think the good will outweigh the bad by orders of magnitude,\" he wrote.",

    "summary": "The conservative leader is sworn in, having won a parliament vote to become chancellor at the second attempt.",
    "story": [
      "Conservative leader Friedrich Merz has won a parliament vote to become Germany's next chancellor at the second attempt.",
      "Merz had initially fallen six votes short of the absolute majority he needed on Tuesday morning - a significant blow to his prestige and an unprecedented failure in post-war German history.",
      "As it was a secret ballot in the 630-seat Bundestag, there was no indication who had refused to back him - whether MPs from his centre-left coalition partner or his own conservatives.",
      "After hours of uncertainty in the Bundestag, the parties and the president of the Bundestag agreed to hold a second vote, which Merz then won with 325 votes, a majority of nine.",
      "His coalition with the Social Democrats should have had enough seats in parliament from the start, with 328 MPs in total, but it is thought 18 of them dissented during the first vote.",
      "No chancellor candidate has lost a Bundestag vote in the 76 years since democracy was restored in Germany in 1949, and there was a prevailing mood of confusion in parliament in the hours after the vote.",
      "Under Germany's constitution, there is no limit to how many votes can be held but in practice another defeat for Merz would have meant a headache for his Christian Democrats, its sister party the Christian Social Union and their partner the Social Democrats.",
      "The result meant a total debacle had been averted, declared one German news website.",
      "Merz, 69, was then sworn in as chancellor by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and his team of 17 ministers were due to take office.",
      "Bundestag President Julia Kl\u00f6ckner had originally been planning a follow-up vote on Wednesday, but Christian Democrat General Secretary Carsten Linnemann said it was important to press ahead.",
      "\"Europe needs a strong Germany, that's why we can't wait for days,\" he told German TV.",
      "Parliamentary group leader Jens Spahn appealed to his colleagues' sense of responsibility: \"All of Europe, perhaps the whole world, is watching this ballot.\"",
      "Merz's defeat had been seen by political commentators as a humiliation, possibly inflicted by a handful of disaffected members of the Social Democrat SPD, which signed a coalition deal with his conservatives on Monday.",
      "The Bundestag president told MPs that nine of the 630 MPs had been absent for the first vote while three had abstained and another ballot paper had been declared invalid.",
      "Germany's new Europe Minister, Gunther Krichbaum, told the BBC that some MPs may have hoped for a ministerial or state secretary role and had their hopes dashed. He also pointed out that some young Social Democrats had publicly said they were not convinced by Merz.",
      "However, SPD officials were adamant their party was fully committed to the coalition deal.",
      "\"It was a secret vote so nobody knows,\" senior Social Democrat MP Ralf Stegner told the BBC, \"but I can tell you I don't have the slightest impression that our parliamentary group wouldn't have known our responsibility.\"",
      "Krichbaum, a conservative, said the clear message was that \"now we are today in the situation to create a stable government\" to tackle Germany's big issues, including migration and the economy.",
      "Far-right party Alternative for Germany, which came second in the February election with 20.8% of the vote, seized on Merz's initial failure and called for fresh elections.",
      "Joint leader Alice Weidel wrote on X that the vote showed \"the weak foundation on which the small coalition has been built between the [conservatives] and SPD, which was rejected by voters\".",
      "Merz's choice for foreign minister, Christian Democrat colleague Johann Wadephul, told the BBC the initial vote was \"an obstacle but not a catastrophe\".",
      "Germany's handover of government is carefully choreographed. On the eve of Tuesday's vote, outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz was treated to a traditional Grand Tattoo by an armed forces orchestra.",
      "Merz had then been expected to sail through the initial vote on Tuesday morning, fulfilling a long-held ambition to become German chancellor.",
      "His rival and former chancellor Angela Merkel had come to the Bundestag to watch the vote take place. She was not present for the second vote.",
      "Among the first international leaders to congratulate Germany's conservative leader was Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, who hoped that Germany would \"grow even stronger and that we'll see more German leadership in European and transatlantic affairs\".",
      "Political correspondents in the Bundestag said Merz's initial shock result indicated he had a potential problem lurking within his coalition ranks.",
      "AfD MP Bernd Baumann said the CDU had promised a string of policies similar to his own party's, such as limiting migration, and had then gone into an alliance with the centre left: \"That doesn't work. That's not how democracy works.\"",
      "\"This isn't good,\" warned Green politician Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt. \"Even though I don't want this chancellor or support him, I can only warn everyone not to rejoice in chaos.\"",
      "Barely 24 hours earlier, the messaging from Merz had been very different, of a new, stable government bringing six months of political paralysis to an end.",
      "\"It's our historical duty to make this government a success,\" he had said as he signed the coalition document on Monday.",
      "Despite having a narrow majority of 12 seats, the agreement between the conservatives and centre left was seen as far more secure than the so-called traffic-light coalition of three parties that fell apart last November in a row over debt spending.",
      "The SPD, which had been the biggest party in the old coalition slumped to its worst post-war election result in third place, but Merz had promised that Germany was back and that he would boost its voice on the world stage and revive a flagging economy.",
      "After two years of recession, Europe's largest economy grew in the first three months of 2025. However economists have warned of potential risks to German exports because of US-imposed tariffs.",
      "Germany's services sector contracted last month because of weaker demand and lower consumer spending."

      "Israel also intends to replace the current aid delivery and distribution system with one channelled through private companies and military hubs.",

    "summary": "Delhi has called the sale of the jewels illegal and demanded for them to be repatriated to India.",
    "story": [
      "The Indian government has threatened to take legal action against Sotheby's in Hong Kong unless they stop an upcoming auction of jewels linked to the Buddha's remains and requested their return to India.",
      "The auction, which is set to take place on Wednesday, includes gems which were found buried with Buddha's bone fragments more than a hundred years ago.",
      "India's ministry of culture has said the sale \"violates Indian and international laws as well as UN conventions\", and asked for the jewels should be treated as sacred. The sale has also been condemned by several Buddhists and art scholars globally.",
      "Sotheby's has told the BBC the auction will proceed as planned.",
      "The Indian ministry posted a letter it sent to Sotheby's and Chris Pepp\u00e9, the great-grandson of William Claxton Pepp\u00e9, who excavated the relics in 1898, on Instagram.",
      "The post stated that Sotheby's has responded to the legal notice and assured that the matter is receiving its \"full attention\".",
      "The post said that Pepp\u00e9 \"lacks authority\" to sell the relics and accused the auction house of participating in \"continued colonial exploitation\" by facilitating the sale.",

      "Jewels linked to Buddha remains go to auction, sparking ethical debate",
      "William Claxton Pepp\u00e9 was an English estate manager who excavated a stupa at Piprahwa, just south of Lumbini, the believed birthplace of Buddha. He uncovered relics inscribed and consecrated nearly 2,000 years ago.",
      "The findings included nearly 1,800 gems, including rubies, topaz, sapphires and patterned gold sheets, stored inside a brick chamber. This site is now in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.",
      "William Pepp\u00e9 handed the gems, relics and reliquaries to the colonial Indian government, from where the bone relics went to the Buddhist King of Siam (Rama V). Five relic urns, a stone chest and most other relics were sent to the Indian Museum in Kolkata - then the Imperial Museum of Calcutta.",
      "Only a small \"portion of duplicates\", which he was allowed to keep, remained in the Pepp\u00e9 family, Chris Pepp\u00e9 said. (Sotheby's notes say Pepp\u00e9 was allowed to keep approximately one-fifth of the discovery.)",
      "The Indian ministry has said that labelling the jewels as \"duplicates\" is misleading and that these relics make up the \"inalienable religious and cultural heritage\" of India.",
      "The jewels \"cannot be treated as specimens\" but as the \"sacred body and originally interred offerings to the sacred body\" of the Buddha, the post said.",
      "The ministry has also questioned the custodianship of the jewels.",
      "It said that the sellers who call themselves the custodians of the gems do not have the right to \"alienate or misappropriate the asset\", which it calls an \"extraordinary heritage of humanity\".",
      "The statement also mentioned a decade-old report which said that the relics were left forgotten in a shoebox, suggesting that custodianship also included \"safe upkeep\".",
      "The Indian ministry has demanded a public apology from Sotheby's and Pepp\u00e9. It has also asked them to fully disclose all records that trace the ownership of the relics that are still in their possession or transferred by them.",
      "The ministry has said that the failure to comply with their demands would lead to legal proceedings in India and Hong Kong for \"violation of cultural heritage law\".",
      "It also threatened to launch a \"public campaign\" highlighting Sotheby's role in perpetuating \"colonial injustice\".",
      "Earlier, Chris Pepp\u00e9 had told the BBC that the the family looked into donating the relics, but all options presented problems and an auction seemed the \"fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists\".",
      "Chris Pepp\u00e9 has written that the jewels passed from his great-uncle to his cousin, and in 2013 came to him and two other cousins.",
      "Over the past six years years, the gems have featured in major exhibitions, including one at The Met in 2023. The Pepp\u00e9 family has also launched a website to \"share our research\".",
      "But the Indian ministry in its statement said custodianship of the jewels has been \"monetised via publicity and exhibition\".",

    "summary": "A Catholic priest abused Alexa MacPherson for six years. Did Pope Francis do enough on child abuse?",
    "story": [
      "As 133 cardinals meet in Rome to decide the next pope, questions about the legacy of the last one will loom large over their discussions.",
      "For the Catholic Church, no aspect of Pope Francis' record is more sensitive or contentious than his handling of the sexual abuse of children by members of the clergy.",
      "While he's widely considered to have gone further than his predecessors in acknowledging victims and reforming the Church's own internal procedures, many survivors do not think he went far enough.",
      "Alexa MacPherson's abuse by a Catholic priest began around the age of three and continued for six years.",
      "\"When I was nine-and-a-half, my father caught him trying to rape me on the living room couch,\" she told me when we met on the Boston waterfront.",
      "\"For me, it was pretty much an everyday occurrence.\"",
      "On discovering the abuse, her father called the police.",
      "A court hearing for a criminal complaint against the priest, Peter Kanchong, accused of assault and battery of a minor, was set for 24 August 1984.",
      "But unbeknownst to the family, something extraordinary was taking place behind the scenes.",
      "The Church \u2013 an institution that wielded enormous power in a deeply Catholic city \u2013 believed that the court was on its side.",
      "\"The court is attempting to handle the matter in such a way as to help Father Peter and to avoid scandal to the Church,\" the then-Archbishop of Boston, Bernard Law, wrote in a letter that would remain hidden for years.",
      "Reflecting on the events of more than four decades ago, Ms MacPherson recognises that her abuse took place long before Francis became pope.",
      "But over that same period, through a series of global scandals which are still unfolding, the issue of the systemic sexual exploitation of children has become the modern Church's biggest challenge.",
      "It is a challenge she believes Pope Francis failed to rise to, as she made clear when I asked her how she had reacted to the news of his death.",
      "\"I actually don't feel like I had much of a reaction,\" she replied.",
      "\"And I don't want to take away from the good that he did do, but there's just so much more that the Church and the Vatican and the people in charge can do.\"",
      "Uncovering the abuse",
      "The 1984 letter from Archbishop Bernard Law was addressed to a bishop in Thailand.",
      "Mentioning the accusation of \"child molestation\" it was written two months after the Boston court hearing, which had indeed concluded without scandal for the Church.",
      "Peter Kanchong - who was originally from Thailand - had been spared from formal criminal charges and given a year's probation on the condition that he stayed away from the MacPherson family and underwent a course of psychological therapy.",
      "The Archbishop's letter, however, noted that even the Church's own psychological evaluation had determined that the accused priest was \"not motivated and unresponsive to therapy\" and should therefore be \"forced to face the consequences of his actions\" under both civil and Church law.",
      "But instead of acting on that advice, he implored the Thai bishop to immediately recall Peter Kanchong to his diocese in Thailand, mentioning for a second time the risk of \"grave scandal\" if he were to remain in the US.",
      "Although press reports from the time suggest the Church authorities in Thailand did agree to take him back, Peter Kanchong ignored the recall, finding work in the Boston area at a facility for adults with learning disabilities.",
      "In 2002, more than 18 years after Ms MacPherson's father first called the police, the archbishop's letter was made public.",
      "In a landmark ruling, it was one of thousands of pages of documents that a Boston court ordered the Catholic Church to release.",
      "A local newspaper, The Boston Globe, had, for the first time, begun to seriously challenge the institution's power in the city, by placing the stories of victims on its front pages.",
      "Soon, hundreds had come forward and their lawyers were fighting in court to prise open decades of internal records relating to the sexual abuse of children.",
      "The Church had tried to argue that the First Amendment protection for freedom of religion entitled it to keep those files secret.",
      "The order to unseal them led to a watershed moment.",
      "Contacted at the time, Peter Kanchong denied the allegations.",
      "\"Do you have evidence? Do you have witnesses?\" he told the Boston Globe, who found him still living in the area.",
      "Ms MacPherson, however, was one of more than 500 victims who won an $85m civil case for the abuse they'd suffered at the hands of dozens of priests.",
      "The internal files showed that, time and again, Archbishop Law had dealt with his knowledge of abuse in the same way he'd attempted to deal with Peter Kanchong - by simply moving priests on to new parishes.",
      "After the settlement, and by then a Cardinal, Bernard Law resigned from his position in Boston and moved to Rome.",
      "For the survivors, the sense of Church impunity was further compounded when he was given the honour of a seven-year post as Archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the same building where Pope Francis has now been buried.",
      "Many Church insiders credit Francis with going further than his predecessors to address the issue of abuse.",
      "In 2019, he summoned more than a hundred bishops to Rome for a conference on the crisis.",
      "In the abuse of children, he told them, \"We see the hand of evil.\"",
      "The conference led to a revision of the Church law on \"pontifical secrecy\" allowing co-operation with the civil courts when required in cases of abuse.",
      "The change, however, doesn't compel the disclosure of all information relating to child abuse, only its disclosure in specific cases when formally requested by a legitimate authority.",
      "Similarly, a new law requiring that allegations be referred up the internal Church hierarchy stops short of mandating referral to the police.",
      "Ms MacPherson's lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, a man portrayed in the Hollywood blockbuster Spotlight about the Boston abuse scandal, told me there are plenty of ways the Church continues to exercise secrecy.",
      "\"We have to litigate in court to get documents, nothing really has changed,\" he said.",
      "His 2002 legal victory may have been a defining moment, followed by an avalanche of such cases in dozens of countries, but he has no doubt that knowledge of wrongdoing remains hidden in churches around the world.",
      "\"While he did some things, it's not enough,\" Ms MacPherson told me when I asked for her assessment of Pope Francis' record on this issue.",
      "She wants the Church to reveal everything it knows.",
      "\"One of the biggest things is turning over predatory priests and the people who covered it up and holding them accountable in a regular court of law and not shielding them and hiding them any longer.\"",
      "Watching the endless news of the Pope's funeral and the preparations for the appointment of his successor has been painful for her.",
      "\"It's the abuse being celebrated, in a way,\" she told me, \"Because the cover-ups are still there, they're shielded behind the Vatican walls and their canon laws.\"",
      "It is news coverage she's found hard to escape because of her mother's continuing faith in the Catholic Church.",
      "\"It's all I've heard on the news, and she is obsessed with watching this, and so I just get slammed and inundated with it.\"",
      "Now 85-years-old, Peter Kanchong meanwhile has never been convicted of an offence.",
      "Nor has he been stripped of his priesthood, although he has been prevented from holding any formal position in the Boston Diocese.",
      "The Church's own published list of accused clergy marks his case as \"not yet resolved\" with no final determination of guilt or innocence, noting simply that he is \"AWOL\" - absent without leave.",
      "\"I've been trying for years to have him defrocked and that is because he can only be defrocked either where he was ordained, which was in Thailand, or by the Vatican,\" Ms MacPherson said.",
      "She points out that the Church has gone to the trouble of changing the name of the parish where she was abused - in order, she believes, to try to start afresh after what took place there.",
      "The BBC asked the Boston Diocese for its views on Pope Francis' legacy as well as for a response to claims that the Catholic Church maintains a culture of secrecy over its own internal records.",
      "We received no reply to those questions.",
      "We also asked whether the current archbishop could do anything to help victims seeking to remove a priest from the priesthood.",
      "We were referred to the Vatican.",
      "As the Catholic Church now sets about the business of electing a new pope, Ms MacPherson holds little hope for more comprehensive reform.",
      "\"You say you want to move forward. You say you want to bring people back into the fold,\" she said.",
      "\"But you cannot possibly do any of that until you truly acknowledge those sins, and you hold those people accountable.\""

      "\"I thought it was some sort of ovarian or cervical cancer - something like that.\"",
      "He said it was a \"relatively short conversation\" and felt like it lasted around 10 minutes. The discussion ended because the Patterson children and a friend were arriving back at the house.",
      "\"I realised we weren't able to continue, and that we hadn't prayed about it,\" Mr Wilkinson said. \"I suggested we pray and I asked a prayer asking for God's blessing that Erin would get the treatment she needed, that the kids would be okay.\"",

    "story": [
      "Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas which includes the \"capture\" of Gaza and the holding of its territory, according to an Israeli official.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cabinet had decided on a \"forceful operation\" to destroy Hamas and rescue its remaining hostages, and that Gaza's 2.1 million population \"will be moved, to protect it\".",
      "He did not say how much territory would be seized by troops, but he stressed that \"they will not enter and come out\".",
      "The cabinet also approved, in principle, a plan to deliver aid through private companies, which would end a two-month blockade the UN says has caused severe food shortages.",
      "The UN and other aid agencies have said the proposal would be a breach of basic humanitarian principles and that they will not co-operate.",
      "A Hamas official said the group rejected Israel's \"pressure and blackmail\".",
      "Asked about the Israeli plan to expand its offensive, President Donald Trump repeated a pledge to help get food to Palestinians there.",

      "Israel's security cabinet met on Sunday evening to discuss the Gaza offensive, which resumed when Israel ended a two-month ceasefire on 18 March.",
      "An Israeli official who briefed the media on Monday morning said ministers voted unanimously to approve a plan proposed by the Israeli military's Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir to \"defeat Hamas in Gaza and return the hostages\".",
      "\"The plan will include, among other things, the capture of the Strip and holding the territories, moving the Gazan population south for its defence, denying Hamas the ability to distribute humanitarian supplies, and powerful attacks against Hamas,\" the official said.",
      "Israeli media reported that first stage would include the seizure of additional areas of Gaza and the expansion of the Israeli-designated \"buffer zone\" running along the territory's borders. It would aim to give Israel additional leverage in negotiations with Hamas on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.",
      "Later, a senior Israeli security official said the plan would not be implemented until after US President Donald Trump's visit to the region between 13 and 16 May, providing what he called \"a window of opportunity\" to Hamas to agree a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.",
      "Trump will visit Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar on his trip.",
      "Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich meanwhile told a conference in Jerusalem on Monday that Israel was \"going to finally occupy the Gaza Strip\", according to Reuters news agency.",
      "Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war along with the West Bank. It unilaterally withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but the UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because it retained control of Gaza's shared border, airspace and shoreline.",
      "In a briefing later on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the expanded campaign would displace most Palestinians in Gaza as air strikes and other military operations continued.",
      "However, critics say military action has failed to secure the return of the 59 remaining hostages - up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive - and have urged the government to strike a deal with Hamas.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents hostages' relatives, said the plan was an admission by the government that it was \"choosing territories over the hostages\" and that this was \"against the will of over 70% of the people\" in Israel.",
      "Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reiterated that the group wanted a comprehensive deal, including \"a complete ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza, reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, and the release of all prisoners from both sides\".",
      "Palestinians in north Gaza told the BBC that they were strongly opposed to being forcibly displaced to the south once again, with several saying they would rather die amid the ruins of their homes.",
      "\"In October 2023, I evacuated with my children, daughters, and grandchildren - about 60 people in total,\" 76-year-old Gaza City resident Ahmed Shehata said.",

      "Osama Tawfiq, a 48-year-old father of five, said: \"Israeli threats won't scare us. We are staying in Gaza.\"",
      "The Israeli official said the security cabinet also approved by a large majority \"the possibility of humanitarian [aid] distribution - if necessary - that would prevent Hamas from taking control of supplies and would destroy its governmental capabilities\".",
      "The security official said deliveries would resume once the expanded offensive began, and that the military would establish a \"sterile area\" in the southern Rafah area that Palestinians would be able to enter pending inspection.",
      "On Sunday, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), a forum that includes UN agencies, said Israeli officials were seeking to \"shut down the existing aid distribution system\" and \"have us agree to deliver supplies through Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military, once the government agrees to re-open crossings\".",
      "The HCT warned that the plan would mean large parts of Gaza, including less mobile and most vulnerable people, would continue to go without supplies.",
      "\"It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2013 as part of a military strategy,\" it said.",
      "\"It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarized zones to collect rations, threatening lives, including those of humanitarian workers, while further entrenching forced displacement.\"",
      "Israel cut off all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza aid on 2 March, two weeks before resuming its offensive.",
      "According to the UN, the population is facing a renewed risk of hunger and malnutrition because warehouses are empty, bakeries have shut, and community kitchens are days away from running out of supplies.",
      "The blockade has also cut off essential medicines, vaccines and medical equipment needed by Gaza's overwhelmed healthcare system.",
      "The UN says Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for Gaza's population, almost all of whom have been displaced. Israel says it is complying with international law and there is no shortage of aid.",

      "He will face liberal Bucharest Mayor Nicu\u0219or Dan, who narrowly defeated the Social Democrat (PSD) candidate.",
      "Sunday's result plunged Romania - an EU state on Nato's eastern flank - into further political turmoil. Ciolacu told colleagues that as their coalition had failed to meet its objective and \"has no legitimacy\", they should pull out of the government.",

      "Simion did particularly well with Romania's diaspora voters, polling more than 73% in Spain and almost 65% in the UK among a broadly blue-collar electorate.",
      "Public resentment at Romanian financial support for Ukrainian refugees has been a central plank in Simion's campaign, though he denies he is pro-Russian.",

    "summary": "Experts say the federal government would have to overcome enormous hurdles to make the facility operational again.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his proposal to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the once-notorious prison island in the icy waters of San Francisco Bay.",
      "Alcatraz - popularly known as \"the Rock\" - has not been used as a prison for decades. It is now a historic landmark visited by millions of tourists each year.",
      "The US president says he believes the prison could be used once again to house dangerous inmates, and to serve as a symbol of law and order in the US.",
      "But experts say that refurbishing the dilapidated remains of the once-formidable prison is \"not realistic at all\". Here's what we know about the plan.",
      "What is Alcatraz and who owns it?",
      "Located on an island about 1.25 miles (2km) offshore from San Francisco, Alcatraz  originally was built as a naval defence fort, but was rebuilt in the early 20th century as a military prison.",
      "In 1934, it was formally converted into a federal prison - Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary - housing notorious inmates including gangster Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly, among others.",
      "The prison was among one of the most notorious in the US at the time, and was considered inescapable because of the strong currents and frigid temperatures of San Francisco Bay.",

      "Trump orders reopening of notorious Alcatraz prison",
      "The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon",
      "Alcatraz 1962 escapees had small chance of success",
      "The facility also was made famous by the 1979 American biographical prison movie, Escape from Alcatraz, which recounted a 1962 prisoner escape, starring Clint Eastwood as ringleader Frank Morris.",
      "It was also the site of the 1996 film The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, about a former SAS captain and FBI chemist who rescue hostages from Alcatraz Island.",
      "When did Alcatraz close?",
      "According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, BOP, it was nearly three times more costly to operate than other federal institutions and was ultimately closed by Attorney General Robert Kennedy in 1963.",
      "The island and prison are now a museum operated by the National Park Service. More than 1.4m people visit each year.",
      "\"Alcatraz is a place where the past meets the present,\" Christine Lehnertz, president and CEO of the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, said in a statement sent to the BBC.",
      "\"It challenges us to listen, to learn, and to carry forward the stories that still shape our world today,\" she added.",
      "Has it been considered for reopening before?",
      "Donald Trump is not the first president to mull re-opening the facility as a detention centre.",
      "In 1981, Alcatraz was one of 14 sites considered by the Reagan administration to hold up to 20,000 refugees who had fled from Cuba to Florida in the famous \"Mariel Boatlift\".",
      "The site eventually was rejected due to its value as a historical tourist site and its complete lack of adequate facilities.",
      "What has Donald Trump said about Alcatraz?",
      "In a Truth Social post on 4 May, Trump first said he had directed his government to re-open and expand the island prison, saying that \"for too long America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders\".",
      "Speaking to reporters at the White House the following day, Trump said that, in his view, Alcatraz \"represents something very strong, very powerful\" - law and order.",
      "\"We need law and order in this country,\" he said. \"So we're going to look at it. Some of the people up here are going to be working very hard on that.\"",
      "While he said he finds the idea \"interesting\", Trump also acknowledged that the prison is currently a \"big hulk\" that is \"rusting and rotting\".",
      "\"It sort of represents something that is both horrible and beautiful and strong and miserable,\" he said.",
      "Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, also told reporters that Alcatraz could be \"an option\" for \"significant public safety threats and national security threats\".",
      "\"It should be on the table,\" he added.",
      "Can Alcatraz actually be reopened?",
      "Soon after Trump's comments made news around the world, justice department spokesman Chad Gilmartin said in a statement that BOP \"is working towards rebuilding and opening Alcatraz to serve as a symbol of law and order\".",
      "But prison experts and historians have expressed serious doubts whether the plan is feasible.",
      "\"To be frank, at first I thought it was a joke,\" Hugh Hurwitz, who served as acting director of the BOP between May 2018 and August 2019, told the BBC. \"It's not realistic to think you can repair it. You'd have to tear it up and start over.\"",
      "Mr Hurwitz pointed to a number of issues with the facility, including buildings that are \"literally falling apart\", and cells in which \"a six-foot person can't stand up\".",
      "\"There's no security upgrades. No cameras. No fencing,\" he added. \"You can't run a prison.\"",
      "\"I have two words: water and sewage,\" said Jolene Babyak, an author and Alcatraz historian who lived there as a child during her father's two stints as prison administrator.",
      "\"In its heyday, all the sewage for 500 or more people was just dumped in the bay,\" she said. \"Nowadays it has to be boated off. It's just not realistic at all. But it captures everyone's imagination.\"",
      "When the facility closed in 1963, the BOP said it was nearly three times more expensive to operate Alcatraz than any other federal prison - the per-capita cost  being $10 and $13 per inmate, compared to between $3 and $5 at other facilities.

      "When he cries during our interview, it's not for Mahmoud - or even for himself. It's for his little brother, killed in a bomb attack by President Assad's former army in 2018 as his family sat down at home to break their Ramadan fast.",

    "summary": "President Trump says the famous island prison off San Francisco is to be reopened to house \"ruthless and violent\" offenders.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump says he is directing his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.",
      "In a message on his Truth Social site on Sunday, President Trump said that \"for too long America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders\".",
      "The reopening of Alcatraz - once notorious as one of the US's toughest prisons - would serve as a \"symbol of law, order, and justice,\" he said.",
      "Leading Democrats said the proposal was \"not a serious one\". The maximum security facility, also known as The Rock, was closed in 1963 and it is currently operating as a successful tourist site.",
      "\"Today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ,\" Trump wrote.",
      "The prison would \"house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders\".",
      "President Trump has been clashing with the courts over his policy of sending alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador. In March, he sent a group of more than 200 alleged Venezuelan gang members there. He has also talked about sending \"homegrown criminals\" to foreign prisons.",
      "Alcatraz was originally a naval defence fort, and it was rebuilt in the early 20th Century as a military prison. The Department of Justice took it over in the 1930s and it began taking in convicts from the federal prison system. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly.",
      "The prison was also made famous by the 1962 film, Birdman of Alcatraz, starring Burt Lancaster, about the convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who while serving a life sentence on the prison island developed an interest in birds and went on to become an expert ornithologist.",
      "In 1979, the American biographical prison drama Escape from Alcatraz recounted a 1962 prisoner escape with Clint Eastwood starring as ringleader Frank Morris.",
      "It was also the site of the 1996 film The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, about a former SAS captain and FBI chemist who rescue hostages from Alcatraz island.",
      "The prison closed because it was too expensive to continue operating, according to the Federal Bureau of Prison website. It was nearly three times more costly to operate than any other federal prison, largely due to its island location.",
      "It would take an enormous amount of money to make Alcatraz into a functioning prison, Professor Gabriel Jack Chin from the Davis School of Law at the University of California told the BBC.",
      "The federal prison system is actually down about 25% from its peak population and \"there are a lot of empty beds\" in existing prisons, Chin said. \"So its not clear if a new one is needed.\"",
      "Alcatraz has \"a reputation as a tough prison\" and Trump is trying to send a message that his administration will be tough on crime, Chin added.",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes Alcatraz, said the proposal was \"not a serious one,\"  while the Democratic state senator for San Francisco, Scott Wiener, called the idea \"deeply unhinged\" in a post on Instagram and \"an attack on the rule of law.\""

    "summary": "To many, the close relationship between the US and Israel seems permanent and unshakeable.",
    "story": [
      "I ran from the White House briefing room, past the portico entrance of the West Wing to our camera position on the lawn, and flung on an ear piece connecting me to the studio.",
      "A moment later the presenter asked me about the comments we had just heard live from US President Donald Trump.",
      "I said we were seeing a fundamental shift in a United States'\u202fpolicy position after decades of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",
      "It was February this year, and Trump had just held talks with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - the first foreign leader since Trump's inauguration to be invited to the White House. The US president vowed that his country would take control of the Gaza Strip, having earlier pledged the territory would also be \"cleaned out\" and emptied of its Palestinian population.",
      "Trump was grabbing the world's attention with a proposal that hardened his administration's support for Israel and also upended international norms, flying in the face of international law. It marked an apex of the current Republican Party's relationship with Israel - sometimes described as support \"at all costs\".",
      "The alliance between the two countries had been thrust into the international spotlight after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 and Israel's offensive in Gaza that followed.",
      "During that war, the administration of President Joe Biden sent some $18bn (\u00a313.5bn) worth of weapons to Israel, maintaining unprecedented levels of US backing. The period was marked by intensifying protests in the US, with many of those protesting being traditional Democrat leaning voters. The fallout became the focus of a bitter culture war centring on American attitudes towards Israel and the Palestinians. I covered demonstrations in which protesters repeatedly labelled Biden \"Genocide Joe\" \u2013 an accusation he always rejected.",
      "At the time Donald Trump branded the protesters \"radical-left lunatics\" and the Trump administration is now targeting for deportation hundreds of foreign students who it accuses of antisemitism or support for Hamas, a move being vigorously challenged in the courts.",
      "But as a Democrat who could otherwise have expected the vote of many of those upset over his support for Israel that support was politically costly for Biden in a way not experienced by previous presidents or, indeed, Trump.",
      "One of Biden's key decision makers over relations with Israel still wrestles with the decisions they took.",
      "\"My first reaction is just, I understand that this has evoked incredibly passionate feelings for Arab Americans, for non-Arab Americans, Jewish Americans,\" says Jake Sullivan, Biden's former national security adviser.",
      "\"There were two competing considerations: one was wanting to curb Israel's excesses, both with respect to civilian casualties and the flow of humanitarian assistance. The other was [...] wanting to make sure that we were not cutting Israel off from the capabilities it needed to confront its enemies on multiple different fronts.\"",
      "He added: \"The United States stood behind Israel materially, morally, and in every other way in those days following October 7th.\"",
      "But opinion polls suggest support for Israel among the American public is dwindling.",
      "A Gallup survey taken in March this year found only 46% of Americans expressed support for Israel (the lowest level in 25 years of Gallup's annual tracking) while 33% now said they sympathised with the Palestinians - the highest ever reading of that measure. Other polls have found similar results.",
      "Surveys - with all their limitations - suggest the swing is largely among Democrats and the young, although not exclusively. Between 2022 and 2025, the Pew Research Center found that the proportion of Republicans who said they had unfavourable views of Israel rose from 27% to 37%  (younger Republicans, aged under 49, drove most of that change).",
      "The US has long been Israel's most powerful ally - ever since May 1948, when America was the first country to recognise the nascent State of Israel. But while US support for Israel is extremely likely to continue long-term, these swings in sentiment raise questions over the practical extent and policy limits of the US's ironclad backing and whether the shifting sands of public opinion will eventually feed through to Washington, with real-world policy impacts.",
      "An Oval Office argument",
      "To many, the close relationship between the US and Israel seems like a permanent, unshakeable part of the geopolitical infrastructure. But it wasn't always guaranteed - and at the very beginning largely came down to one man.",
      "In early 1948, US President Harry S Truman had to decide on his approach to Palestine. The country was in the grip of sectarian bloodshed between Jews and Arab Palestinians after three decades of colonial rule by Britain, which had announced its intention to pull out. Truman was deeply moved by the plight of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust stranded in displaced persons camps in Europe.",
      "In New York City, a young Francine Klagsbrun, who would later become an academic and historian of Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, watched her parents praying for a Jewish homeland.",
      "\"I grew up in a very Jewish home and a very Zionist home also,\" she explains. \"So my older brother and I would go out and collect money to try to get England to open the doors. My brother would go on the subway trains, all the doors open on the train and he'd shout 'open, open, open the doors to Palestine',\" she recalls.",
      "Truman's administration was deeply divided over whether to back a Jewish state. The CIA and the Department of State cautioned against recognising a Jewish state. They feared a bloody conflict with Arab countries that might draw in the US, risking Cold War escalation with the Soviets.",
      "Two days before Britain was due to pull out of Palestine, an explosive row took place in the Oval Office. Truman's domestic advisor Clark Clifford argued in favour of recognising a Jewish state. On the other side of the debate was Secretary of State George Marshall, a World War Two general whom Truman viewed as \"the greatest living American\".",
      "The man Truman admired so much was vigorously opposed to the president immediately recognising a Jewish state because of his fears about a regional war - and even went as far as telling Truman he would not vote for him in the coming presidential election if he backed recognition.",
      "But despite the moment of extraordinary tension, Truman immediately recognised the State of Israel when it was declared two days later by David Ben-Gurion, the country's first prime minister.",
      "The historian Rashid Khalidi, a New York-born Palestinian whose family members were expelled from Jerusalem by the British in the 1930s, says the US and Israel were fused together in part by shared cultural connections. From 1948 onwards, he says, the Palestinians had a critical diplomatic disadvantage in the US, with their claim to national self-determination sidelined in an unequal contest.",
      "\"On the one side, you had the Zionist movement led by people whom are European and American by origin\u2026 The Arabs had nothing similar,\" he says. \"[The Arabs] weren't familiar with the societies, the cultures, the political leaderships of the countries that decided the fate of Palestine. How could you speak to American public opinion if you had no idea what America is like?\" says Khalidi.",
      "Popular culture played its role too - notably the 1958 novel and subsequent blockbuster film Exodus by the author Leon Uris. It retold the story of Israel's establishment to mass audiences of the 1960s, the movie version creating a heavily Americanised portrayal of pioneers in a new land.",
      "Ehud Olmert, who at the time was a political activist but would later become Israeli prime minister, points to the war of 1967 as the moment when America's support for Israel became the profound alliance that it is today.",
      "That was the war in which Israel, after weeks of escalating fears of invasion by its neighbours, defeated the Arab countries in six days, effectively tripling the size of its territory, and launching its military occupation over (at that time) more than a million stateless Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "\"For the first time, the United States understood the importance and the significance of Israel as a major military and political power in the Middle East, and since then everything has changed in the basic relations within our two countries,\" he says.",
      "Indispensable relations",
      "Over the years, Israel became the biggest recipient of US foreign military aid on Earth. Strong American diplomatic support, particularly at the United Nations, has been a key element of the alliance; while successive US presidents have also sought to broker peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours.",
      "But in recent years it has been far from a straightforward relationship.",
      "When I spoke to Jake Sullivan, I put to him the issue of Arab Americans in the state of Michigan who boycotted Biden and his successor candidate Kamala Harris over the extent of their support for Israel during the Gaza conflict, voting instead for Trump. He rejected the idea that Biden lost the state because of this support.",
      "But that backing still prompted a marked backlash within a section of the American public.",
      "A Pew Research Center survey taken in March this year found that 53% of Americans expressed an unfavourable opinion of Israel, an 11 point increase since the last time the survey was taken in 2022.",
      "A fraying special relationship?",
      "Currently, these shifts in public opinion haven't yet prompted a major change in US foreign policy. Whilst some ordinary US voters are turning away from Israel, on Capitol Hill elected politicians from both parties are still mostly keen to talk up the importance of a strong alliance with Israel.",
      "Some think that a sustained, long-term shift in public opinion might eventually lead to reduced real-world support for the country - with weaker diplomatic ties and reduced military aid. This issue is felt particularly sharply by some inside Israel. Several months before 7 October, the former Israeli general and head of the Military Intelligence Directorate, Tamir Hayman, warned of cracks forming between his country and the United States, in part because of what he described as the slow movement of American Jews away from Zionism.",
      "Israel's political shift in favour of the national-religious right has played a key part in this. From early 2023, Israel was gripped by an unprecedented wave of protests among Jewish Israelis against Netanyahu's judicial reforms, with many arguing he was moving the country towards theocracy \u2013 a claim he always rejected. Some in the US who had always felt a deep sense of connection with Israel were watching with growing concern.",
      "In March this year, the Institute for National Security Studies, a leading Tel Aviv-based think tank led by Hayman, published a paper arguing that US public opinion had entered the \"danger zone\", as far as support for Israel was concerned. \"The dangers of diminished US support, particularly as it reflects long-term and deeply rooted trends, cannot be overstated,\" wrote the paper's author, Theodore Sasson. \"Israel needs the support of the global superpower for the foreseeable future,\".",
      "That support at the policy level has only strengthened over the decades, but it is important to note that historic American opinion polling shows public opinion has ebbed and flowed before.",
      "Today, Dennis Ross, who helped negotiate the Oslo accords with President Bill Clinton, says American opinion on Israel has become increasingly tied to sharp political divisions in the US.",
      "\"Trump is viewed very negatively by most Democrats - the latest polls show over 90 percent,\" Ross says. \"There's potential for Trumpian support for Israel to feed a dynamic here that, at least among Democrats, increases criticism of Israel.\"",
      "But he expects that Washington's support for Israel - in the form of military aid and diplomatic ties - will continue. And he thinks if Israeli voters eject their prime minister and replace him with a more centrist government, one that may reverse some of the disquiet in the US. A general election must be held in Israel before late October next year.",
      "Under such a new Israeli government, Ross argues, \"there won't be the same impulse towards creating de-facto annexation of the West Bank. There'll be much more outreach to the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party officials.\"",
      "Those who see a fraying relationship are paying particularly close attention to the views of younger Americans - a group that has shown the most marked shift in opinion since 7 October. As the 'TikTok generation', many young Americans get their news about the war from social media and the high civilian death toll from Israel's offensive in Gaza appears to have driven the declining support among young Democrats and liberals in America. Last year, 33 percent of Americans under 30 said their sympathies lie entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people, versus 14 percent who said the same about Israelis, according to a Pew Research poll published last month. Older Americans were more likely to sympathise with the Israelis.",
      "Karin Von Hippel, chair of the Arden Defence and Security Practice and a former official in the US State Department, agrees there is a demographic divide among Americans on the topic of Israel - one that even extends to Congress.",
      "\"Younger Congress men and women are less knee jerk, reactively supporting Israel,\" she says. \"And I think younger Americans, including Jewish Americans, are less supportive of Israel than their parents were.\"",
      "But she is sceptical of the idea that this might lead to a serious change at the policy level. Despite changing opinions among the party's base, she says, many of the most prominent Democrats who might run for President in 2028 are \"classically supportive of Israel\". She names Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, and Pete Buttigieg, the former Transportation Secretary, as examples. And what about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Instagram-famous congresswoman who is a long-standing supporter of Palestinian rights? Hippel responds bluntly: \"I don't think an Ocasio-Cortez type can win right now.\"",
      "In the weeks after February's Trump-Netanyahu press conference at the White House, I asked Jake Sullivan where he thought the US-Israel relationship was going. He argued that both countries were dealing with internal threats to their democratic institutions that would define their character and their relationship.",
      "\"I think it's almost less of a foreign policy question than it is a domestic policy question in these two countries - whither America and whither Israel?\" he says. \"The answer to those two questions will tell you where does the US-Israel relationship go five, ten, fifteen years from now.\"",
      "Xi's real test is not Trump's trade war",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "Will this be the 'anyone but the big parties' local election?",

    "summary": "Himanshi Narwal's husband was among the victims of the deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir.",
    "story": [
      "Two weeks ago, the photograph of a woman sitting motionless beside her husband's body went viral across Indian social media.",
      "It captured a moment of unspeakable grief - one that came to symbolise the 22 April militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in which 26 civilians were killed.",
      "The woman in the photo was Himanshi Narwal, whose husband, a 26-year-old naval officer, was among the victims. The couple, who had been married for less than a week, were on their honeymoon when Vinay Narwal was shot dead.",
      "But within days, Ms Narwal, who had been portrayed as the face of the tragedy, found herself at the centre of a hate campaign.",
      "It started last week when she urged people not to target Muslims or Kashmiris as emotions ran high across the country.",
      "Survivors of the attack have said that Hindu men were targeted, and that the victims were shot after the militants checked their religion. Indian security forces are still searching for the attackers.",
      "Since the attack, there have been reports of Kashmiri vendors and students in other Indian cities facing harassment and threats, mainly from members of Hindu right-wing groups.",
      "'We are too scared to go back': Kashmiris in India face violence after deadly attack",
      "'We are too scared to go back': Kashmiris in India face violence after deadly attack",
      "\"People going against Muslims or Kashmiris - we don't want this. We want peace and only peace,\" Ms Narwal told reporters at a blood donation camp held by the family on what would have been her husband's 27th birthday. \"Of course, we want justice. The people who have wronged him should be punished,\" she added.",
      "It was her first public statement since a video of her bidding an emotional farewell over her husband's coffin went viral. In it, the grief-stricken widow says with tears: \"It is because of him that the world is still surviving. And we should all be proud of him in every way.\"",
      "Her appeal for peace sparked a swift backlash. Within hours, many of the internet users who had earlier mourned her loss were posting abusive comments.",
      "Some accused her of dishonouring her husband's memory as she refused to blame ordinary Kashmiris for the attack. Others made and shared unfounded claims about her friendships and relationships with Kashmiri men while studying at a university in Delhi. Yet more claimed that she had no right to speak about her husband's death as they were only married for a few days.",
      "As the online abuse continued, India's National Commission for Women (NCW) wrote on X that the trolling was \"extremely reprehensible and unfortunate\".",
      "\"Perhaps her reaction may not have gone down well with angry people. But any kind of agreement or disagreement should always be expressed with decency and within constitutional limits,\" NCW Chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar wrote on X.",
      "Journalist Namita Bhandare, who covers gender issues, told the BBC that it was \"shocking\" how much hatred Ms Narwal received for simply appealing for peace and calm.",
      "She was viciously trolled because she \"appealed for peace rather than succumbing to the narrative of revenge\", Ms Bhandare added.",
      "Ms Narwal was not the only survivor of the attack to face online abuse.",
      "Arathi R Menon, the daughter of a man from Kerala state who was killed in the shootings, was also trolled after she recounted her ordeal in front of the media.",
      "Some people said that she spoke too calmly and didn't display much emotion as she recounted her father's death. Others found fault with her praising two Kashmiri men who she said helped her and took care of her \"like a sister\".",
      "\"It is the same old story - women are always the easy targets,\" says Ms Bhandare, adding that female victims of online abuse are also likely to be sexualised and threatened with violence.",
      "\"Being faceless online gives people the courage to say whatever they want,\" she says. \"And of course, there's patriarchy at play, women are singled out, no matter who they are.\"",
      "Amid the abuse, Ms Narwal received support online as well.",
      "\"Your [Ms Narwal's] statement in the face of that loss was an act of grace and unimaginable strength,\" writer and activist Gurmehar Kaur wrote on X.",
      "\"My mother was your age when she lost my father in the [Kashmir] valley. I know this kind of loss.\"",
      "In 2017, Kaur, then a graduate student, became the target of a vicious social media campaign after she spoke against a Hindu right-wing student group after a clash at a college in Delhi. Many of the people who trolled her took issue with an earlier campaign by her where she said her father, a soldier who died in 1999, was killed by war, not Pakistan.",
      "Journalist Rohini Singh welcomed the NCW's statement supporting Ms Narwal, but asked why no action had been taken against the social media accounts \"blatantly abusing and slandering her\".",
      "Members of India's opposition parties have also urged the government to act.",
      "Priyanka Chaturvedi, an MP from the Shiv Sena (UBT) party, tagged federal Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw in a post, asking him to \"stand with the widow of an Indian officer\" and take action against the trolling.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 23:44:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Cardinals are set to gather later this week to take part in a highly guarded vote for a new pope.",
    "story": [
      "This must be the most secretive election in the world.",
      "When 133 Catholic cardinals are shut into the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday to choose a successor to Pope Francis, each one will have sworn an oath on the gospels to keep the details under wraps for life.",
      "The same goes for every person inside the Vatican during the conclave: from the two doctors on hand for any emergency, to the dining-room staff who feed the cardinals. All vow to observe \"absolute and perpetual secrecy\".",
      "Just to be sure, the chapel and the two guesthouses will be swept for microphones and bugs.",
      "\"There are electronic jammers to make sure that phone and wi-fi signals are not getting in or out,\" said John Allen, the editor of Crux news site.",
      "\"The Vatican takes the idea of isolation extremely seriously.\"",
      "Total lockdown",
      "The famous lockdown is not only about keeping the voting process itself secret: stopping \"nefarious forces\" from attempting to hack it for information or to disrupt things.",
      "The measures are also about ensuring the men in red total seclusion from the secular world and its influences as they prepare to vote.",
      "Catholics will tell you the election is guided by God, not politics. But the hierarchy takes no chances.",
      "On entering the conclave, everyone is obliged to surrender all electronic devices including phones, tablets and smart watches. The Vatican has its own police to enforce the rules.",
      "\"The logic is trust but verify,\" John Allen said.",
      "\"There are no televisions, newspapers or radio at the guesthouse for the conclave \u2013 nothing,\" said Monsignor Paolo de Nicolo, who was head of the Papal household for three decades.",
      "\"You can't even open the windows because many rooms have windows to the exterior world.\"",
      "Everyone working behind the high Vatican walls for the conclave has been heavily vetted. Even so, they are barred from communicating with electors.",
      "\"The cardinals are completely incommunicado,\" said Ines San Martin of the Pontifical Mission Societies in the US.",
      "\"There will just be walkie-talkies for some specific circumstances like, 'we need a medic,' or 'Hey, the Pope has been elected, can someone let the bell-ringers in the Basilica know.'\"",
      "So what if someone breaks the rules?",
      "\"There is an oath, and those who do not observe it risk ex-communication,\" Msgr De Nicolo says, meaning exclusion from the church. \"No one dares to do this.\"",
      "Cardinal hunting",
      "It's a different matter in the run-up to the conclave.",
      "Officially, the cardinals are banned from commenting even now. But from the moment Pope Francis was buried, parts of the Italian press and many visitors turned cardinal-hunters, trying to suss out his most likely successor.",
      "They have been scouring the tourist-filled restaurants and gelato joints around the Vatican, ready to speculate on any sightings and possible alliances.",
      "\"Wine and Rigatoni: the Cardinals' Last Suppers\", was one headline in La Repubblica which described the \"princes of the church\" enjoying \"good Roman lunches\" before lockdown.",
      "Reporters have then been grilling waiters on what they might have overheard.",
      "\"Nothing,\" one of the servers at Roberto's, a couple of streets back from St Peter's, told me this week.",
      "\"They always go quiet whenever we get close.\"",
      "The other prime spot to catch a cardinal is beside the basilica itself, next to the curve of columns that embraces the main square. Each morning there's a huddle of cameras and reporters on the lookout for the men in lace and scarlet robes.",
      "There are now close to 250 cardinals in the city, called here from all over the world, although those aged 80 or over are not eligible to vote.",
      "As they head into the Vatican for their daily congregations to discuss the election, each one is surrounded and bombarded with questions on progress.",
      "They've given away little in response beyond the \"need for unity\" or assurances that the conclave will be short.",
      "The outside world",
      "\"The whole idea is for this to be a religious decision, not a political one,\" Ines San Martin explains. \"We say the Holy Spirit guides the conversation and the vote.\"",
      "But the Pope heads a huge, wealthy institution with significant moral authority and global sway on everything from conflict resolution to sexual politics.",
      "So the man chosen \u2013 and his vision and priorities \u2013 matter far beyond the Vatican.",
      "Certain Catholic monarchs had a veto on the election up until 1907. Today, voices from all quarters try to influence the debate \u2013 most obviously through the media.",
      "At one point, Rome's Il Messaggero chided a presumed front-runner, Italian Cardinal Parolin, for \"a sort of self-candidacy\".",
      "Then there was a video clip of Filipino Cardinal Tagle singing John Lennon's Imagine, apparently released to dent his popularity. It went viral instead.",
      "Meanwhile, a glossy book highlighting some potential contenders is doing the rounds, lauding conservatives like Cardinal Sarah of Guinea for condemning the \"contemporary evils\" of abortion and the \"same-sex agenda\".",
      "\"There are groups in town who are trying to bang the drum on issues of interest to them,\" John Allen says. \"The cardinals are aware of this kind of thing, they read the papers. But they will do everything they can to block it out.\"",
      "\"Are there lobbies going on? Yes, like in every election,\" Ines San Martin agrees. \"But it's not as loud as I thought it would be.\"",
      "She argues that is partly because Pope Francis appointed so many new cardinals, including from new places.",
      "\"Fifty or sixty percent of them don't even know one another. So even if you were an outside group, trying to have an agenda, it's very hard even to pick your cardinals to begin with.\"",
      "Shutting out the noise",
      "By Wednesday morning, all the electors should be in place inside the Vatican \u2013 stripped of their phones and sealed off from the rest of the world.",
      "From then on John Allen believes personal preference will dominate over politics, liberal or conservative factions or the \"rattle and hum of public debate\".",
      "\"I really think the cardinals' discussions among themselves right now is key,\" Ines San Martin agrees. \"A lot have been speaking up for the first time. You never know just how inspiring one of them might be.\"",

    "title": "India worried about Chinese 'dumping' as trade tensions with Trump escalate",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg5d505v8xo",
    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 23:58:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts warn that a flood of cheap Chinese goods could hurt the competitiveness of Indian exports.",
    "story": [
      "The pace at 64-year-old Thirunavkarsu's spinning mill in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has noticeably slowed down.",
      "The viscose yarn \u2013 a popular material that goes into making woven garments \u2013 he produces, now sits in storage, as orders from local factories have dropped nearly 40% in the last month.",
      "That's because Chinese imports of the material have become cheaper by 15 rupees ($0.18; \u00a30.13) per kilo and flooded Indian ports.",
      "With Donald Trump imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods going into the US, manufacturers in China have begun looking for alternative markets.",
      "India's textiles makers say they are bearing the brunt of the trade tensions as Chinese producers are dumping yarn in key production hubs.",
      "While China is the leading producer of viscose yarn, India makes most of the viscose yarn the country needs locally with imports only bridging supply gaps.",
      "Mill owners like Thirunavkarsu fear their yarn won't survive the onslaught of such competition.",
      "\"We can't match these rates. Our raw material is not as cheap,\" he says.",
      "Jagadesh Chandran, of the South India Spinners Association, told the BBC nearly 50 small spinning mills in the textile hubs of Pallipalayam, Karur and Tirupur in southern India are \"slowing production\". Many say they'll be forced to scale down further if the issue isn't addressed.",
      "China's Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has sent assurances to India that his country will not dump products and in fact wants to buy more high-quality Indian products for Chinese consumers.",
      "\"We will not engage in market dumping or cut-throat competition, nor will we disrupt other countries' industries and economic development,\" he wrote in an opinion piece for the Indian Express newspaper.",
      "But anxieties about dumping are spread across sectors in India, as China - Asia's biggest economy - is the world's largest exporter of practically all industrial goods, from textiles and metals, to chemicals and rare minerals.",
      "While pharmaceuticals - and later phones, laptops, and semiconductor chips - were exempted from steep tariffs, large chunks of Chinese exports still run into Trump's 145% tariff wall. It is these goods that are expected to chase other markets like India.",
      "Their sudden inflow will prove \"very disruptive\" to emerging economies in Asia, according to Japanese broking house Nomura, whose research earlier revealed that China was flooding global markets with cheap goods even before Donald Trump took office earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, investigations against unfair Chinese imports rose to a record high. Data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) shows nearly 200 complaints were filed against China at the forum - a record - including 37 from India.",
      "India, in particular, with heavy dependencies on Chinese raw materials and intermediate goods, could be hit hard. Its trade deficit with China - the difference between what it imports and exports - has already ballooned to $100bn (\u00a375bn). And imports in March jumped 25%, driven by electronics, batteries and solar cells.",
      "In response, India's trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with its quasi-judicial arm probing imports across sectors, including viscose yarn.",
      "India also recently imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports, locally known as a safeguard duty, to help halt an increase in cheap shipments primarily from China, which were pushing some Indian mills to scale down.",
      "Despite such protections - and a loud marketing campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to boost manufacturing locally - India has found it hard to reduce its reliance on China, with imports rising even when border tensions between the two neighbours peaked after 2020.",
      "That's because the government has only had \"limited success\" with its plans to turn India into the world's factory through things like the production linked subsidies, says Biswajit Dhar, a Delhi-based trade expert. And India continues to depend heavily on China for the intermediate goods that go into manufacturing finished products.",
      "While western multi-national companies like Apple are increasingly looking towards India to diversify their assembly lines away from China, India is still dependent on Chinese components to make these phones. As a result, imports in sectors like electronics have risen significantly, pushing up its trade deficit.",
      "India's burgeoning deficit is a \"worrying story\", says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) think tank, all the more so because its exports to China have dropped to below 2014 levels despite a weaker currency, which should ideally help exporters.",
      "\"This isn't just a trade imbalance. It's a structural warning. Our industrial growth, including through PLI (production linked incentive) schemes, is fuelling imports, not building domestic depth,\" Srivastava wrote in a social media post. In other words, the subsidies are not helping India export more.",
      "\"We can't bridge this deficit without bridging our competitiveness gap.\"",
      "India needs to get its act together quickly to do that, given the opportunity US trade tensions with China have presented. But also because countries with a large rise in imports from China generally tend to see the sharpest slowdown in manufacturing growth, according to Nomura.",
      "Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital agrees. A key reason why Indian private companies were not investing enough, was because they feared being \"swamped by China\", he wrote in a column in the Business Standard newspaper. A recent study by the ratings agency Icra also corroborates this view.",
      "With fears of Chinese dumping becoming more widespread and the likes of the European Union seeking firm guarantees from Beijing that its markets will not be flooded, pressure is mounting on China - which is now urgently looking to secure newer trading partners outside the US.",
      "China wants to completely shift the narrative, says Mr Dhar, \"It is trying to come clean amidst increased scrutiny\".",
      "Despite the reassurances from Beijing, Delhi should use thawing relations with its larger neighbour to kickstart a proper dialogue on its firm stance about dumping, says Mr Dhar.",
      "\"This is an issue that India must flag, like most of the Western countries have.\"",

    "story": [
      "Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine: at least 45,287 people were killed.",
      "This is almost three times more than in the first year of the invasion and significantly exceeds the losses of 2023, when the longest and deadliest battle of the war was taking place in Bakhmut.",
      "At the start of the war, losses happened in waves during battles for key locations, but 2024 saw a month-on-month increase in the death toll as the front line slowly edged forward, enabling us to estimate that Russia lost at least 27 lives for every square kilometre of Ukrainian territory captured.",
      "The BBC Russian Service, in collaboration with independent media outlet Mediazona and a team of volunteers, has processed open source data from Russian cemeteries, military memorials and obituaries.",
      "So far, we have identified the names of 106,745 Russian soldiers killed during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The true number is clearly much higher. Military experts estimate our number may cover between 45% and 65% of deaths, which would mean 164,223 to 237,211 people.",
      "20 February 2024 was the deadliest day for Russian forces that year.",
      "Among the casualties were Aldar Bairov, Igor Babych and Okhunjon Rustamov, who were with the 36th Motorised Rifle Brigade when four Ukrainian long-range HIMARS missiles hit a training ground near the city of Volnovakha in occupied Donetsk.",
      "They had been ordered to line up for a medal ceremony. Sixty-five servicemen were killed, including their commander Col Musaev. Dozens more were wounded.",
      "Bairov, 22 and from Buryatia in eastern Siberia, had studied to be a food sanitation specialist but was drafted for mandatory military service and then signed a contract to become a professional soldier.",
      "In February 2022 he went to fight in Ukraine and was part of the battle for Borodyanka during his brigade's advance towards Kyiv in March 2022. The town was almost completely destroyed. Ukrainian sources say Russian soldiers were involved in the execution of civilians.",
      "Okhunjon Rustamov, 31 and from Chita in Siberia, had worked as a welder after serving a mandatory term in special forces. He was mobilised during a partial draft in October 2022.",
      "Unlike Rustamov, Igor Babych, 32, had volunteered to go to war. He had worked with adults and children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, helping them with physical therapy until April 2023.",
      "In total 201 Russian soldiers died on that day, according to our data.",
      "A few hours after the strike on the training ground, then-Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu met Vladimir Putin to bring him news of military success from the front line.",
      "There was no mention of the training ground attack, nor was there any word from the Ministry of Defence in its daily reports.",
      "A relative of Okhunjon Rustamov said she had already buried three close family members over the course of the war. \"In December 2022, my husband died. On 10 February 2024, my godfather. And on 20 February my half-brother. From one funeral to the next.\"",
      "In our analysis, we prioritised exact dates of death for soldiers. If that wasn't available, we used the date of the funeral or the date the death was reported.",
      "In the first two years of the war, 2022 and 2023, Russian losses followed a wave-like pattern: heavy fighting with high casualties alternated with periods of relative calm.",
      "In 2023, for example, most casualties occurred between January and March, when Russian forces attempted to capture the cities of Vuhledar and Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast.",
      "In the first year of the full-scale invasion, according to our calculations, Russia lost at least 17,890 soldiers. This number does not include losses from Russia's two proxy forces in occupied eastern Ukraine.",
      "In 2023, the number rose to 37,633.",
      "In 2024, there was no period showing a significant fall in casualties. Bloody battles for Avdiivka and Robotyne were followed by intensified assaults towards Pokrovsk and Toretsk.",
      "In August 2024, Russian conscripts were killed when Ukrainian forces stormed over the border into the Kursk region. From August 6 to 13 alone, an estimated 1,226 Russian soldiers died.",
      "However, the heaviest overall losses occurred during a slow Russian advance in the east between September and November 2024, according to leading US military analyst Michael Kofman.",
      "\"Tactics emphasised repeated attacks with dispersed assault groups, using small infantry fire teams, which increased overall casualties relative to terrain gained,\" he explained.",
      "After almost two years of intense fighting, Russian forces seized the logistical hub of Vuhledar in Donetsk on 1 October 2024.",
      "According to estimates by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), from September to November 2024, Russian forces captured 2,356 square kilometres of Ukraine.",
      "Even then, Ukrainian forces at the front did not collapse.",
      "The cost of this advance was at least 11,678 Russian military deaths.",
      "Actual losses figures are likely higher. We have only accounted for soldiers and officers whose names appeared in publicly available obituaries and whose dates of death or funeral fell within this period.",
      "Overall in 2024, according to ISW, Russia captured 4,168 square kilometres of land.",
      "If we assume that our figure of 45,287 confirmed deaths in 2024 is about 40% of the full number, then the total number would be closer to 112,000 fatalities last year.",
      "This means that for each square kilometre captured, 27 Russian soldiers were killed, and this does not include the wounded.",
      "How losses are changing recruitment",
      "Russia has found ways of replenishing its depleted forces.",
      "\"Russian recruitment also increased in the second half of 2024 and exceeded Russian casualties, allowing Moscow to generate additional formations,\" says Michael Kofman.",
      "One-time payments to soldiers signing new contracts were increased in three Russian regions. Combat salaries for volunteer soldiers are five to seven times higher than the average wage in most regions.",
      "We also class as volunteers those who signed up to avoid criminal prosecution, which was allowed by law in 2024.",
      "Volunteers have become the fastest-growing category of casualties in our calculations, making up a quarter of those we have identified.",
      "In 2023-2024, thousands of volunteers who signed contracts with the Ministry of Defence were sent to the front lines only 10\u201314 days later. Such minimal training will have dramatically reduced their chances of survival, experts say.",
      "One Russian republic, Bashkortostan, has seen the highest numbers of casualties, with 4,836 confirmed deaths. Most were from rural areas and 38% had gone to fight with no military experience.",
      "The one-time payment for signing a Russian army contract in Ufa is 34 times the region's average salary of 67,575 rubles (\u00a3600).",
      "Calculating deaths from open source data will always be incomplete.",
      "This is because the bodies of a significant number of soldiers killed in the past months may still be on the battlefield and retrieving them presents a risk to serving soldiers.",
      "The true death toll for Russian forces increases significantly, if you include those who fought against Ukraine as part of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.",
      "An assessment of obituaries and reports of searches for fighters who have lost contact suggests between 21,000 and 23,500 people may have been killed by September 2024.",
      "That would bring the total number of fatalities to 185,000 to 260,700 military personnel.",
      "CLARIFICATION 5 May 2025: This story has been updated to make it clear that the figure of 27 losses per sq km is based on an estimated number of deaths last year of about 112,000."

      "That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.",
      "Since then, dozens of other people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all the claims.",

    "summary": "The find could shed light on how Indians lived 1,000 years ago - but is without a museum because of red tape.",
    "story": [
      "A 1,000 year-old human skeleton buried sitting cross-legged in India is still without a museum to house it because of bureaucratic wrangling, six years after it was unearthed.",
      "Archaeologist Abhijit Ambekar made the significant discovery in 2019, when he spotted what looked like the top of a human skull while excavating in western Gujarat state.",
      "As his team dug deeper, they found the well-preserved remains in a pit in what appeared to be a meditative posture. Similar remains have been found at only three other sites in India.",
      "But officials are still arguing over who should take charge of the skeleton. It remains in a makeshift shelter \u2013 not far from a new museum of local archaeology.",
      "Abhijit Ambekar says the skeleton - found in the town of Vadnagar - is likely to belong to the Solanki period. The Solanki dynasty, also known as the Chaulukya dynasty, ruled over parts of modern-day Gujarat between 940 to 1300 CE.",
      "The skeleton's right arm rested on its lap and its left arm lay suspended in the air, as if resting on a stick.",
      "\"The skeleton is an extremely valuable find, not just for Vadnagar but for the whole country. It can help us understand how our ancestors lived, and reveal details about the past that are yet unknown,\" says Dr Ambekar, who heads the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) division in Mumbai, and led the team that found the skeleton.",
      "That it is yet to find a proper resting place, despite its archaeological significance, appears to come down to red tape.",
      "Mr Ambekar says the Gujarat government's plan for all artefacts excavated from Vadnagar was to place them in local museums.",
      "He says around 9,000 artefacts, including the skeleton, that were excavated from Vadnagar between 2016 and 2022 by the ASI and had been handed over to the Gujarat government have been placed in local museums - except for the skeleton.",
      "However, the state government says the skeleton is still in the possession of the ASI.",
      "\"As proper process was not followed, it [the skeleton] was not placed in the museum,\" Pankaj Sharma, director of the state's Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, told the BBC.",
      "Yadubir Singh Rawat, director general of the ASI, did not respond to the BBC's questions on the matter.",
      "M Thennarasan, principal secretary of the state's Sports, Youth and Cultural Activities Department told the BBC, that authorities were working on shifting the skeleton to a museum as soon as possible.",
      "Excavating the skeleton was a time-consuming process, Mr Ambekar says, adding that it took two months to complete. Various tools were used to carefully brush the soil away and free the skeleton from its ancient grave.",
      "It is currently housed in a tarpaulin shelter in Vadnagar, unprotected by security guards and exposed to natural elements. Locals sometimes bring relatives and friends to see the skeleton - a curiosity that has put a spotlight on the town, which is also the birthplace of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "What's interesting is that just a short distance away is the new Archaeological Experiential Museum - inaugurated by India's home minister in January.",
      "According to a government press release, the museum has been built at a cost of $35m and is spread across 12,500 sq m. It boasts that it showcases \"Vadnagar's 2,500-year-old history with over 5,000 artefacts, including ceramics, coins, tools and skeletal remains\".",
      "While the museum has a massive framed photo of the skeleton, it does not house the actual remains.",
      "Vadnagar is a historically significant region in Gujarat and excavations by the ASI have found traces of human settlements dating back to more than 2,000 years ago. Mr Ambekar says that portions of an earthen rampart believed to have been built by the region's first settlers exists even today.",
      "Digs have also revealed remnants of ancient Buddhist monasteries and stupas. These findings and others \u2013 such as terracotta figurines, coins, shell jewellery and stone and copper plate inscriptions - have helped archaeologists establish seven cultural sequences or phases in the area, starting from around the 2nd Century BCE and dating all the way up to the 19th Century CE.",
      "Mr Ambekar says the age of the skeleton he and his team found was estimated based on a DNA analysis of its teeth and a stratigraphic study of the excavation site. Stratigraphy involves studying rock sediments or layers of earth to determine their age. This is then used to establish the chronology of historical events or the approximate age of artefacts.",
      "\"The DNA analysis tells us that the skeleton is of local ancestry and belongs to a man in his forties, but more studies need to be done to understand his diet and lifestyle, which will in turn give us a better understanding of the region as it existed 1,000 years ago,\" he says.",
      "It could also shed light on the phenomenon of \"samadhi burials\" - an ancient burial practice among Hindus where revered figures were buried instead of being cremated, Mr Ambekar says.",
      "He adds that the skeleton had managed to survive the passage of time because the soil around it had remained undisturbed and displayed characteristics that prevent skeletal decay.",
      "Extricating the skeleton from the site and moving it to its current location was not an easy task. First, a block of earth with the skeleton nestled inside was cut out from the soil surrounding it. The skeleton and soil were treated with different chemicals to consolidate their structures. The block of earth was then put into a wooden box filled with wet mud and a crane was used to move the box to its current site.",
      "The entire operation took six days to complete, says Mr Ambekar.",
      "He hopes that the skeleton will find a place in a museum soon. But he adds it will need to have mechanisms to control the temperature and humidity of the space to prevent the skeleton from decomposing.",
      "Locals the BBC spoke to expressed similar sentiments and blamed \"red tapeism\" for the back-and-forth over the skeleton.",
      "\"We are proud of Vadnagar's ancient history but this treatment of a 1,000-year-old skeleton is deeply concerning. What is the point of building a museum if the most unique antiquity is left outside under a plastic roof?\" Vadnagar resident Jesang Thakor said.",
      "Another resident, Bethaji Thakor, said that he believed the skeleton could draw tourists from around the world to Vadnagar.",
      "\"Where else will you get to see something like this?\""

    "story": [
      "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.",
      "With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.",
      "\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.",
      "His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.",
      "\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.",
      "The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.",
      "Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.",
      "Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.",
      "Mr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.",

      "His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.",
      "\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.",
      "These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.",
      "\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.",

      "One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.",
      "EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.",
      "Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.",
      "And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.",
      "\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.",
      "For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.",
      "\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.",
      "This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.",
      "\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"",
      "By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.",
      "While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.",
      "For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.",
      "One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.",
      "The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.",
      "But it says good community relations are not enough.",
      "\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"",
      "On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.",

      "His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.",
      "Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.",
      "The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.",
      "While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark."

    "story": [
      "Ahead of Sweden's Walpurgis festival to mark the start of spring, young people were busy selecting outfits or getting their hair done. Not all of them made it there alive.",
      "At a hair salon in Uppsala, a city north of Stockholm, three young men who police say were aged between 15 and 20 were shot dead on Tuesday before the celebrations started.",
      "The horror left many shaken in the build-up to the festival, known as Valborg in Swedish, which is typically a convivial affair each 30 April on the eve of the Christian feast day of Saint Walpurga. Celebrated nationwide, Uppsala hosts the country's largest and most high-profile Walpurgis events, popular with students.",
      "The partying did go ahead in full swing, but a subtle heaviness hung over the Swedish blue and yellow flags which fluttered around the city.",
      "And now, with the festival finished, it's only police tape - not flags - fluttering outside the basement barber shop where the shooting took place close to Vaksala Square.",
      "'I knew something had happened'",
      "\"It's really sad,\" says 20-year-old student Yamen Alchoum, who is in the area to eat at a nearby food truck. He says he was at another barber shop on the night of the shootings, but previously had his hair cut at this salon multiple times. \"I think if I was there [on Tuesday]\u2026I would be, like, involved in the shooting. And it's a bit scary.\"",
      "According to witnesses speaking to Swedish media TV4 and Aftonbladet, two of the young victims were dressed in barber capes and sat in parlour chairs when they were shot in the head just after 5pm on Tuesday.",
      "The city centre was busy at the time as commuters made their way to the nearby train station and students from the city's prestigious university cycled back to their flats.",
      "Witnesses reported hearing loud bangs which many mistook for fireworks. Minutes later several police cars and an ambulance arrived, blocking the street and forcing a bus to turn around. Helicopters and drones were dispatched to try and track down the suspect. Local media reported that he had worn a mask and used an electric scooter to get away from the scene.",
      "\"I heard the helicopters, so then I knew that something had happened,\" says Sara, a 32-year-old who lives on the street. She says her phone quickly lit up with news notifications and texts from friends asking if she was okay.",
      "Around two hours after the shootings, police arrested a 16-year-old boy. In Sweden, suspects can be held based on different levels of suspicion, and the teenager was initially held at the second-highest level, indicating strong suspicion.",
      "However, by Friday, prosecutors said the case against him had weakened and he was released.",
      "On Saturday, Swedish police confirmed that six people have now been arrested in connection with the case. The suspects range in age from under 18 to 45, according to the state prosecutor's office, and one is suspected of carrying out the killings.",
      "People intending to visit Uppsala for the Walpurgis festival were advised not to change their plans, as police promised extra resources on the cathedral city's streets and suggested the shooting was likely an \"isolated incident\".",
      "While many were shaken, tens of thousands of Swedes still heeded their advice, packing the banks of Uppsala's Fyris river to watch the annual student raft race, drinking in the city's pubs and parks or heading to a huge public bonfire in the evening. Others joined the annual spring ceremony outside the university where current and former students gathered to wave white caps.",
      "\"I don't really feel so scared,\" says Alvin Rose, 19, a social studies student, having a snack in Vaksala Square, just around the corner from where the shootings happened. \"It feels like there's more security, more cops about.\"",
      "His friend Kassandra Fritz, an 18-year-old natural sciences student, says she has driven to Uppsala from her home in G\u00e4vle, two hours north, to \"have fun and meet new people\".",
      "She reflects that she no longer has a \"strong\" reaction to news about shootings in Sweden since they are frequently in the headlines. \"There's been so many shootings lately, not only here in Uppsala but like, everywhere in Sweden.\"",
      "A hotspot for gun violence",
      "Over the past decade, Sweden has emerged as a European hotspot for gun crime, often linked to criminal networks. Research for Sweden's National Council for Crime Prevention released last year concluded that the profile of perpetrators is \"increasingly younger\", with growing numbers of teenagers both carrying out or dying from gun violence.",
      "Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson was on a work trip to Valencia when the Uppsala shooting took place, but has since described it as \"an extremely violent act\".",
      "\"This underlines that the wave of violence is not over - it continues,\" he said in an interview with Swedish news agency TT on Wednesday.",
      "At a news conference the day after, officers said they were investigating the possibility that the deaths were linked to gang crime, but said it was too soon to confirm this.",
      "Police in various Swedish cities have previously said it is becoming more common for gangs to contract vulnerable children to carry out crimes, because those who are 15 or younger are below the age of criminal responsibility in Sweden.",
      "Sweden's government recently proposed controversial new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children, in an attempt to prevent them from being recruited to teenage gangs.",
      "Ministers have also said they want to tighten the country's gun laws.",
      "In February, 10 people were killed in the country's worst mass shooting at an adult education centre in the Swedish town of Orebro. In this case, police suspect a 35-year-old was behind the killings. He legally owned a weapon, and was found dead inside the building.",
      "Tributes and tears",
      "Outside the hair salon in Uppsala, 20-year-old Yamen says he has never been involved in gang crime but knows plenty of others who have.",
      "\"Many times in my school, there was gang violence, and in the streets - dealers,\" he says. \"But my personality was to work, study, and now I am in college.\"",
      "As he leaves to meet friends, a steady stream of young people continue to stop at the street corner next to the hairdressers, some bringing bouquets of flowers. Several appear visibly shaken and have tears in their eyes.",
      "\"I knew him very well,\" says Elias, a 16-year-old who says he was friends with one of the victims, and has asked the BBC not to share his surname. \"It feels unreal, you know. It doesn't feel like I've truly accepted the situation.\"",

    "story": [
      "In 2020, at the height of the Covid pandemic, Guillaume Broche was like millions of others around the world.",
      "\"Bored in their job and wanting to do something different.\"",
      "Working for French gaming giant Ubisoft at the time, he had an idea for his own project - a role-playing game inspired by one of his childhood favourites, the classic Japanese series Final Fantasy.",
      "That would become Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 which, five years later, has become a sensation.",
      "It sold one million copies in just three days, topped Spotify viral charts with its soundtrack, and even won praise from French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "But one of the most remarkable things about it is the story of how it was made - a tale of random Reddit messages, \"massive luck\" and an unusual approach to game development.",
      "Expedition 33 is set in Lumiere, a fictional world overshadowed by a huge monolith bearing a glowing numeral on its face.",
      "Each year an entity known as The Paintress emerges and lowers the number by one, causing everyone of that age to vanish, and the game follows a group on a quest to destroy the mysterious being.",
      "It's an intriguing set-up for an epic tale, but the game's aesthetic, inspired by 19th-Century France, and its old-school turn-based battles also set it apart.",
      "But the conventional wisdom when Guillaume began was that players didn't want something like that.",
      "So, five years ago, he started to recruit people for his passion project, firing out messages on Reddit and online forums to potential colleagues.",
      "One of those who responded was Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, who was under lockdown in Australia at the time.",
      "\"I saw a post on Reddit by Guillaume asking for voice actors to record something for free for a demo,\" she says.",
      "\"I was like: 'I've never done that, it sounds kinda cool', so I sent him an audition.\"",
      "Jennifer was originally cast as a major character in an early version of the game, but eventually switched roles to become the team's lead writer.",
      "Guillaume eventually left Ubisoft and formed Sandfall Interactive to work on Clair Obscur full-time from its base in Montpellier, France.",
      "After securing funding from publisher Kepler Interactive, the core team grew to about 30 people.",
      "Many of them were found in a similar, unusual manner to Jennifer.",
      "Composer Lorien Testard - who had never worked on a video game before - was discovered via posts on music-sharing website Soundcloud.",
      "\"I call this the Guillaume effect. He's very good at finding really cool people,\" says Jennifer.",
      "Guillaume more modestly attributes his success rate to Covid - people looking for a creative outlet - and also \"massive luck\".",
      "\"It's always the same story,\" he says.",
      "\"I have a list of 15 people to contact and I'm like: 'Okay I'm probably going to get maybe no one at all'.",
      "\"And every time the first one is like: 'Yeah, let's do it'.\"",
      "But Guillaume does admit that he targeted people who seemed to be \"in line with the direction\" he wanted to take the project.",
      "\"Lorien, when we discussed the game for the first time, we had exactly the same references,\" he says.",

      "Expedition 33 has also been widely praised for its production values - rivalling those of games worked on by hundreds, even thousands of staff.",
      "Guillaume attributes some of this to recent advances in tools used to make games, which allowed the team to work more efficiently.",
      "Having the backing of Kepler allowed the studio to attract actors including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Lord of the Rings star Andy Serkis, and video game actors Jennifer English and Ben Starr.",

    "summary": "As Western alliances unravel, Europe is entering an era that seems distant from what VE Day represented, the BBC's Katya Adler writes.",
    "story": [
      "\"Celebration? What celebration? It feels more like a funeral\" - the damning words of a former senior Nato figure to describe this week's ceremonies marking Victory in Europe Day.",
      "The top-level diplomat who spent years at the transatlantic defence alliance asked not to be named in order to speak freely, but why so nihilistic? VE Day was a joint Allied triumph over Nazi Germany; over hatred, dictatorship, the Third Reich's territorial expansionism and heinous crimes against humanity.",
      "So much blood was spilled achieving that victory. Some 51 million Allied soldiers and civilians died during World War Two, united in a pursuit to rid the world of the scourge of Nazism.",
      "But 80 years on, we're surrounded by countless news and academic analyses breathlessly singling out Donald Trump as the modern day nail in the coffin of the strong transatlantic bonds forged back then. In Europe, the American president is viewed by many as the slayer-in-chief of decades-old common values; shared visions of security, democracy and rule of law.",
      "But is that accurate, or too simplistic?",
      "Russia - divisions from the start",
      "To get the full picture on what happened to allied ties after WW2, we cannot omit Russia, then or now.",
      "By 1945, about 24 million Russians and other Soviets had been slaughtered in the war with Germany. Without their sacrifice, as well as that of the other allies, the Nazis would not have been vanquished.",
      "\"One thing we need to recognise, though, is Russia was never a true friend of the West,\" says Michael Zantovsky, a former Czech Ambassador to Washington and to London.",
      "\"During WW2 it was an ally for existential reasons. It needed any help [against the Nazis] that it could get. And it was the same story with western powers, to be fair. They needed the help of the Soviet Union. But Russia did not plan on continuing the alliance after the war. As soon as the threat of Nazi Germany was destroyed, the Soviet Union intended to follow its own objectives.\"",
      "Splits appeared the moment Germany was defeated; there was even a disagreement over which day VE Day fell. Western powers witnessed the signing of Germany's military capitulation in the French cathedral city of Reims, news that broke on 8 May 1945. The USSR wanted its own, separate, signing with surrendering Germany in Soviet-occupied Berlin a day later. Russia marks VE Day on 9 May to this day.",
      "Depending where you are in Europe on VE Day, the mood is varied - particularly this year.",
      "Western Europe welcomes liberty, democracy and an end to the Nazi threat. In the UK for example, multiple VE Day celebrations are planned this year, as with every year.",
      "But people living in central and eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, emerged from Nazi occupation in 1945 only to end up under Communist regimes - whether they liked it or not.",
      "As a result, Ambassador Zantovsky describes his country's relationship to VE Day as \"ambiguous\".",
      "\"The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by US troops, the rest of the country by Soviet soldiers,\" he tells me.",
      "Czechoslovakia was taken over by the Communist Party in 1948 and fully invaded by the Soviet Union two decades later. \"During communist times, the West's role in WW2 was deliberately suppressed and marginalised. We were told we owed our liberty [from the Nazis] to the Soviets.\"",
      "Russia marks VE Day with triumphalist military parades - and President Vladimir Putin knows the deep sense of nationalist pride that Russians still feel at defeating the Nazi regime in 1945. It is no coincidence that he publicly labels Ukraine's leadership \"Nazis\" as a means of besmirching them in Russian eyes.",
      "For VE Day this year, President Putin called a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine \u2013 it's presumed, because he wants to concentrate, uninterrupted, on showing off Russia's military muscle in front of a crowd of foreign dignitaries, including President Xi Jinping of China.",
      "The official reason Putin gave for the Ukraine ceasefire was \"humanitarian grounds\". Quite the irony, since he's the one who ordered the invasion of that sovereign country.",
      "That invasion brought back difficult memories for Czechs of their own occupation and suppression. \"That's why we feel so strongly for Ukraine,\" says Zantovsky.",
      "\"It's only a few hundred kilometres away. Our sense of security is threatened once again.\"",
      "The US - a marriage of convenience",
      "This is why most Europeans are so shocked at President Trump's apparent respect for, even deference towards, Putin, while simultaneously verbally threatening the territorial integrity of traditionally close allies like Canada and Denmark.",
      "Europe has viewed the US as its closest friend since WW2. Washington poured money into the war-shattered continent in the late 1940s - including West Germany, which was ever thankful to the US for bringing it back into the fold after the horrors of Nazism. The US also gave Europe post-war security guarantees; Nato was founded in 1949.",
      "But this wasn't American altruism, as Trump implies. It too was a marriage of convenience, of sorts.",
      "Following WW2, the US worried about the spread of communism. It fretted that Europe, with its economy and infrastructure in tatters, was vulnerable both to home-grown communist parties and abroad from an expansionist Soviet Union. By swooping in to help rebuild Europe, the US was gaining a geostrategic foothold on the Soviet Union's doorstep throughout the Cold War.",
      "The idea of a \"West\" - made of countries sharing security goals and values - was born.",
      "Might we now be witnessing its death, or gradual strangulation? With no common enemy anymore, the friendship is certainly fraying. In 2025, the president of the United States no longer feels threatened by Russia.",
      "\"Shared history served as the foundation for the (transatlantic) relationship for eight decades, but it's not enough to propel the relationship forward anymore,\" Washington's former Nato ambassador Julie Smith told me.",
      "The war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since WW2. With Russia's economy resolutely on a war footing, it has the potential to spread.",
      "Europe, unlike the US, still feels threatened by Russia. Capitals across the continent have been left speechless and nervous by Trump appearing to blame Ukraine, not Moscow, for the bloodshed.",
      "The televised press conference in the White House Oval Office in late February, where Trump and his deputy, JD Vance, seemingly tried to bait, berate and humiliate Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a turning point in European public opinion and politics.",
      "A YouGov poll in March indicated that, 80 years on from VE Day, a large majority of Western Europeans (78% in the UK, 74% in Germany, 75% in Spain) now view the White House as a big threat to peace and security in Europe.",
      "In Europe's east, the Soviet Union's former sphere of influence, people fear President Trump's attitude to Ukraine will only embolden President Putin in his expansionist drive.",
      "If Russia gets US recognition for \"crimes of conquest\" in Ukraine, says historian and author Timothy Garton Ash, VE Day this year would be better labelled DE Day - Defeat in Europe Day.",
      "And with Trump frequently accusing Europe of free-loading, and taking advantage of the US, there's a nervousness among leaders across the continent that they could be left alone to defend themselves for the first time since WW2. Boosting defence spending is now a huge topic in European capitals.",
      "Germany decides to leave history in the past and rebuild its military",
      "How ordinary Poles are preparing for a Russian invasion",
      "'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'? Trump voters reflect on 100 days",
      "The message Berlin has taken from Trump's first 100 days in office is: \"We cannot rely on the US anymore,\" says Peter Wittig, Germany's former ambassador to Washington.",
      "That's a massive turnaround for Germans, who have been reluctant to rebuild their country's military might after WW2. Instead, Germany leant particularly heavily on the US for its security. A large chunk of the estimated 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe are based in Germany. The US stores nuclear arms in the country too.",
      "The Trump-shock among normally pro-US German politicians is so profound that it prompted a change in the country's constitution this spring. Parliamentarians voted to lift Berlin's long established debt brake - which limited government spending - in order to invest heavily and power up the country's military going forward.",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, once Germany's defence minister, is now the president of the European Commission in Brussels. She is transatlantic-leaning and carefully-spoken, but even she summed up the present situation starkly: \"The West as we knew it, no longer exists.\"",
      "'The end of an era' - but what now?",
      "Still, the pivot away from Europe by the US cannot just be blamed on Trump.",
      "China, not Russia, has been viewed by the White House as strategic threat number one for some time now. In 2012, then-US President Barack Obama said he wanted to focus his foreign policy on Asia, and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden invested a lot of time trying to shore up China-wary allies in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "Trump or no Trump, concentrating foreign policy on Asia and withdrawing substantially from Europe is unlikely to change, says Ambassador Wittig - whichever political party wins the next US election - especially as there is now a growing reluctance in US public opinion to carry the burden of financing allies.",
      "Wittig calls it \"the end of an era - the end of engagement in Europe\".",
      "Despite all the European hand wringing, there is a recognition among the continent's leaders that, 80 years after VE Day, it is high time they take more responsibility for paying and providing for their own defence capabilities, rather than relying on Washington.",
      "Some also see potential in the relationship reset. Ambassador Zantovsky calls this \"an opportunity brought about by crisis, a sense of urgency regarding security that hasn't existed [in Europe] for the last 30 years\".",
      "Perhaps, but during the Cold War western European societies had younger populations and far more slim-line welfare states. Spending 4% or 5% of gross domestic product on defence was do-able.",
      "Analysts say that's what would be needed again now to wean Europe off US security support, but it's unclear if present-day voters would accept the painful compromises needed - in terms of cuts in government spending on health or education for example - in return for boosting their country's defence capabilities.",
      "This is especially the case in European nations geographically further from Russia's orbit, where the sense of immediate threat feels less acute.",
      "Mr Garton Ash wonders if there is a transitional path from the current US-led Nato to a more European Nato, with the US still at the table but Europe taking responsibility for its own security.",
      "\"We need a new generation of political leaders who are up to the challenge,\" says political historian and biographer Sir Anthony Seldon.",
      "\"A need can often bring forward the right people,\" he added, reflecting on European and US leaders in the aftermath of WW2.",
      "\"Something has certainly broken. The future is uncertain. Do we have to go to war periodically to realise how terrible it is, and to force us to work together?\"",

      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"Freak Offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"Freak Off.\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris made an appearance at the 2025 Met Gala on Monday, days after her anticipated return to the public stage, where she delivered her first major speech since\u00a0losing the 2024 presidential election.",
      "It was Harris' first time at the benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. In an interview with Vogue published ahead of the blue carpet event, Harris emphasized the importance of art and how it intertwines with politics.",
      "\"Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,\" Harris told Vogue. \"Artistic expression \u2014 whether it's dance, music, visual arts or fashion \u2014 has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.\"",
      "To embrace the 2025 Met Gala theme, inspired by the Met's exhibit \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" the former vice president wore a black-and-white Off-White gown designed by the brand's creative director IB Kamara, according to Vogue. Harris attended with her husband, Doug Emhoff, Vogue said.",
      "While politicians are no strangers to the Met Gala, many of them have been local New York City lawmakers in recent years, including Mayor Eric Adams and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In 2022, Hillary Clinton returned to fashion's biggest night 21 years after her debut. And in 1977, Ronald Reagan attended the Met Gala between his terms as governor of California and president of the United States.",
      "Harris may be eyeing a political return of her own.",
      "Speaking in San Francisco last week, in her first major public remarks since her 2024 presidential defeat, Harris blasted President Trump's economic agenda, including his tariffs. She also suggested she's been having conversations about her future, as California prepares to elect its next governor in 2026 and Democrats search for a presidential candidate to run in 2028.",
      "\"Everybody is asking me, 'Well, what've you been thinking about these days,'\" she said.",
      "Sources familiar with Harris' thinking told CBS News she's weighing a gubernatorial bid in her home state, a third run for the presidency or not seeking elected office.",

Rio's metro employees danced to Lady Gaga's 2008 hit song \"LoveGame\" and gave instructions for Saturday in a video. A free exhibition celebrating her career sold out.",

The dress code of the 2025 Met Gala \u2014 typically related to the exhibit's theme \u2014 is \"Tailored for You,\" calling for a focus on suiting and menswear, according to the Met.

      "2024 Met Gala theme: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\"",
      "In 2024, the Met Gala explored the themes of rebirth and renewal through nature and the passage of time. Referencing the 1962 J.G. Ballard short story \"The Garden of Time\" celebrities, entrepreneurs, athletes and designers wore floral gowns and referenced nature's everlasting forms.",
      "Bad Bunny wore Margiela and Jennifer Lopez wore a Schiaparelli design. Both co-chaired the event with Wintour, who wore a Loewe custom floor-length jacket adorned in feathers that formed tulip bouquets. But Zendaya, another gala co-chair, stole the night by walking the carpet twice. She first wore Maison Margiela Artisanal by John Galliano before changing quickly and closing out the most public part of the night, the strut into the event at the steps of the Met, in a 1996 black gown from John Galliano's Givenchy era, which she paired with a flower bouquet Alexander McQueen head piece designed by Philip Treacy.",
      "2023 Met Gala theme: \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\"",
      "The Met Gala honored the late designer Karl Lagerfeld in 2023 with a night of references to his style and his immense influence in the fashion world. Some wore Lagerfeld's designs for Chanel, Fendi, Balmain and Chlo\u00e9, while others twisted his unique way of dressing, which combined black, white and leather for his daily wear, and later in life inspired the creative behind his eponymous label. There were also plenty of cat odes at the gala, a tribute to Lagerfeld's beloved feline friend Choupette,",
      "2022 Met Gala theme: \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\"",
      "The second installment of a two-part exhibition on fashion in the United States, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\" celebrated two centuries of American identity through fashion's eyes. \"Gilded Glamour\" graced the gala's red carpet and American history references were prevalent.",
      "The most recognized garment belonged to Marilyn Monroe. The nude, form-fitting number shined on the style icon while she serenaded then-president John F. Kennedy for his birthday in 1962. Kim Kardashian wore the dress after entering a deal with the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum to bring the garment out of its display. The uproar was immediate, as some alleged possible damage to the dress. Ripley's was forced to respond\u00a0denying the heated claims.",
      "2021 Met Gala theme: \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\"",
      "The first of two parts, \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\" wove together identities of the ever-changing U.S. through time, exploring the emotions behind the country's evolving culture. Instagram sponsored the event and brought to the carpet executives turned celebrities, including author, viral influencer and director of fashion partnerships at Instagram Evan Chen, and the social app's chief Adam Mosseri.",
      "After a pause for the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, social hesitance was still evident and masks were incorporated into some of the night's designs. Of note, Billie Eilish wore an Oscar De La Renta dress for a cause, calling for the storied house to end its ties to fur.",
      "2019 Met Gala theme: \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\"",
      "Guests brought their imagination to the pink carpet for the 2019 \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" gala rendition. Gender-bending was evident\u00a0and many looks turned heads, like Jared Leto's interpretation of Alessandro Michele's world of Gucci. Lady Gaga's iconic Brandon Maxwell looks told a story of style with each step the singer took outside of the Met. Framed around Susan Sontag's 1964 essay \"Notes on 'Camp,'\" the gala brought to life the whimsical and effervescent nature of fashion.",
      "2018 Met Gala theme: \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\"",
      "The 2018 Met Gala theme drew inspiration from Catholicism. \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" explored religious iconography and the influence of medieval art in fashion. Guests brought to life looks that referenced papal garments and displayed biblical artifacts like crosses, angel wings and halos. The theme's ties to the history of Christ were not well received by some critics who thought fashion should stay out of the church.",
      "2017 Met Gala theme: \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art of the In-Between\"",
      "The 2017 event paid tribute to Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and her Comme des Gar\u00e7ons avant-garde designs that play with the body's shape and form. Duality, a motif for the exhibit, highlighted almost four decades of her work. Guests brought to the event pops of red from Kawakubo's palette, intricate embellishments and sheer fabrics. Caroline Kennedy and Rihanna embraced more fantastical designs, pairing shape-shifting silhouettes with florals, inducing more authenticity to a much-subdued theme interpretation.",
      "2016 Met Gala theme: \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\"",
      "The influence of technology in fashion turned the 2016 Met Gala into a spectacular display of metallics and cutting-edge designs. Many of the garnmets appeared too intricate and precise to be man-made, an ode to the artisans all over the world who piece together exquisite Haute Couture creations by pouring thousands of hours into each work. CBS News spent the day with supermodel and entrepreneur Karlie Kloss, who wore a sleek white Brandon Maxwell number that referenced classic men's tailoring paired with Ala\u00efa-esque angular cuts.",
      "2015 Met Gala theme \"China: Through the Looking Glass\"",
      "While the 2015 Met exhibit scoped a wide history of artifacts and influence from Asian art, the gala came down to just one word: Rihanna. Dawning a sunny yellow cape that cascaded down the steps of the Met, the singer and fashion icon elevated the meaning of attending fashion's biggest night. The couture garment designed by China's Guo Pei took two years to make, Rihanna told Vanity Fair. The look quickly comes to mind around the world when the first Monday in May is discussed.",
      "2014 Met Gala theme: \"Charles James: Beyond Fashion\"",
      "The Costume Institute has been celebrating those behind fashion since its inception, and in 1973 it began hosting the gala within the museum itself, Vogue recounts. Fashion authority Diana Vreeland brought to life \"The World of Balenciaga\" after exiting Vogue as editor-in-chief, and her tribute to Spanish designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga left a blueprint for other designer-centered celebrations that followed.",
      "In 2014, couturier Charles James' work went on display at the Met and guests embraced brilliant gowns with his grandiose touch. James' tailored and structural approach to the female form, mixed with modern fabrics, brought elegance and regalia to the occasion.",
      "2013 Met Gala theme: \"Punk: Chaos to Couture\"",
      "Anti-establishment influence inked its way into the Met's\u00a0history in 2013.\u00a0Started in the 1970's, the punk movement gave guests a reason to wear garments embellished with the spirit of teen disobedience and air of grungy D.I.Y. personal style. Madonna honored the era with fishnets, metal studs and silver chains adorning a Givenchy mini plaid blazer by Riccardo Tisci. Rebellion was also apparent in the hairstyles exhibited, most notably by singer Miley Cyrus, a fashion fanatic, whose short, spiked look paired perfectly with her risque fishnet Marc Jacobs gown.",
      "What was the first Met Gala theme?",
      "The Costume Institute started holding benefits in 1948, but it was Vreeland who brought themed galas to the next level as a Met consultant with \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, according to Vogue.",
      "Full list of past Met Gala themes over the years",

    "summary": "The actor-playwright received two Tony nominations for the over-the-top comedy about Mary Todd Lincoln and her secret passion of becoming a cabaret star, while her husband, Abe, is trying to win the Civil War.",
    "story": [
      "\"Oh, Mary!\" may be Broadway's most unlikely offering this season, a wildly over-the-top, not-at-all historically accurate look at first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, written by and starring Cole Escola.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"For God's sake, Mary! How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting about a stage right now in the ruins of war?\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"How would it look? Sensational!!\"",
      "It's a broad comedy about Mary's secret passion of becoming a cabaret star. Meanwhile, her husband, Abe, is just wrapping up the Civil War, and is more concerned with keeping the country together.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"No! It's inappropriate! We're at war!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"With who?\"Abraham Lincoln: \"The south!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"Of what?\"",
      "It's not a revival, it has no movie stars (\"Well, speak for yourself, Mo!\"), and it's a smash hit, breaking box office records.",
      "What does that say? \"Inflation is high,\" Escola laughed.",
      "Escola came up with the idea in 2009: \"I sent an email to myself that said, 'What if Abraham Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing for Mary Todd?' You know, like, Mary's starting over. Like, 'Now I'm single. I can date.' You know?\"",
      "But this fever dream Mary remained just a dream for years. \"I loved this idea so much, I didn't want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me \u2013 to disappoint me, not just the audience, but, like, me,\" Escola said. \"There are certain ideas that you're just like, 'Oh, I don't wanna plant this seed, because what if it's an ugly flower?'\"",
      "Escola eventually wrote the play. \"Oh, Mary!\" opened to rapturous reviews downtown, quickly moved uptown to Broadway, and just this week earned five Tony nominations, including two for 38-year-old Escola (for best play and best actor).",
      "It's all a long way from rural Oregon, where Escola was raised. The family had little money, with a Vietnam veteran father, Escola says, who suffered from mental illness. \"When I was maybe five years old, my father chased us out of the home with a shotgun. He was having some sort of alcoholic manic break and thought that there were people after him. And so, he chased my mother and my brother and I out of the trailer, and then we moved out and didn't come back.\"",
      "The family moved in with Escola's grandmother. \"Then, her and I shared a bedroom, and I remember that's when she taught me to read. And she was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's so she would repeat stories a lot. But I loved them. I loved her stories. I realize now, when she would tell these stories, we were, like, meeting in the middle of her memory. Like, she was living out the fantasy of her childhood, and I was also living out my fantasy of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta.\"",
      "I asked, \"And you didn't mind that she was repeating the stories?\"",
      "\"No, no,\" Escola replied. \"Because she would remember certain details in a new telling or, like, leave something out, and then I got to be, like, you know, 'And you were wearing a dress, right, Gramma?'\"",
      "\"And is it right that she gave you a Barbie when you were five?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She gave me my first Barbie. just completely took me at face value when I was doing something that wasn't what boys were supposed to do.\"",
      "Her understanding proved prescient. Escola now uses they/them pronouns. Asked to explain, Escola said, \"I have always felt not male, not female. And you know, it's funny, because recently I saw photos of me on Instagram. The comments were like, 'What is that? Like, that's not a man.' 'Well, it sure as hell ain't a woman, either.' And I was like, 'Exactly.' Like, you do get it.\"",
      "Likewise, Escola's comedic identity has never been in doubt.",
      "I asked, \"Comedically, have you always done your own thing?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"So, there was never a time where you thought, 'I need to be more like this person to make people respond to me'?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Escola. \"It would be like trying to speak German when I don't actually know any German. It has to make me laugh in order for it to even have a chance of making someone else laugh.\"",
      "Escola began performing in community theater back in Oregon, and eventually scraped together the money to make it to New York (\"It was New York or bust!\"), at first attending college and living at the 92nd Street Y. It was a short stint of only nine months. \"I had to drop out because they wouldn't let me take out any more loans. I guess I was so poor that they were like, 'You'll never be able to pay this back.'",
      "\"I felt like there was something wrong with me that I couldn't afford to go to school. That's the thing that makes me the most angry about being poor, just this innate sense that it's like a moral failing or an innate thing that's broken in you.\"",
      "Escola eventually did make it back to New York to stay, gaining a fan base with online videos, such as \"Mom Commercial\" (2015):",
      "\u2026 and then on TV, playing a range of deranged, yet delightful characters in shows like \"At Home with Amy Sedaris.\"",
      "And then along came Mary.",
      "I said, \"You don't come to see the show and go, 'Oh, there were layers and layers of development people that were saying, No, you've gotta tweak it for this audience and do this for that audience.'\"",
      "\"No,\" Escola said. \"There is something special about the fact that I wrote this for me and my friends, and for my audience that I've had in downtown venues and stuff. And the fact that it's successful is, I don't know, it makes it that much sweeter. It really does.\"",

    "summary": "When Alex Matisse founded East Fork Pottery, in Asheville, N.C., he didn't want to use the name of his great-grandfather, artist Henri Matisse. But after business took off, Alex decided it was time \u2013 and now graces his ceramics with the imagery of his famous forebear.",
    "story": [
      "As an apprentice to a potter, what Alex Matisse discovered shaped him like clay itself.\u00a0 \"When I walked in, I knew that this is what I was going to do,\" he said. \"We were told pots have skin and bones and skeletons and, like, a plate should have the fullness of the moon.\"",
      "Artful descriptions, much the way a painter might define their craft. In fact it was Henri Matisse who once said, \"I don't literally paint that table, but the emotion it produces upon me.\"",
      "When Alex founded East Fork Pottery in Asheville, North Carolina, back in 2009, he took the same view. He saw ceramics as a canvas. It came easily, like it was woven into his DNA \u2013 because it was. Alex is the great-grandson of artist Henri Matisse.",
      "I asked, \"What did you know of your great-grandfather when you were growing up?\"",
      "\"He was everywhere, kind of in the air that we breathed, around the house, on the walls,\" Alex replied.",
      "It was a famous last name he ran away from for years.\u00a0 \"I had a very grumpy relationship with it,\" he laughed. \"It was this kind of shadow thing that followed me around that I wanted to shake.\"",
      "Maybe it was stubbornness, or pride, but Alex was determined to make his own way. He convinced his soon-to-be-wife Connie to help him build a wood kiln on an old tobacco farm.",
      "I asked, \"Did she have the same passion for it that you did?\"",
      "\"No. She didn't have a passion for clay,\" Alex said.",
      "\"But she had a passion for you, so she kept going?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She stuck around,\" he laughed.",
      "And without anyone knowing who he really was, his business boomed. He could barely keep up with the demand. He realized, \"If we're gonna play in this world, something's gotta change. Like, we cannot keep doing it like we did.\"",
      "So, he decided to mechanize, at least partially. The pottery was still his, only he thought better, especially the colors.\u00a0 He was excited. \"And we sent out a postcard of these new pots that look, you know, they were plain, they had colors on them,\" he said. \"And nobody showed up. So overnight, we lost almost every single one of our customers. Like, they had thought we had lost our minds.\"",
      "And yet, he still refused to fall back on the Matisse name, and it turned out that belief in himself paid off.",
      "Today, he has legions of fans who call themselves \"Potheads.\" They buy, share and trade East Fork dinnerware online. On the secondary market, some of his early pieces can go for thousands of dollars.",
      "And so, with East Fork firmly established, about 18 months ago Alex decided it was time to use his own name. He, along with his sister and brother, poured over hundreds of works by their great-grandfather to find the ones that could be pottery perfect.",
      "\"We wanted something like the Blue Nude series that was instantly recognizable,\" Alex said. \"But then, I wanted some that spoke to me a little more personally.\"",
      "Decals were made of the chosen works, faithful to their great-grandfather's exacting details. Each one is carefully applied by hand, and inspected by hand over and over again.",
      "He says he doesn't wonder what his great-grandfather would think of his new collection. \"Oh, geez. No.\" Alex said, \"Because he was very serious. He was so focused on his work. Like, that's what he cared about.\"",
      "Henri Matisse once famously said, \"Creativity takes courage.\" His great-grandson Alex Matisse would certainly agree with that. His only caveat is that sometimes courage is all in the timing.",
      "\"There's not a heaviness to it,\" he said. \"It's just another layer. It's just another interesting part of my history, my family's history. And it feels great to celebrate it and share it.\"",

      "Sobule performed with such artists as Neil Young, Melissa Etheridge, Billy Bragg, Warren Zevon and Cyndi Lauper; appeared with \"SNL\" comedian Julia Sweeney in a stage show, \"Jill and Julia\"; and played herself performing a song on \"The Simpsons.\" She also starred in \"F*CK7thGrade,\" a 2022 autobiographical off-Broadway show described as \"a queer musical memoir\" that was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.",
      "Last month, in an interview with Cincy Music, Sobule was asked about the changes she has seen in the recording business during her career. \"The demise of the music industry as we once knew it, hasn't been great,\" she said. \"Thinking of the sad-ass checks from Spotify. But it has also made one become creative in other endeavors. For example, musical theater. I do tell my theater pals that I have moved on from the music industry, as I've been told off-Broadway theater is so lucrative. They just laugh.\""

      "Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, her agent Mike Eisenstadt said in a statement. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi's Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \"She wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\"",
      "Buzzi won a Golden Globe and was a two-time Emmy nominee for the NBC show that ran from 1968 to 1973. She was the only regular to appear in all six seasons, including the pilot.",
      "She was first spotted by \"Laugh-In\" creator and producer George Schlatter playing various characters on \"The Steve Allen Comedy Hour.\"",
      "Schlatter was holding auditions for \"Laugh-In\" when he received a picture in the mail of Buzzi in her Ormphby costume, sitting in a wire mesh trash barrel. The character was clad in drab brown with her bun covered by a hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead.",
      "\"I think I hired her because of my passion for Gladys Ormphby,\" he wrote in his 2023 memoir \"Still Laughing: A Life in Comedy.\" \"I must admit that the hairnet and the rolled-down stockings did light my fire. My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.\"",
      "The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On \"Laugh-In,\" her most frequent target was Arte Johnson's dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh.",
      "\"Gladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,\" Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. \"So when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who's been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused. And that's almost everyone at some time or other.\"",

      "Born Ruth Ann Buzzi on July 24, 1936, in Westerly, Rhode Island, she was the daughter of Angelo Buzzi, a nationally known stone sculptor. Her father and later her brother operated Buzzi Memorials, a gravestone and monument maker in Stonington, Connecticut, where she was head cheerleader in high school.",
      "Buzzi enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse at age 17. Two years later, she traveled with singer Rudy Vallee in a musical and comedy act during her summer break. That earned her an Actors' Equity union card before she graduated from the playhouse's College of Theatre Arts.",
      "Buzzi moved to New York and was immediately hired for a lead role in an off-Broadway musical revue, the first of 19 such shows she performed in on the East Coast.",
      "She got her national television break on \"The Garry Moore Show\" in 1964, just after Carol Burnett was replaced by Dorothy Loudon on the series. She played Shakundala the Silent, a bumbling magician's assistant to Dom DeLuise's character Dominic the Great.",

      "A spokesperson for the NIH did not comment on why NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya sought the additional layoffs, referring an inquiry to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. An HHS spokesperson said that, after a review, the department had notified additional employees that they were \"also impacted\" by the layoffs plan announced in March.",
      "Fewer than 250 employees at the department received notices, the spokesperson said. An HHS official said that \"the same number of employees will be brought back in critical areas\" elsewhere at the department.",

      "\"The savings from these reductions will help redirect resources toward critical programs and strengthen our ability to serve the American people effectively. The goal is clear: reduce waste and maximize the impact of every taxpayer dollar,\" the HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "Among the cuts on Friday were around 50 employees at the NIH's National Cancer Institute, or NCI.

      "About 50 of the reports cited second- or third-degree burns to consumers' faces or bodies, the statement said.

      "Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC figures, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase.",
      "\"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death,\" Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.",
      "\"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels,\" Holliday said.",
      "There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional data reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.",
      "Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen high demand.",
      "Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes in 2023, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.",
      "Experts caution that analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.",
      "Also, not all death certificates record diabetes as the main \"underlying cause of death\" but instead as a contributing factor, which is counted separately.",
      "\"Diabetes is a more common contributing cause of death, not the primary underlying cause of death. Furthermore, most deaths among people with diabetes are cardiovascular and would be counted among the cardiovascular,\" Elizabeth Selvin, director of the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Selvin said it is up to doctors to choose whether to select diabetes or other underlying health conditions as the cause of a heart attack death.",

      "President Trump has been pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, writing on social media last month that the central bank has been \"TOO LATE AND WRONG\" in holding off on further reductions. Now, the Fed is set to meet on Wednesday to make its next rate decision \u2014 but Mr. Trump may need to wait longer to get his cuts.",
      "The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its May 7 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch. The group pegs the likelihood at 99% that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the same level that it's been at since December, when the central bank made its most recent reduction.",
      "The Fed's meeting comes at a time when the U.S. economy is sending mixed signals, with GDP unexpectedly falling into negative territory in the first quarter, while job growth topped forecasts in April. At the same time, Wall Street economists are hiking their recession risk\u00a0for the U.S. economy due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have hit imports from China with a 145% import duty \u2014 costs that are largely passed onto American consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "The Fed has signaled it will take a wait-and-see approach, with Powell saying at a speech last month that the central bank can stay patient while tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out.",
      "\"The Fed and investors find themselves in a no man's land waiting to see whether economic policies drive prices higher and growth lower,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, in an email.",
      "He added, \"The reality is that corporate earnings have been pretty strong, the U.S. economy barreling along and the biggest cause for concern is sentiment. There isn't a good reason to change rates at this point, and the Fed is likely to reiterate the need for more data with three rate cuts priced in for 2025, at this point starting in the summer.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting.",
      "What date is the Fed's next meeting?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-member group that sets rate decisions, will meet on May 6-7, with the Fed announcing the FOMC's decision on May 7.",
      "What time is the Fed rate announcement?",
      "The Fed will announce the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on May 7, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to discuss the committee's decision at a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EST that day.",
      "What are the odds of a Fed rate cut?",
      "Very slim, with economists projecting t99% odds that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"Criticism from President Trump will not trigger a Fed policy response \u2014 neither an early cut without evidence of labor market deterioration, nor a stubborn refusal to cut once the labor market does soften, provided long-term inflation expectations remain anchored,\" noted Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius in a May 6 research note.",
      "When is the Fed expected to cut rates?",
      "Consumers eager for relief on borrowing costs are likely going to face a wait, according to economists.",
      "Following the May 7 meeting, the Fed will next meet on June 18, with economists currently expecting the central bank to also hold steady then, according to CME FedWatch. Its polling finds a 70% likelihood that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.5% at that meeting.",
      "However, it's more likely the Fed could slash rates at its July 30 meeting, with the probability of a rate cut sitting currently at 80%, FedWatch notes.",
      "But some economists expect the central bank to hold off even longer.",
      "\"We think the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates next year, as tariff-induced inflation begins to fade and the labor market shows more troubling signs,\" noted Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan Sweet, who says he believes the first cut will occur in December.",
      "Why does Trump want a rate cut now?",
      "Mr. Trump argues that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that there is \"NO INFLATION\" and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon.",
      "But those claims are not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined \u2014 gas costs are down 10% from a year ago \u2014 continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "Borrowers who are looking for relief on loan and credit card rates will have a wait ahead of them, experts say.",
      "\"There's just so much uncertainty in the economy now,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in an email. \"No one quite knows what the next few months will look like, but what does seem clear is that Americans are going to have wait at least a little longer for the Fed to cut rates.\"",
      "Schulz predicts that credit card rates could tick higher in the next few months, as well as auto loan rates.",
      "\"Banks are nervous about all of the uncertainty in the economy and what it means for consumers,\" he noted. \"When that happens, banks try to minimize risk as much as possible, and one of the ways they do that is to raise interest rates on credit cards.\"",
      "Because of that, consumers should focus on shopping around for the best rates they can find, as well as considering transferring existing high-interest credit card debt to 0% balance transfer cards, Schulz added.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in almost one-third of its tax auditors leaving the agency through March, according to a report from the U.S. Treasury Department's watchdog.",
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has sought to trim the federal workforce through a combination of layoffs and so-called deferred resignation. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla,\u00a0said\u00a0on the electric vehicle maker's April 22 earnings call that DOGE's efforts \"in addressing waste and fraud\" will \"get the country back on track.\"",
      "The IRS has been a focus of DOGE's cost-cutting efforts, with plans to trim as much as 40% of its workforce this year. Through March, those efforts have resulted in the tax agency losing about 11% of its workforce, the May 2 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found.",
      "But revenue agents \u2014 the IRS workers who perform audits \u2014 have seen a much bigger hit, with 31% of those workers, or about 3,600 auditors, taking either the deferred resignation plan or getting fired in the first three months of 2025, the report found. Losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, given that these agents typically handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers or corporations, experts say.",
      "\"You lose the very staff trained to keep high-end taxpayers and corporate tax payers in compliance,\" noted Emily DiVito, senior adviser on economic policy at the left-leaning Groundwork Collaborative and a former policy adviser at the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS.",
      "She added, \"You can see some behavioral effects when taxpayers, especially those that really don't want to pay their bills, come to accept there is very little risk to not paying at all, or even filing.\"",
      "Reached for comment, a Treasury spokeswoman said, \"The Biden Administration grew the IRS from 79,431 to 102,309 personnel. Under new leadership, approximately the same number of employees have left the IRS, with a vast majority leaving voluntarily through the Deferred Resignation Program. The roll back of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions are vital to improve both efficiency and quality of service. The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy, and customer service the American people deserve.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately return a request for comment about the TIGTA report.",
      "While the TIGTA report didn't explain why auditor departures outpaced that of overall cuts at the IRS, the tax agency had made an effort under the Biden administration to hire more auditors in order to beef up revenue collection. In February 2024, the IRS had said it expected to collect hundreds of billions in additional taxes after using funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire more auditors.",
      "Because the DOGE cuts have focused on firing so-called \"probationary workers,\" or junior federal employees who typically have less than a year or two on the job, there may have been more newly hired auditors who were impacted by the reductions, DeVito said.",
      "Reducing federal revenue?",
      "Auditing wealthy Americans and corporations can be lucrative for the federal government. In fiscal year 2023, auditors recommended an additional $32 billion in tax assessments, the TIGTA report said.",
      "And every $1 spent on auditing the top 0.1% of earners can return about $26 in tax revenue, according to an analysis from Better IRS, an advocacy group for free tax filing.",
      "The cuts to the IRS' auditing force raises questions about the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, given that the tax agency is responsible for collecting the bulk of the nation's revenue, DeVito added.",
      "The combination of individual and corporate income taxes provides about 60 cents for every $1 in federal revenue, with the remaining 40 cents coming from payroll taxes and fees, such as paying admission to national parks, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "DOGE's cost-cutting efforts may end up costing almost as much as they've saved, according to an analysis last month from the nonpartisan research group the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "DOGE claims to have saved $165 billion, but the Partnership for Public Service estimates that the savings have come at a cost of $135 billion due to paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity. That figure also excludes the impact of multiple lawsuits filed against DOGE's actions, as well as lost tax revenue due to IRS cuts, the group said.",
      "The IRS could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an\u00a0estimate\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"The argument from DOGE is to save money \u2014 that if we don't have as big of a federal workforce, then we are saving the government money,\" DeVito said. But given the potential to lose out on tax revenue, the IRS reduction \"simply doesn't make sense,\" she said.",

      "In a Truth Social post, the president said he's authorizing the Department of Commerce and \u00a0the United States Trade Representative to begin the process of imposing a 100% tariffs \"on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.\"",

This is  a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat,\" the president wrote. \"It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!\"",

    "summary": "The Social Security Administration said it will now seek to recoup less money from beneficiaries. Advocates say the revised policy is still burdensome.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration is retreating from a recent policy change on the agency recovering overpayments that sparked concerns it could cause financial hardship for tens of thousands of beneficiaries.",
      "In an April 25 \"emergency message\" to Social Security employees, the agency said it is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%. The change comes after SSA on March 27 started recovering erroneous overpayments to Social Security recipients by\u00a0taking 100%\u00a0of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up sharply from the prior rate of 10%.",
      "The agency didn't explain its reason for the change, nor immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The 100% clawback policy was directed by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to\u00a0cut costs\u00a0at the agency. Dudek said in a March 7 press release that the change was needed to \"properly safeguard taxpayer funds.\"",
      "The agency's move to recover overpayments has long been a pain point for thousands of beneficiaries who are overpaid each year, with many people unaware they had received a bigger benefit than they were entitled to until receiving notices from the Social Security Administration.",
      "The agency's inspector general found that 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations, rather than the fault of the beneficiary.",
      "\"SSA's automated systems could not compute benefit payments due in certain situations, and the Agency did not provide employees with a comprehensive tool to use when they had to manually calculate them. Without adequate automation tools, employees can make errors,\" the inspector general said in a report.",
      "Severe clawbacks cause hardship",
      "Last year, the Biden administration\u00a0capped the clawback rate\u00a0at 10% after reports that some seniors and disabled beneficiaries had been forced into financial hardship, including homelessness, due to the prior 100% clawback rate. But that 10% rate was only effective for about a year, with the the agency returning it to a 100% rate in March.",
      "Those most at risk from the government's stepped-up effort to recover overpayments are the roughly one-third of Social Security recipients who rely on their monthly benefit check for at least 75% of their income. Some seniors have told CBS News they were left\u00a0too financially strapped\u00a0to afford rent, food and other basics.",
      "Many of the overpayments involve disabled workers who receive payments through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, whose recipients receive an average of $1,538 per month, said Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.",
      "One SSA\u00a0report found that SSDI has a higher rate of overpayments than the overall Social Security program because disabled recipients sometimes fail to report work income, which can occur if they're not aware they need to disclose extra earnings to the agency. Social Security\u00a0reduces benefits for disabled recipients who earn more than $1,620 a month.",
      "\"While walking back the clawback of overpayments from 100% to 50% is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities who receive SSDI,\" Adcock told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"A fifth of all SSDI beneficiaries rely on their benefits for almost all of their income. That means some SSDI recipients are still going to have trouble paying for rent, food, utilities and prescriptions\" with the 50% clawback rate.",
      "The Social Security Administration docked the the benefits of about 670,000 recipients by 10% for overpayment last year, according to KFF.",
      "Under the new rule, the 50% clawback for overpayments started April 25, according to the SSA's statement.",

      "If you still need to update your ID you're not alone: CBS data shows that dozens of states are behind on compliance.",
      "An analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that 30 states are less than 70% compliant. Out of all states, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation at 17%.",
      "Here's what you need to know to make sure you're ready for the May 7 Real ID deadline.",
      "What is a Real ID?",
      "The Real ID is a federally compliant license, learner permit or nondriver ID card issued by state driver's license agencies. You can tell if a state-issued license or ID card is a Real ID if it has a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "The symbol might look slightly different depending on the state from where it's issued: California, for example, puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Who needs a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are required for those over 18 who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification, unless they want to bring a valid U.S. passport.",
      "When will I need to use a Real ID?",
      "Americans will need to show Real IDs to access certain federal facilities \u2014 including TSA checkpoints \u2014 enter nuclear power plants and board commercial aircraft, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).",
      "Am I required to get a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are only required for those over 18 without a valid U.S. passport who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification.",
      "That's said, Real IDs are considered a more secure form of identification than a classic driver's license.",
      "The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the Federal Government \"set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, although some states started issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009.",
      "You can find more details on Real ID on the DHS' website.",
      "Can I use an Enhanced ID instead of a Real ID?",
      "Five states \u2014 Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Vermont \u2014 issue what is called an\u00a0Enhanced Driver's License\u00a0(EDL), or Enhanced ID. This is considered an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card.",
      "Whereas Real IDs have a star emblem, Enhanced IDs have an image of the U.S. flag in the top right corner or the word \"Enhanced\" at the top of the card.",
      "Both Real IDs and Enhanced IDs are federal documents that allow holders to fly domestically.",
      "Enhanced IDs also allow you to travel from the U.S. to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, without a passport \u2014 something you can't do with a regular Real ID.",
      "How much does a Real ID cost?",
      "Prices vary by state. In\u00a0New York, for example, there is no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the normal transactional cost you pay for a standard license, ID or renewal. Pennsylvania, however, charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees. New York charges an additional $30 fee for Enhanced IDs.",
      "It's best to check your state's Real ID guidelines for an accurate estimate of how much you'll pay. The same goes for Enhanced IDs.",
      "How do I get a Real ID? Can I apply for one online?",
      "Each state has a driver's licensing agency that issues Real IDs. To find out how to apply where you live, visit the DHS website and click on your state of residence for specific instructions. DHS recommends that you visit your state's driver's licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation you'll need to brings in order to obtain a Real ID.",
      "Be sure to plan ahead as some states have longer wait times for DMV appointments.",
      "What if I plan to travel next week but I don't have a Real ID yet?",
      "A TSA spokesperson told CBS News Philadelphia that if travelers show up to the airport next Wednesday without a Real ID they may still be able to fly, but getting on board the plane may take longer than usual. The transportation agency recommends that people without a Real ID arrive at the airport three hours early to ensure enough time to get through security.",
      "TSA said it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints, meaning approximately four out of every five travelers are showing up with a Real ID-compliant driver's license or another valid form of identification.",
      "\"We don't have concerns at this point about this deadline really impacting operations, especially for those people who again are prepared and have everything they're supposed to have,\" Jessica Mayle, a public affairs specialist at TSA, told CBS Philadelphia.",
      "Are there alternative forms of identification I can use at the airport?",
      "If you don't have a Real ID, TSA has a list of other valid forms of identification you can use to get through an airport checkpoint. This includes passports, permanent resident cards, Enhanced IDs and Global Entry cards.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of student loan borrowers could face a wake-up call Monday as the Department of Education resumes collecting on school loans. The restart of collections comes as data from a recent analysis shows delinquency rates among people with student debt are at an all-time high.",
      "After nearly five-years since the U.S. government first paused federal student loan payments and interest accrual as a temporary relief measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, May 5 marks the first day the Education Department's\u00a0Office\u00a0of Federal Student Aid (FSA) restarts collections on defaulted federal student loans.",
      "Referrals for collection had been put on hold since March 2020 because of the pandemic.",
      "\"The level of concern here really depends on the reasons a borrower has not paid their federal student loans. If they don't have the capacity, they may be overstretched,\" Michele Raneri, vice president and head of research at TransUnion, said in a statement. \"They may not know they have to pay them, may not be able to find the information on how to do so, or may not have a willingness to pay for one reason or another,\" she said.",
      "Still, one in five borrowers is \"seriously delinquent\" or has a past-due payment of 90 days or more, according to a new analysis by TransUnion, one of the three major credit bureaus. The analysis looks at the percentage of student loan borrowers at risk of default and the impact that has on their credit scores.",
      "Those in default face an uphill battle: Failing to make a payment means\u00a0the government can withhold portions of Social Security benefits and tax refunds and garnish wages. Defaulting on a loan can also tank your credit score, which in turn can make it more difficult to obtain a loan in the future.",
      "Read on for more information about the state of student loan borrowing as default collections resume.",
      "Millions at risk of defaulting",
      "The credit bureau's findings underscore how student loan repayments have struggled to get back on track since COVID-19. Payments on student loans were\u00a0paused\u00a0in March 2020 and didn't\u00a0resume\u00a0until October 2023.",
      "For borrowers across the U.S. who didn't have to worry about making payments for years, the resumption of student loan payments\u00a0presented a challenge\u00a0for many individuals struggling financially.",
      "Out of the 19.6 million student loan borrowers, TransUnion found that roughly 20% are at risk of defaulting. The figure \u2014 which TransUnion estimates could be much higher \u2014 outpaces the credit bureau's previously recorded all-time high of 15.4% in 2012.",
      "For its analysis, TransUnion looked at those susceptible to being 90-days past due on their loans. That winnowed the field of borrowers from roughly 42 million to a total of 19.6 million borrowers. Excluded from this report were people in deferment or forbearance, as well as private student loan borrowers.",
      "As the federal student aid\u00a0website\u00a0outlines, loan servicers can report borrowers who are behind on their loans for 90 days or more to the national credit bureaus.",
      "On average, people who faced default lost an average of 63 points, TransUnion found, although those with higher credit scores were at risk if losing much more. Those in \"super prime\" credit territory \u2014 defined by a spokesperson for TransUnion as a credit score of 781 or higher \u2014 saw an average credit score decline of 175 points as a result of impending student loan defaults.",
      "\"Borrowers can review their credit report to see what loan servicers are reporting,\" Raneri told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This can also help people find who to contact if they have a loan they didn't expect to see.\"",
      "To minimize student loan defaults, prioritizing income-driven repayment (IDR) plans \u2014 which tabulate the monthly payment based on what someone makes and their family size \u2014 along with better outreach to borrowers and automation could go a long way, Pew Charitable Trusts says in an online\u00a0post.",
      "\"Data-sharing could also be used to automatically enroll borrowers into an IDR plan if they fall severely behind on payments, a move that could significantly curb future defaults by connecting borrowers with affordable payments,\"\u00a0wrote\u00a0Regan Fitzgerald, senior manager; Brian Denten, officer; and Ilan Levine, senior associate at Pew's Student Loan Initiative.",
      "All told, the nation's nearly 43 million student loan borrowers hold a collective $1.6 trillion in debt, according to the Education Department. Agency\u00a0data indicates that over 5 million of these borrowers have not made a monthly payment in over 360 days, while only 38% are on track with their repayment plans.",
      "Secretary of Education: Long overdue",
      "Student loan collections were upended during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, during President Trump's first term in office, the Education Department paused student loan payments and knocked interest rates to zero to give borrowers some breathing room.",
      "When former President Biden took office in 2021, he extended the loan repayment deadline multiple times until Congress passed a law directing payments to resume in October 2023. The Biden administration made several attempts to deliver a student loan debt relief during his time in office, but his efforts were stymied by courts.",
      "While student loan repayments resumed over a year and a half ago, Monday, May 5, is the first day since March 2020 the Department of Education is collecting repayments from borrowers who have struggled to meet their payment deadlines. For U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, the return is long overdue.",
      "\"American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,\" said McMahon in an April statement. \"The Biden Administration misled borrowers: The executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear.

    "title": "A tariff loophole expires Friday. Here's what that means for shoppers.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/de-minimis-exemption-end-date-tariff/",
    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 12:43:59 -0400",
    "summary": "Cheaper goods from China are no longer exempt from import duties, which could sharply raise prices for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Cheaper goods from China are set to become a lot more expensive for U.S. consumers with the May 2 expiration of a loophole that formerly allowed lower cost packages to enter the country duty-free.",
      "Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu are among the major players that until Friday relied on the loophole that allowed them to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free, allowing them to undercut U.S.-based sellers. American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S.",
      "Temu, for one, announced a dramatic shift to its business model. \"All sales in the U.S. are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be as low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes.",
      "Why did Trump eliminate the de minimis exemption?",
      "President Trump in February said he would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the de minimis exemption \"a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\"",
      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",
      "What does the end of the exemption mean for consumers?",
      "Retailers are already tacking on hefty tariff surcharges to customers' orders, leading to sticker shock for some U.S. shoppers who had long relied on China for cheap imported goods.",
      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",
      "Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs.",
      "\"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarweb, a web analytics company.",
      "Larger corporations with bigger profit margins, or more diversified businesses, will likely fare better than smaller retailers that operate on thin profit margins, making it difficult to re-jigger supply chains.",
      "The consumer won't emerge unscathed.",
      "\"The rollback of the de minimis exemption for tariffed goods is poised to hit consumers' wallets,\" PwC consumer markets industry leader Ali Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She expects to see consumers start \"trading down\" by swapping name brands for store labels, or even turning to resale platforms to stretch budgets.",

    "story": [
      "As Small Business Month kicks off, the Chamber of Commerce is speaking out against the Trump administration's trade policy, saying recently imposed tariffs could do serious damage to America's Main Street.",
      "In a letter\u00a0sent to the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday, Suzanne Clark, president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce, asks for an \"automatic exclusion\" from new tariffs for U.S. small businesses that import goods from abroad. Small businesses do not have the margin or capital reserves to survive an increase in tariffs, Clark wrote in the letter.",
      "\"The Chamber requests the administration take immediate action to save America's small businesses and stave off a recession,\" she wrote.",
      "The Trump administration's tariff policies are already weighing on growth and have\u00a0raised the chances\u00a0of a recession over the next 12 months, according to economists. Still, the International Monetary Fund\u00a0said\u00a0in April it does not expect the U.S. to enter a recession in 2025.",
      "Clark added that tariffs could cause \"irreparable harm\" to the small business community if trade deals are not reached soon. Products from most countries are subject a 10% tariff, while products from China face a much steeper levy of up to 145%.",
      "In an interview with Time\u00a0magazine last week, President Trump said that trade deals would be reached in the \"next three to four weeks.\" In the meantime, small businesses are being forced to make difficult decisions about how to operate amid uncertainty as a result of on-and-off tariffs. One business owner who recently spoke to\u00a0CBS MoneyWatch\u00a0said she fears her company may have to close up shop for good.",
      "Less room to maneuver",
      "If tariffs persist, small business owners could end up passing on the cost to customers in the form of higher prices, as large corporations such as Amazon, Temu and Shein have done in recent weeks.",
      "However, unlike huge corporations, any declines in consumer spending as a result of higher prices could spell financial disaster for many small businesses, which typically operate with tight margins. Roughly 43% of small business owners said their companies would not survive if they fell short on revenue for three to four quarters, according to a recent TD Bank survey.",

    "summary": "In recent weeks, Social Security has been plagued by problems related to technology, system errors, and even the marking of living people as dead.",
    "story": [
      "Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people.",
      "They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom \"there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.\" So employees have to \"resurrect\" them \u2014 affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits.",
      "Revivals were \"sporadic\" before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. \"In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,\" he said.",
      "It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead \"impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.\"",
      "\"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.",
      "Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\"",
      "Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said.",
      "The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.",
      "But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.",
      "Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer \u2014 whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record \u2014 believes they could be zero.",
      "Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.",
      "Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.",
      "The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\"",
      "Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.",
      "While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.",
      "For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to a January survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance.",
      "Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.",
      "Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\"",
      "When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient.",
      "\"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.",
      "Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.",
      "A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security \u2014 which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 \u2014 had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.",
      "Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.",
      "\"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\"",
      "What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.",
      "She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.",
      "Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored \u2014 the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.",
      "\"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency.",
      "Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\"",
      "The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which \"the problems surface first,\" Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, \"those things languish.\"",
      "Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program.",
      "Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks \"just sit there.\"",
      "Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and \"those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,\" putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said.",
      "Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. \"There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,\" said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said.",
      "The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. \"It's more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it's underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,\" he said.",

      "Buffett, who has been leading Berkshire Hathaway for 60 years, said he will step down at the end of the year. He had previously said he didn't want to retire because he enjoys figuring out where to invest Berkshire's money too much, and that he planned to continue working until he dies or becomes incapacitated.",
      "Buffett said he will recommend to Berkshire Hathaway's board that Greg Abel should become CEO at the end of the year.",
      "\"I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the Chief Executive office of the company at year end,\" Buffett said. \"I want to spring that on the directors effectively, and then get that as my recommendation ... I think they'll be unanimously in favor of it.\"",
      "The 94-year-old remains in good health, though he does use a cane. Buffett announced the news at the end of a five-hour question-and-answer period and didn't take any questions about it.",
      "He said the only board members who knew this was coming were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, had no warning.",
      "About an hour later, Abel came out to oversee the formal Berkshire business meeting without Buffett, and he addressed the announcement.",
      "\"I just want to say I couldn't be more humbled and honored to be part of Berkshire as we go forward,\" Abel said.",
      "Abel has been Buffett's designated successor for years, and he already manages all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses. But it was always assumed he wouldn't take over until after Buffett's death.",
      "Buffett also said he will not be selling any shares of Berkshire Hathaway.",
      "\"I will not, I have no intention, zero of selling one share, of Berkshire Hathaway, it will get given away, gradually,\" he said. \"The decision to keep every share is an economic decision, because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under management than mine.\"",
      "Buffett gave warning on Trump's tariffs",
      "The announcement came as he warned that the United States shouldn't use \"trade as a weapon\" and anger the rest of the world like President Trump has done with his\u00a0tariffs that roiled global markets.",
      "\"It's a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don't like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,\" Buffett, 94, said as he addressed the topic on everyone's mind at the start of the shareholders meeting.",
      "While Buffett said it is best for trade to be balanced between countries, he doesn't think Mr. Trump is going about it the right way with his widespread tariffs. He said the world will be safer if more countries are prosperous.",
      "\"We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,\" he said.",
      "America has been going through revolutionary changes ever since its birth and the promise of equality for all, which wasn't fulfilled until years later, Buffett said. But nothing that is going on today has changed his long-term optimism about the country.",
      "\"If I were being born today, I would just keep negotiating in the womb until they said, 'You could be in the United States,'\" Buffett said.",
      "Tariffs were the top subject that shareholders asked about in the questions they sent ahead of time to the CNBC reporter who will grill Buffett and his top two managers throughout the day. But investors will also be looking for him to explain why he is sitting on $347.7 billion in cash at Berkshire.",
      "Buffett said he just doesn't see many attractively priced investments that he understands these days, but he predicted that one day Berkshire will be \"bombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for.\"",
      "The meeting attracts some 40,000 people, including celebrities and well-known investors. Hillary Rodham Clinton was in attendance this year. Clinton was the last candidate Buffett backed publicly, before backing away from politics and other controversial topics for fear of hurting Berkshire's businesses.",
      "Attendee Haibo Liu traveled from China and camped out overnight outside the arena to be first in line Saturday morning.",
      "\"He has helped me a lot,\" said Liu. \"I really want to express my thanks to him.\"",

      "Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and the architect of ChatGPT, is behind a venture that wants to solve a modern-day problem: proving you're human amidst a proliferation of bots and artificial intelligence.",
      "The startup, called World (formerly Worldcoin), is launching in the U.S. with the distribution of 20,000 tech devices called Orbs that scan a person's retina to verify they are human. After confirming a person's humanity, World then creates a digital ID for users that proves their personhood, distinguishing them from a bot or AI program that can mimic human behavior.",
      "The device, which looks like something out of \"Black Mirror,\" may seem ironic coming from Altman, given that its purpose is to help people stand out from the very same types of technology he helped develop. But World's backers say the Orb and its \"proof of personhood\" is addressing a problem that can stymie everything from finance to online dating: bots impersonating people.",
      "The Orb \"is a privacy-first way to prove you are a human in the world of AI and bots,\" said Jake Brukhman, co-founder of CoinFund, one of the project's earliest backers. \"That is getting relevant as AI is becoming much more prevalent in the world.\"",

      "World isn't exactly new, as it debuted outside the U.S. in 2023 and has already sparked privacy backlash, with Kenya's government shutting down the service, according to the Associated Press. Other jurisdictions followed suit, including Hong Kong and Spain.",
      "\"I will say that upon the launch in 2023 there was a lot of noise about this,\" Brukhman said. \"But a lot of noise came from the lack of understanding about the Orb and how it works.\"",
      "The Orb doesn't store any biometric data, he added. The device takes photos to ensure a person is human, but then stores that info on the user's device, not in the Orb, according to World's website.",
      "World also has a link to cryptocurrencies, as the Orb's human-verification process is designed to be used in the World App, which is a digital wallet that gives people access to decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies.",
      "The time is right for a rollout in the U.S., Brukhman said, with expectations of looser crypto regulations under Trump administration. President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, is working on a \"crypto strategic reserve\" for the nation.",
      "The Orbs will be rolled out in stores in six U.S. cities, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami and San Francisco, as well as at gaming retailer Razer, with the idea that people can go to physical locations to get themselves verified as human.",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 177,000 jobs in April, new federal data shows, a sign the labor market is still humming despite ongoing economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's trade policies.",
      "The numbers",
      "Job growth was stronger than expected in April, the Labor Department said Friday in its monthly employment report. Payroll gains exceeded economist forecasts of 135,000 last month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%, matching forecasts from analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "The data suggests the labor market remains healthy despite rising concerns about how the Trump administration's tariff policies will impact economic activity.",
      "Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, said in a research note that the stronger-than-expected pace of job-creation last month shows the risks of a recession are low, at least for now.",
      "\"There is nothing to complain about here. You cannot find any evidence of a nascent recession in these figures,\" he said, while noting that tariffs are likely to take a toll on hiring in the months to come.\"We are waiting for layoffs to begin and for claims and unemployment to rise,\" he added. \"This month's payrolls figure was a lot better than expected, but the strong trend in employment does not last in our forecast.\"",
      "Health care companies, along with the transportation and warehousing sector, saw the largest gains in employment last month, adding 51,000 and 29,000 jobs, respectively.",
      "The jump in transportation and warehousing jobs \u2014 more than double its 12-month average of 12,000 \u2014 was notable. Cory Stahle, an economist from Indeed Hiring Lab economist, thinks that could indicate companies are adding to their inventories ahead of tariffs taking effect and boosting their costs.",
      "Federal employment declined by 9,000, up from 4,000 in March. Government layoffs have risen in recent months because of cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which the Trump administration touts as a cost-saving effort.",
      "\"April may have been the last month when we didn't see the aggregate impact of trade war 2.0, DOGE job cuts and tight immigration policy. But look closely enough and there are hints, like the slight decline in manufacturing payrolls and another drop in federal government jobs,\" Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Although the latest employment numbers suggest a steady job market, government data this week showed that more Americans are filing for unemployment benefits as layoffs mount. Jobless claims increased 18,000 to 241,000 for the week ending April 26, the highest level since mid-February, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "\"Continued claims are more volatile week to week, but remain elevated, signaling that workers who lose their job are facing challenges in finding new employment,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "In another important snapshot of the economy this week, the nation's gross domestic product shrank 0.3% in the first three months of the year, down from growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. The main reason for the sharp decline was the rush by consumers and businesses to order imported goods ahead of tariffs taking effect (Imports reduce GDP, while exports increase it.)",
      "What experts are saying",
      "Experts say the economy has proved resilient, with steady hiring despite concern over the Trump administration's trade policies. A recession appears unlikely for now, although economists note it could take several months for tariff-induced instability to appear in the government's monthly job numbers.",
      "\"Some of the increase in employment in April... reflects a burst of pre-tariff activity, which will unravel over the next couple months,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "Soft data like consumer confidence survey,\u00a0polling\u00a0and jobless claims show signs of economic weakness.",
      "The solid job gains in April also increase the odds that the Federal Reserve will keep its benchmark interest rate steady when policy makers meet next week on May 6-7, experts say.",
      "\"The healthy 177,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in April and unchanged unemployment rate will reassure the Fed that there is no need to be hasty in lowering interest rates when it meets next week,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report.",

    "summary": "A Chinese exporter says Trump's tariffs simply aren't fair, while a U.S. buyer hopes for a trade war truce, because \"China produces what you want.\"",
    "story": [
      "Guangzhou, China\u00a0\u2014 The annual Canton Fair in Guangzhou is China's largest import-export trade show. It covers a space equal to about 200 football fields and has been running since 1957 \u2014 when China's economy was isolated from the rest of the world. The country's leaders decided the expo, since formally named the China Import and Export Fair, was the best way to overcome trade obstacles imposed by the West and to drum up business investment and interest from overseas markets.",
      "In the almost seven decades since, China has transformed into the world's manufacturing powerhouse. But President Xi Jinping's government believes the U.S. is once again working to isolate China, through President Trump's tariff trade war, and that Washington will try to force other countries \u2014 and their consumers \u2014 to pick a side.",
      "Richard Qiu told CBS News it's simply unfair. Wearing a pale blue Ralph Lauren shirt, the businessman invited CBS News to sit down in his display booth at the Canton Fair for a chat. Surrounded by thousands of small fabric gift bags designed for everything from Christmas to Easter to birthdays, the fact that Qiu even quickly agreed to an interview was disarming; Every other Chinese businessperson we approached turned our camera away, wary of speaking with foreign media.",
      "His openness and warmth indicated a sense of ease with Westerners, and more importantly, his desire to tell his story about how external forces, completely out of his control, were affecting him and his livelihood.",
      "Qiu's Liaoning Perfect Import/Export Co. Ltd has been making gift bags for 20 years, and he has fostered strong relationships with his U.S. customers, who, in recent years, have made up 30-40% of his exports. He's traveled to the U.S. at least six times and says he loves the country: \"It's about freedom, democracy, it's open and fair.\"",
      "\"But this isn't fair,\" he said of the trade war sparked by President Trump's steep tariffs. \"It makes me feel sick about the U.S. now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump insists his tariffs will, despite current economic pain in the U.S., bring manufacturing back to America and buoy the economy, reshaping the global trade system. But Qiu said it's about something else. He believes President Trump is punishing China for being the best at producing everyday products at affordable prices, and using that prowess to dominate the global market.",
      "\"Our people are industrious, diligent, working hard to make the products good price, good quality, to sell all over the world. It's not our problem,\" he said. \"I think it's your problem.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump imposed 145% tariffs on all Chinese imports \u2014 though the White House later exempted smartphones and some other electronics from the levies \u2014 Qiu says his U.S. sales have ground to a halt.",
      "\"U.S. buyers said, 'Richard you have to stop production; we have to cancel it.' I think 90% of my U.S. orders will be canceled.\"",
      "For years, the Canton Fair has been packed with American buyers looking to bring their customers back at home the best possible deals on offer. But this year, officials admitted to CBS News that the numbers are way down \u2014 another sign of President Trump's trade war taking hold.",
      "One American we did come across perusing the stalls in Guangzhou wasn't there to buy, but rather to research new products.",
      "\"Tariffs are going to come down at some point and we need to be ready for it,\" Jonathan Scheerz who lives in Michigan, where he runs a homewares business, told CBS News. He said he got a lot of orders in for products from China before Mr. Trump's inauguration, because he was anticipating a trade war \u2014 but not like this.",
      "\"I don't want to bring them in at the current tariff rate,\" he lamented. \"It just doesn't work. It's too high, but I also don't believe it's going to last months and months.\"",
      "The optimism is based on his belief that no one does it better than China when it comes to offering so many different products at such low prices.",
      "\"In my eyes, China produces what you want,\" Scheerz said. \"Simple as that.\"",
      "But if the trade war does drag on, many business owners who spoke with CBS News off camera said they were prepared to take the pain.",
      "Qiu knows tough days are ahead. He's looking to diversify his export portfolio in Europe, but there's only so much the market can absorb, so it's uncertain times.",
      "\"It's like a war, I think. Under a war, the most suffering is the people, no matter if it's the U.S. or China,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Qiu added, however, that over the course of China's history, the country has endured real hardship and pain, and he believes the Chinese people have the strength and fortitude to do it again.",
      "\"If we do something unfair, I will not support the government, but it's your government \u2014 the U.S. government that's put unfair things on us, so we say, 'okay, we fight.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House GOP leaders stressed early this week that the budget package central to President Trump's agenda remains on track even as they acknowledged a delay that comes amid simmering disagreements in the Republican conference that have threatened to stunt progress on reconciliation.",
      "\"It just made sense for us to push pause for a week to make sure that we do this right,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Tuesday at his weekly news conference.",
      "The committee work on budget reconciliation officially kicked off last week, as a number of panels considered their portions of the major package, which is aimed at addressing the president's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. But a handful of key committees have yet to schedule votes on their portions of the budget package, after Johnson said leaders made a decision to push the markups back a week, while disagreements persist over some of the most divisive elements of the forthcoming legislation \u2014 like an expansion to the state and local tax deduction and Medicaid cuts.",
      "Johnson on Tuesday expressed confidence that the lower chamber would complete its work by Memorial Day, a day after acknowledging to reporters that he put the package on a \"very ambitious time table\" and that the self-imposed deadline could slip past the holiday.",
      "\"We can pass that by Memorial Day. That was our original timeframe,\" he said.",
      "Committees face a May 9 deadline to complete their committee work under the budget resolution that the House and Senate adopted in April. But Johnson said the plan is to have committees complete their work and send the components of the bill to the House Budget Committee, which will incorporate the recommendations for the government's spending into a massive legislative package, by the end of next week.",
      "The House Energy and Commerce Committee had been targeting a Wednesday markup, but the panel has yet to schedule one. The House Ways and Means Committee and Agriculture Committee have yet to complete their work as well.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with identifying the biggest spending cuts \u2014 at least $880 billion over the next decade. The effort has become among the most closely watched in the reconciliation process, as Republicans look to dispel concerns about cuts to the popular entitlement program, stressing that they intend solely to root out waste, fraud and abuse, while some GOP hard-liners seek deeper spending cuts.",
      "Meanwhile, disagreements over the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, have come before the Ways and Means Committee, as conservatives oppose a push to increase the cap from Republicans in blue states. Still, Ways and Means Committee chairman Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, said Sunday on Fox News that House Republicans will \"get the job done,\" adding that \"failure is simply not an option.\"",
      "\"We're going to find the equilibrium point on SALT that no one will be totally delighted with, but it'll solve the equation, and we'll get it done,\" Johnson said Monday, referring to the deduction by its acronym.",
      "Johnson said Monday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump that day about budget reconciliation, and he noted that leadership is meeting with groups of members in the GOP conference on Tuesday as they try to push forward on the process.",
      "At his Tuesday news conference, Johnson was asked whether he has made assurances to the moderate and conservative factions of his conference that he can't keep.",
      "\"I don't make promises that I can't keep. This is a consensus building operation,\" he said. \"We've been working really hard to take all the input and find that kind of equilibrium point where everybody is at least satisfied. Some people are not going to be elated by every provision of the bill. It's impossible. The bill is one big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, told members in their morning meeting that they need to \"focus on the totality of the bill and not just individual details,\" according to Johnson.",
      "But Scalise also alluded to the plan slipping beyond Memorial Day, telling reporters Tuesday after the Republican conference meeting that \"we're on track to continue to deliver on this one big, beautiful bill and get it through the process and ideally to get it on the president's desk in June.\"",
      "Lawmakers also cast doubt on whether they could meet the Memorial Day deadline.",
      "\"That's wishful thinking, I guess,\" Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, said. \"But you know, when I raised the speed limit in Tennessee to 70, I asked for 85. And 70 is what I wanted, so.\"",

      "A 25% import tariff on goods from Canada not covered by the USMCA trade agreement went into effect March 4.

Canada retaliated against the U.S. with tariffs on many U.S. goods.",

      "The panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit heard arguments in emergency appeals from the Trump administration after two federal judges issued separate decisions in favor of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, and Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student at Columbia University, last month.",
      "Administration officials are asking the 2nd Circuit to pause the lower court orders issued in Ozturk and Mahdawi's cases while their challenges to their respective detentions move forward. In Ozturk's case, U.S. District Judge William Sessions issued an order for Ozturk, who is being detained at a facility in Louisiana, to be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in Vermont and set a bail hearing for her to attend in person on May 9.",

      "Ozturk co-authored an editorial in the Tufts' student newspaper that criticized the school for its dismissal of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate as a \"sincere effort to hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\" The editorial did not mention Hamas.",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, Esha Bhandari, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Ozturk, said her client has been \"held behind bars for six weeks while her health deteriorates for writing an op-ed.\" All she is asking for is for the temporary transfer order to be completed as court proceedings play out in Vermont, Bhandari said.",
      "\"The executive branch made a specific decision to detain Ms. Ozturk because of her speech,\" she said.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in part that the district court in Vermont does not have jurisdiction over Ozturk's habeas petition because it was not filed where she is confined \u2014 Louisiana \u2014 and did not name her immediate custodian as a defendant \u2014 the warden at the detention center.",
      "But Bhandari argued that the executive branch effectively suspended the writ of habeas corpus on its own by refusing to specify to Ozturk's lawyers who had custody of her, which would have allowed them to name that person as the defendant in Ozturk's challenge to her detention.",
      "Bhandari called the government's position \"breathtaking.\"",
      "According to court filings, a memorandum from a senior official with the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs said Ozturk's visa was revoked based on a request from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, which determined that she \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization.'\"",
      "After she was arrested, Ozturk was transported to Methuen, Massachusetts, and transported to Lebanon, New Hampshire, followed by St. Albans, Vermont, where she was kept overnight. On the morning of March 26, in Burlington, Vermont, Ozturk was put on a plane and flown to Louisiana, where she is currently in custody at an immigration facility in Basile.",
      "Ozturk's lawyers filed a petition challenging her arrest and detention as a violation of the First and Fifth Amendments in federal district court in Massachusetts. But the case was transferred to Sessions' court in Vermont after it was determined that Ozturk was detained in that state at the time the petition was filed.",
      "The Justice Department sought to dismiss Ozturk's petition while her lawyers asked Sessions to order her to be released or transferred to Vermont while her claims are adjudicated.",
      "Sessions last month ruled that Ozturk's arrest and detention raised \"significant constitutional concerns\" and said she must be transferred to ICE custody in Vermont by May 1. He also set a bail hearing for May 9, with Ozturk appearing in person, and will consider the merits of her habeas petition on May 22.",
      "The 2nd Circuit temporarily paused Sessions' order late last month while it considers the Trump administration's request for emergency relief.",
      "Mahdawi, who is to graduate from Columbia this month with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, was detained by immigration agents in Vermont last month during what he was told was his citizenship interview.",
      "He was born in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and he has held a green card for the last 10 years and co-founded his university's Palestinian Student Union, alongside Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, Columbia Ph.D. student and U.S. resident detained by the government. Mahdawi's attorneys said he took a \"step back\" from the high-profile protests at the school before students began occupying university buildings.",
      "Khalil, a Palestinian born in Syria, was a vocal member of last year's protests at Columbia. He was arrested by ICE in March. He is also challenging his removal and detention, though an immigration judge allowed the government to proceed with its effort to deport Khalil.",
      "In an interview with CBS News the day before his arrest, Mahdawi called the interview a \"honey trap\" that allowed federal immigration officials to detain him while he went in to pursue U.S. citizenship.",
      "Mahdawi's attorneys secured a court order that blocked the Trump administration from deporting him or moving him outside of Vermont. Then, last week, Crawford released Mahdawi from federal detention as his immigration proceedings continue and again barred the government from removing him from the state or country.",
      "A U.S. attorney arguing against Mahdawi's release said that keeping him in detention would be a \"constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process\" and argued in court filings that Mahdawi's \"presence and activities\" in the U.S. \"have serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" if he remains here.",
      "But Naz Ahmad, who argued on Mahdawi's behalf before the 2nd Circuit, told the judges that the government's detention of her client was \"retaliatory\" and had not only chilled his speech, but also others. He is challenging his detention as a violation of the First and First Amendments.",
      "If the 2nd Circuit grants the Justice Department's request for the stay in Mahdawi's case, it would allow immigration authorities to re-detain him. But two of the judges on the panel seemed to question how the government is harmed by the lower court's decision ordering Mahdawi's release.",
      "Barrington asked Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, whether an \"adverse\" decision constitutes irreparable harm to the government. Irreparable harm is one of four factors courts analyze when considering whether to grant a stay of a lower court order.",
      "Ensign mentioned operational costs to the government that would arise from Mahdawi having to participate in immigration proceedings, which are being held separately in Louisiana, from Vermont.",
      "One of the judges noted that in both Mahdawi and Ozturk's cases, the district court judges have indicated a \"strong desire\" to move quickly when considering the challenges to their allegedly unlawful detentions.",
      "The Trump administration has been cracking down on U.S. universities and their students who were involved in pro-Palestinian protests waged after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, which triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order in January that ordered his administration to use \"all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\" The White House said that these efforts would include deporting alleged \"Hamas sympathizers\" and revoking student visas.",

      "The National Institutes of Health has laid off hundreds more staff, multiple current and laid-off employees of the health agency told CBS News, including at its cancer research institute.",
      "Around 200 employees began receiving layoff notices Friday evening, said three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The move surprised NIH officials, since the department previously claimed no further cuts were planned at the agency.",
      "\"We thought the worst was behind us, and we were transitioning into this new phase, and the rug was just pulled out from underneath us,\" one laid-off employee said.",
      "A spokesperson for the NIH did not comment on why NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya sought the additional layoffs, referring an inquiry to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. An HHS spokesperson said that, after a review, the department had notified additional employees that they were \"also impacted\" by the layoffs plan announced in March.",
      "Fewer than 250 employees at the department received notices, the spokesperson said. An HHS official said that \"the same number of employees will be brought back in critical areas\" elsewhere at the department.",
      "Two people said they had been told that the second round of cuts was done as part of an effort to compensate for other scientists needing to be reinstated, in order to comply with layoff targets.",
      "\"The savings from these reductions will help redirect resources toward critical programs and strengthen our ability to serve the American people effectively. The goal is clear: reduce waste and maximize the impact of every taxpayer dollar,\" the HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "Among the cuts on Friday were around 50 employees at the NIH's National Cancer Institute, or NCI. They had worked in the institute's\u00a0Office of Communications and Public Liaison\u00a0overseeing programs like the\u00a0Cancer Information Service, which provides answers to doctors and patients about cancer, and updates to databases\u00a0summarizing\u00a0cancer information for healthcare providers.",
      "The layoff notices came a day after staff in that NCI communications office had met with top-ranking NIH leaders, to discuss drawing up plans to consolidate their staff into a new centralized communications arm across the agency.",
      "While several communications offices at the NIH's institutes had been gutted during an initial round of layoffs on April 1, NCI's team was spared. Around 150 staff at NCI had been laid off last month, two people said. The institute's contracting and training staff were eliminated, and there were deep cuts to its human resources team.",
      "\"Leadership was in the process of transferring some process and some of our media relations people over to NIH, because they were still getting press inquiries, but they couldn't handle the volume of inquiries that were coming through,\" the laid-off employee said.",

    "summary": "Alcatraz, a notorious former prison on an island in San Francisco Bay, once housed some famous gangsters like Al Capone and George \"Machine-Gun\" Kelly.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Sunday he is directing his administration to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the notorious former prison on an island off San Francisco, California.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social site, Mr. Trump wrote that, \"For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering. When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That's the way it's supposed to be.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he is directing the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Homeland Security to \"reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.\"",
      "\"The reopening of ALCATRAZ will serve as a symbol of Law, Order and JUSTICE,\" he added.",
      "A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons told The Associated Press in a statement that the agency \"will comply with all Presidential Orders.\" The spokesperson did not immediately answer the AP's questions regarding the practicality and feasibility of reopening Alcatraz or the agency's role in the future of the former prison given the National Park Service's control of the island.",
      "Mr. Trump's social media post comes as he has been clashing with the courts as he tries to send accused gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, without due process. Mr. Trump has also talked about wanting to send American citizens there and to other foreign prisons.",
      "Mr. Trump, returning to the White House on Sunday night, told reporters he came up with the idea because of frustrations with \"radicalized judges\" who have insisted those being deported receive due process.",
      "\"It's an idea I had I guess because the judges, so many of these radicalized judges they want to have trials for every single person. Think of it. Every single person that is in our country illegally,\" he said.",
      "He called Alcatraz \"a bad symbol, but it's a symbol of law and order.\"",
      "Why was Alcatraz closed?",
      "Alcatraz prison, located on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, just over a mile north of the city, was a maximum-security, minimum-privilege prison opened in 1934 to deal with the \"most incorrigible inmates in federal prisons,\" the Bureau of Prisons says. Before that, dating back to the 1850s, the site was used by the U.S. Army as a defensive citadel and to hold military prisoners.",
      "The prison was designed to \"show the law-abiding public that the Federal Government was serious about stopping the rampant crime of the 1920s and 1930s,\" the bureau says on its website.",
      "Well-known criminals such as Al Capone, George \"Machine-Gun\" Kelly, Alvin Karpis (the first \"Public Enemy No. 1\") and Arthur \"Doc\" Barker did time in Alcatraz, according to the BOP. However, most of the prisoners were not infamous gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules and regulations of other federal institutions.",
      "Alcatraz had a capacity of 336 prisoners, though the average population was only about 260 to 275 at any given time.",
      "Over the 29 years that it operated as a prison, 36 men were involved in 14 separate escape attempts. Of these, 23 were caught, six were shot and killed, and two drowned.",
      "It closed on March 21, 1963, because the prison was too expensive to continue to operate, the BOP said. Because of its location on an island, all of its supplies \u2014 food, fuel, even fresh water \u2014 had to be brought in by boat. It was also expensive to maintain, with salt water surrounding it causing deterioration of the buildings.",
      "The government determined at the time that it cost three times more per prisoner to operate Alcatraz than any other federal prison, and that would be more economical to shut it down and build a whole new facility, the bureau said.",
      "After it closed, it was basically abandoned for years. In 1969, a group of Native American Indian activists occupied Alcatraz for 18 months, claiming it as Indian land.",
      "Can people visit Alcatraz?",
      "After its closure, the prison was often portrayed as \"America's Devil's Island\" in books and movies, including \"The Rock\" starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage and the 1979 film \"Escape from Alcatraz\" starring Clint Eastwood.",
      "In 1972, Congress created the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the island where Alcatraz sits on was included as part of a new National Park Service site. The island opened to tourists in the fall of 1973 and has become one of the most popular National Park Service sites.",
      "Alcatraz Island continues to operate as a tourist site to this day, with more than a million tourists visiting the site each year \u2013 generating $60 million for the National Park Service and its partners. Taking it away as a tourist site would hurt the city, said former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.",
      "John Martini, who gave tours of the site for the National Park Service, said Alcatraz isn't equipped to be a working prison.",
      "\"There's no running water,\" he said. \"There's no sanitation. There's no heat.\"",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes the island, questioned the feasibility of reopening the prison after so many years.",

      "Mohsen Mahdawi's comments marked his first network interview since a judge ordered his release last week \u2014 a move Mahdawi called a \"light of hope\" to other student activists who have been detained, like Columbia's Mahmoud Khalil and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk.",
      "Shortly after Mahdawi's release, he addressed a group of supporters, saying of Mr. Trump and his Cabinet, \"I am not afraid of you.\" Mahdawi told CBS News he addressed Mr. Trump directly because \"there is this philosophy of intimidation, of punitive justice \u2026 so I wanted to share to them that you can do whatever you want. You will not silence me.\"",
      "\"I am a peacemaker. And when they arrested me, that is a red flag to everybody,\" Mahdawi said.",
      "Mahdawi was in custody for about two weeks. He told CBS News he arrived for his citizenship appointment in Vermont in mid-April, took a citizenship test and signed a document that said he is willing to pledge allegiance to the Constitution. Toward the end of that process, he said immigration agents entered the office and detained him. Mahdawi said he does not know why they waited, instead of taking him into custody as soon as he arrived.",
      "\"What I know is this is a betrayal to the Constitution of this country and to the process,\" Mahdawi said. \"I've done everything the right way. I've gone through the process. \u2026 I've applied the right way. I showed up for my interview. I shared and answered all of the questions honestly. And I said I am willing to defend and protect the Constitution of this country.\"",
      "Mahdawi, who helped lead Columbia's protests against the Israel-Hamas war starting in 2023, was detained under a rarely used law allowing the government to revoke visas for people the Secretary of State believes could pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "Mahdawi said he found the Trump administration's rationale for detaining him \"laughable.\"",
      "\"A person who has been vocally advocating for justice and peace is undermining U.S. policy?\" he said to CBS News on Monday.",
      "Mahdawi is one of several student activists to face detention. Fellow Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil and Tufts student Rumeysa Ozturk, who co-wrote a pro-Palestinian op-ed in the campus newspaper, were detained in March under the same legal grounds alleging the risk of \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Both students are separately suing for their release.",
      "A letter calling for Mahdawi's deportation and signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio reads, \"Mahdawi has been identified at those protests as having engaged in threatening rhetoric and intimidation of pro-Israeli bystanders.\" But in a video from November 2023 obtained by CBS News, Mahdawi is seen leading a crowd chanting \"shame on you\" to denounce a protester who made an antisemitic comment. He also told CBS News in an interview last month, \"We made it very clear that our movement is about justice, and antisemitism has no place in our movement.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended the practice of taking away visas. In a statement last month, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said green cards and visas are a \"privilege.\"",
      "\"When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,\" McLaughlin added.",
      "Mahdawi has denied allegations of antisemitism and has said he took a step back from the protests before demonstrators formed encampments on Columbia's campus and occupied a school building, drawing nationwide attention and criticism.",
      "He sued in federal court for his release hours after his detention, with his lawyers arguing the move violated his First Amendment rights. U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered his release from federal custody last Wednesday, writing that Mahdawi had \"made substantial claims that his detention is the result of retaliation for protected speech.\"",

      "Days after a CBS News report revealed the Justice Department halted grant funding to nearly 400 nonprofit and crime victims' groups, House Judiciary Committee Democrats have asked the department to hand over information on the agency's decision by a May 19 deadline.",
      "Among other things, Democrats on the GOP-led panel have asked the Justice Department to detail if any of the cuts were directed by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Governmental Efficiency, which has slashed government grants as part of an administration-wide cost-cutting drive. They also questioned whether more grant cuts are planned.",
      "In a letter sent Monday to Attorney General Pam Bondi, the lawmakers wrote, \"The Department's notifications to grantees not only fail to provide awardees with any explanation as to why their awards conflict with or do not serve the DOJ's priorities, but also do not provide any details as to how these termination decisions were made.\"",
      "The committee's inquiry to the Justice Department asked, \"How does the Department plan to immediately support crime victims in the wake of terminating grants that support initiatives to provide support and counseling to crime victims, such as guidance on finding safe housing and referrals to victims' compensation programs?\"",

      "President Trump, in his first term, promised to end America's HIV epidemic \u2014 and he put the resources of the federal government behind the effort. This time, he has deployed the powers of his office to gut funding, abandoning those communities at highest risk of HIV.",
      "Mr. Trump's earlier efforts targeted seven Southern states, including Mississippi, where funds went to community groups and health departments that tailor interventions to historically underserved communities that face discrimination and have less access to quality education, health care, stable income, and generational wealth. Such factors help explain why Black people accounted for 38% of HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2023, despite representing only 14% of the population, and also why half of the country's new HIV infections occur in the South.",
      "Now, Mr. Trump is undermining HIV efforts by barring funds from programs built around diversity, equity, and inclusion. A Day One executive order said they represent \"immense public waste and shameful discrimination.\"",
      "Since then, his administration has cut millions of dollars in federal grants to health departments, universities, and nonprofit organizations that do HIV work. And in April, it eliminated half of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 10 HIV branch offices, according to an email to grant recipients, reviewed by KFF Health News, from the director of the CDC's Division of HIV Prevention. The layoffs included staff who had overseen the rollout of HIV grants to health departments and community-based groups, like My Brother's Keeper.",
      "The CDC provides more than 90% of all federal funding for HIV prevention \u2014 about $1 billion annually. The Trump administration's May 2 budget proposal for fiscal 2026 takes aim at DEI initiatives, including in its explanation for cutting $3.59 billion from the CDC. Although the proposal doesn't mention HIV prevention specifically, the administration's drafted plan for HHS, released mid-April, eliminates all prevention funding at the CDC, as well as funding for Mr. Trump's initiative to end the epidemic.",
      "Eliminating federal funds for HIV prevention would lead to more than 143,000 additional people in the U.S. becoming infected with HIV within five years, and about 127,000 additional people who die of AIDS-related causes, according to estimates from the Foundation for AIDS Research, a nonprofit known as amfAR. Excess medical costs would exceed $60 billion, it said.",
      "Eldridge Dwayne Ellis, the coordinator of the mobile testing clinic at My Brother's Keeper, said curbing the group's services goes beyond HIV.",
      "\"People see us as their only outlet, not just for testing but for confidential conversations, for a shoulder to cry on,\" he said. \"I don't understand how someone, with the stroke of a pen, could just haphazardly write off the health of millions.\"",
      "Quiet tears",
      "Ellis came into his role in the mobile clinic haphazardly, when he worked as a construction worker. Suddenly dizzy and unwell on a job, a co-worker suggested he visit the organization's brick-and-mortar clinic nearby. He later applied for a position with My Brother's Keeper, inspired by its efforts to give people support to help themselves.",
      "For example, Ellis described a young man who visited the mobile clinic recently who had been kicked out of his home and was sleeping on couches or on the street. Ellis thought of friends he'd known in similar situations that put them at risk of HIV by increasing the likelihood of transactional sex or substance use disorders.",
      "When a rapid test revealed HIV, the young man fell silent. \"The quiet tears hurt worse \u2014 it's the dread of mortality,\" Ellis said. \"I tried to be as strong as possible to let him know his life is not over, that this wasn't a death sentence.\"",
      "Ellis and his team enrolled the man into HIV care that day and stayed in touch. Otherwise, Ellis said, he might not have had the means or fortitude to seek treatment on his own and adhere to daily HIV pills. Not only is that deadly for people with HIV, it's bad for public health. HIV experts use the phrase \"treatment as prevention\" because most new infections derive from people who aren't adhering to treatment well enough to be considered virally suppressed \u2014 which keeps the disease from spreading.",
      "Only a third of people living with HIV in Mississippi were virally suppressed in 2022. Nationally, that number is about 65%. That's worse than in eastern and southern Africa, where 78% of people with HIV aren't spreading the virus because they're on steady treatment.",
      "My Brother's Keeper is one of many groups improving such numbers by helping people get tested and stay on medication. But the funding cuts in Washington have curtailed their work. The first loss was a $12 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, not even two years into a 10-year project. \"Programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry,\" the NIH said in a letter reviewed by KFF Health News.",
      "My Brother's Keeper then lost a CDC award to reduce health disparities \u2014 a grant channeled through the Mississippi state health department \u2014 that began with the group's work during the covid pandemic but had broadened to screening and care for HIV, heart disease, and diabetes. These are some of the maladies that account for why low-income Black people in the Deep South die sooner, on average, than those who are white. According to a recent study, the former's life expectancy was just 68 years in 2021, on par with the average in impoverished nations like Rwanda and Myanmar.",
      "The group then lost CDC funding that covered the cost of laboratory work to detect HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis in patients' blood samples. Mississippi has the highest rate of sexually transmitted diseases among states, in part because people spread infections when they aren't tested and treated.",
      "\"The labs are $200 to $600 per person,\" Gipson said, \"so now we can't do that without passing the cost to the patient, and some can't pay.\"",
      "Two other CDC grants on HIV prevention, together worth $841,000, were unusually delayed.",
      "Public health specialists close to the CDC, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation, said they were aware of delays in HIV prevention funding, despite court orders to unfreeze payments for federal grants in January and February. \"The faucet was being turned off at a higher level than at the CDC,\" one specialist said. The delays have now been compounded, they said, by the gutting of that agency's HIV workforce in April.",
      "\"I know of many organizations reliant on subcontracted federal funds who have not been paid for the work they've done, or whose funding has been terminated,\" said Dafina Ward, executive director of the Southern AIDS Coalition.",
      "To reach the underserved, these groups offer food, housing assistance, bus passes, disease screening, and a sense of community. A network of the groups was fostered, in part, by Mr. Trump's initiative to end the epidemic. And it showed promise: From 2017 to 2022, new HIV infections decreased by 21% in the cities and the Southern states it targeted.",
      "Disparities in infections were still massive, with the rate of HIV diagnoses about eight times as high for Black people as White people, and the South remained hardest hit. Ward was hopeful at the start of this year, however, as testing became more widespread and HIV prevention drugs \u2014 called preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP \u2014 slowly gained popularity. But her outlook has shifted and she fears that grassroots organizations might not weather the funding turmoil.",
      "\"We're seeing an about-face of what it means to truly work towards ending HIV in this country,\" she said.",
      "A closed clinic",
      "Southeast of Jackson, in Hattiesburg, Sean Fortenberry tears up as he walks into a small room used until recently for HIV testing. He has kept his job at Mississippi's AIDS Services Coalition by shifting his role but agonizes about the outcome. When Fortenberry tested positive for HIV in 2007, he said, his family and doctor saved his life.",
      "\"I never felt that I was alone, and that was really, really important,\" he said. \"Other people don't have that, so when I came across this position, I was gung-ho. I wanted to help.\"",
      "But the coalition froze its HIV testing clinic and paused mobile testing at homeless shelters, colleges, and churches late last year. Kathy Garner, the group's executive director, said the Mississippi health department \u2014 which funds the coalition with CDC's HIV prevention dollars \u2014 told her to pause outreach in October before the state renewed the group's annual HIV contract.",
      "Kendra Johnson, communicable diseases director at Mississippi's health department, said that delays in HIV prevention funds were initially on the department's end because it was short on administrative staff. Then Mr. Trump took office. \"We were working with our federal partners to ensure that our new objectives were in line with new HIV prevention activities,\" Johnson said. \"And we ran into additional delays due to paused communications at the federal level.\"",
      "The AIDS coalition remains afloat largely because of money from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program for treatment and from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \"If most of these federal dollars are cut, we would have to close,\" Garner said.",
      "The group provides housing or housing assistance to roughly 400 people each year. Research shows that people in stable housing adhere much better to HIV treatment and are far less likely to die than unhoused people with HIV.",
      "Funding cuts have shaken every state, but the South is acutely vulnerable when it comes to HIV, said Gregorio Millett, director of public policy at amfAR. Southern states have the highest level of poverty and a severe shortage of rural clinics, and several haven't expanded Medicaid so that more low-income adults have health insurance.",
      "Further, Southern states aren't poised to make up the difference. Alabama, Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Missouri put zero state funds into HIV prevention last year, according to NASTAD, an association of public health officials who administer HIV and hepatitis programs. In contrast, about 40% of Michigan's HIV prevention budget is provided by the state, 50% of Colorado's HIV prevention budget, and 88% of New York's.",
      "\"When you are in the South, you need the federal government,\" said Gipson, from My Brother's Keeper. \"When we had slavery, we needed the federal government. When we had the push for civil rights, we needed the federal government. And we still need the federal government for health care,\" she said. \"The red states are going to suffer, and we're going to start suffering sooner than anyone else.\"",
      "\"So goes Mississippi\"",
      "When asked about cuts and delays to HIV prevention funding, the CDC directed queries to HHS. The department's director of communications, Andrew Nixon, replied in an email: \"Critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue under the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA) as a part of Secretary [Robert F.] Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve the American people.\"",
      "Nixon did not reply to a follow-up question on whether the Trump administration considers HIV prevention critical.",
      "On April 4, Gipson received a fraction of her delayed HIV prevention funds from the CDC. But Gipson said she was afraid to hire back staff amid the turmoil.",
      "Like the directors of many other community organizations, Gipson is going after grants from foundations and companies. Pharmaceutical firms such as Gilead and GSK that produce HIV drugs are among the largest contributors of non-governmental funds for HIV testing, prevention, and care, but private funding for HIV has never come close to the roughly $40 billion that the federal government allocated to HIV annually.",
      "\"If the federal government withdraws some or all of its support, the whole thing will collapse,\" said Alice Riener, CEO of the community-based organization CrescentCare in Louisiana. \"What you see in Mississippi is the beginning of that, and what's so concerning is the infrastructure we've built will collapse quickly but take decades to rebuild.\"",
      "Southern health officials are reeling from cuts because state budgets are already tight. Mississippi's state health officer, Daniel Edney, spoke with KFF Health News on the day the Trump administration terminated $11 billion in COVID-era funds intended to help states improve their public health operations. \"There's not a lot of fat, and we're cutting it to the bone right now,\" Edney said.",
      "Mississippi needed this boost, Edney said, because the state ranks among the lowest in health metrics including premature death, access to clinical care, and teen births. But Edney noted hopeful trends: The state had recently moved from 50th to 49th worst in health rankings, and its rate of new HIV cases was dropping.",
      "\"The science tells us what we need to do to identify and care for patients, and we're improving,\" he said. \"But trends can change very quickly on us, so we can't take our foot off the gas pedal.\"",
      "If that happens, researchers say, the comeback of HIV will go unnoticed at first, as people at the margins of society are infected silently before they're hospitalized. As untreated infections spread, the rise will eventually grow large enough to make a dent in national statistics, a resurgence that will cost lives and take years, if not decades, to reverse.",
      "Outside the community center on that stormy March morning, pastor Devine lamented not just the loss of his grant from the health department, but a $1 billion cut to food distribution programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He rattled off consequences he feared: People relying on food assistance would be forced to decide between buying groceries, paying bills, or seeing a doctor, driving them further into poverty, into emergency rooms, into crime.",
      "Deja Abdul-Haqq, a program director at My Brother's Keeper, nodded along as he spoke. \"So goes Mississippi, so goes the rest of the United States,\" Abdul-Haqq said. \"Struggles may start here, but they spread.\"",

      "\"Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,\" Harris told Vogue. \"Artistic expression \u2014 whether it's dance, music, visual arts or fashion \u2014 has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.\"",

    "summary": "The IRS, hit by the Trump administration's federal workforce cuts, has lost 31% of its auditors through March, government watchdog finds.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in almost one-third of its tax auditors leaving the agency through March, according to a report from the U.S. Treasury Department's watchdog.",
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has sought to trim the federal workforce through a combination of layoffs and so-called deferred resignation. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla,\u00a0said\u00a0on the electric vehicle maker's April 22 earnings call that DOGE's efforts \"in addressing waste and fraud\" will \"get the country back on track.\"",
      "The IRS has been a focus of DOGE's cost-cutting efforts, with plans to trim as much as 40% of its workforce this year. Through March, those efforts have resulted in the tax agency losing about 11% of its workforce, the May 2 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found.",
      "But revenue agents \u2014 the IRS workers who perform audits \u2014 have seen a much bigger hit, with 31% of those workers, or about 3,600 auditors, taking either the deferred resignation plan or getting fired in the first three months of 2025, the report found. Losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, given that these agents typically handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers or corporations, experts say.",
      "\"You lose the very staff trained to keep high-end taxpayers and corporate tax payers in compliance,\" noted Emily DiVito, senior adviser on economic policy at the left-leaning Groundwork Collaborative and a former policy adviser at the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS.",
      "She added, \"You can see some behavioral effects when taxpayers, especially those that really don't want to pay their bills, come to accept there is very little risk to not paying at all, or even filing.\"",
      "Reached for comment, a Treasury spokeswoman said, \"The Biden Administration grew the IRS from 79,431 to 102,309 personnel. Under new leadership, approximately the same number of employees have left the IRS, with a vast majority leaving voluntarily through the Deferred Resignation Program. The roll back of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions are vital to improve both efficiency and quality of service. The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy, and customer service the American people deserve.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately return a request for comment about the TIGTA report.",
      "While the TIGTA report didn't explain why auditor departures outpaced that of overall cuts at the IRS, the tax agency had made an effort under the Biden administration to hire more auditors in order to beef up revenue collection. In February 2024, the IRS had said it expected to collect hundreds of billions in additional taxes after using funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire more auditors.",
      "Because the DOGE cuts have focused on firing so-called \"probationary workers,\" or junior federal employees who typically have less than a year or two on the job, there may have been more newly hired auditors who were impacted by the reductions, DeVito said.",
      "Reducing federal revenue?",
      "Auditing wealthy Americans and corporations can be lucrative for the federal government. In fiscal year 2023, auditors recommended an additional $32 billion in tax assessments, the TIGTA report said.",
      "And every $1 spent on auditing the top 0.1% of earners can return about $26 in tax revenue, according to an analysis from Better IRS, an advocacy group for free tax filing.",
      "The cuts to the IRS' auditing force raises questions about the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, given that the tax agency is responsible for collecting the bulk of the nation's revenue, DeVito added.",
      "The combination of individual and corporate income taxes provides about 60 cents for every $1 in federal revenue, with the remaining 40 cents coming from payroll taxes and fees, such as paying admission to national parks, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "DOGE's cost-cutting efforts may end up costing almost as much as they've saved, according to an analysis last month from the nonpartisan research group the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "DOGE claims to have saved $165 billion, but the Partnership for Public Service estimates that the savings have come at a cost of $135 billion due to paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity. That figure also excludes the impact of multiple lawsuits filed against DOGE's actions, as well as lost tax revenue due to IRS cuts, the group said.",
      "The IRS could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an\u00a0estimate\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"The argument from DOGE is to save money \u2014 that if we don't have as big of a federal workforce, then we are saving the government money,\" DeVito said. But given the potential to lose out on tax revenue, the IRS reduction \"simply doesn't make sense,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration said Monday it would cut off all new federal research grants to Harvard University in the latest escalation of its battle with the school.",
      "In a letter, Education Secretary Linda McMahon tells the Ivy League university that it is not eligible for any new federal grants until it meets the administration's demands and \"demonstrates responsible management of the university.\"",
      "The two-page letter to the university's president calls out what the administration views as Harvard's \"systemic pattern of violating federal law.\" McMahon accuses Harvard of ignoring antisemitism, engaging in discrimination, abandoning \"any semblance of academic rigor\" and \"disastrous mismanagement.\"",
      "\"The above concerns are only a fraction of the long list of Harvard's consistent violations of its own legal duties,\" McMahon wrote. \"Given these and other concerning allegations, this letter is to inform you that Harvard should no longer seek GRANTS from the federal government, since none will be provided.\"",
      "Federal student loan funding and Pell Grants are not affected by the move, according to a senior Education Department official.",
      "In a statement, Harvard accused the administration of \"doubling down on demands that would impose unprecedented and improper control over Harvard University and would have chilling implications for higher education.\"",
      "It said McMahon's letter threatened to \"illegally withhold funding for lifesaving research and innovation in retaliation against Harvard for filing its lawsuit on April 21,\" referring to the\u00a0lawsuit Harvard filed\u00a0after the Trump administration announced it would freeze\u00a0$2.2 billion\u00a0in grants and $60 million in contracts to the university.",
      "\"Harvard will continue to comply with the law, promote and encourage respect for viewpoint diversity, and combat antisemitism in our community. Harvard will also continue to defend against illegal government overreach aimed at stifling research and innovation that make Americans safer and more secure,\" the statement said.",
      "Last week, President Trump said his administration would rescind the university's tax-exempt status, though he did not provide further details. Harvard president Alan Garber said such a move would be \"highly illegal,\" in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. U.S.\u00a0tax code\u00a0prohibits executive branch officials from asking an IRS employee to conduct or terminate an audit or investigation into a specific taxpayer.",
      "The administration froze grants to Harvard after it\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, discipline student protesters, and audit students and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" Harvard alleged that the government's action violated its constitutional rights and was part of a \"pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has approached far-flung countries to aid its mass deportation effort, asking nations like Angola and Equatorial Guinea to accept migrants who are not their citizens, according to internal federal government documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "The talks are part of an intense diplomatic campaign by the Trump administration to convince as many nations as possible \u2014 including those with controversial human rights records \u2014 to receive deportees from the U.S., such as migrants whose home countries won't take them back.",
      "The administration has already brokered agreements with several Latin American countries willing to accept migrants who are not their own. In February, the U.S. deported hundreds of African and Asian migrants to Costa Rica and Panama. In March, the Trump administration sent nearly 300 Venezuelans accused of being gang members to El Salvador, which imprisoned them at an infamous mega-prison.",
      "Guatemala has also agreed to take in third country deportees from the U.S. The Mexican government, under a deal that preceded Mr. Trump's second term, has been receiving migrants from other Latin American countries, like Venezuela, caught crossing the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "But behind the scenes, the Trump administration has been negotiating with countries outside of the Western Hemisphere to send migrants thousands of miles away, across the Atlantic Ocean, to places in Africa and Europe.",
      "The Eastern Hemisphere countries that the Trump administration has identified as places that could potentially accept deportations of third country nationals include Angola, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Libya, Moldova and Rwanda, according to the internal government documents and officials. The U.S. has yet to announce any formal deals with these nations.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported on the internal talks with some of these countries in April. The negotiations with Angola and Equatorial Guinea have not been previously reported.",
      "It's unclear who exactly would be sent to the third countries if any deportation arrangements are finalized. But one of the ideas under consideration, the internal government documents show, would be for the U.S. to use the agreements to deport suspected members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang Mr. Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "How deportees would be treated by governments that are not their own is also an open question. As part of its arrangement with El Salvador, for example, the U.S. agreed to give the Salvadoran government millions of dollars to detain Venezuelans deemed to be Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security referred questions about the deportation negotiations, and how the potential agreements would work, to the Department of State, which did not immediately comment on CBS News' reporting.",
      "The embassies of Benin, Eswatini, Libya, Moldova and Rwanda did not respond to requests for comment. A representative for the embassy of Equatorial Guinea said the \"Embassy is not aware of any such conversations going on between the two governments.\"",
      "On Monday, after CBS News published its story, a spokesperson for the Angolan Embassy in the U.S. said, \"Angola has stated that it is not accepting deported individuals of other nationalities.\"",
      "In recent years, Western countries bedeviled by migration crises and the accompanying political backlash have sought to forge diplomatic agreements that allow them to re-route migrants and asylum-seekers to third countries.",
      "The first Trump administration convinced El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to sign \"safe third country\" deals that allowed the U.S. to divert migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border to those countries; though only one of the deals was implemented before they were scrapped by the Biden administration.",
      "In 2022, the United Kingdom brokered a \"safe third country\" deal with Rwanda, but it was ultimately discontinued amid intense controversy and legal challenges. Under another arrangement, Albania agreed to host migrants in Italian custody, though that effort has been partially blocked by judges.",
      "Andrew Selee, the president of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based research group, said there are many legal, political and humanitarian questions about the agreements the Trump administration is considering, including whether the U.S. will try to ensure deportees are not mistreated in the receiving countries.",
      "A court ruling from April prohibited the Trump administration from sending deportees to a third country without informing them of the destination and allowing them to be screened for any concerns they have about being harmed there.",
      "But Selee said the deportation deals, even if they're limited in scope or held up in court, are principally designed to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"It sends a message that will scare off people from coming unauthorized to the U.S.,\" Selee said. \"And it allows them to say that they can deport people from any nationality somewhere.\"",
      "Standing alongside Mr. Trump during a White House cabinet meeting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the Trump administration was \"actively searching for other countries to take people from third countries.\"",
      "\"We are working with other countries to say, 'we want to send you some of the most despicable human beings to your countries,'\" Rubio said. \"'Would you do that, as a favor to us? And the further away from America, the better.'\"",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 19:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration said a lawsuit involving the abortion pill mifepristone that was brought by three GOP-led states should be dismissed.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Monday urged a federal district court to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration's actions expanding access to the widely used abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing with the U.S. district court in Amarillo, Texas, that the three states pursuing the lawsuit \u2014 Missouri, Idaho and Kansas \u2014 should not be able to do so in that court. The administration is pursuing a request initially made by the Biden administration last year in the closely watched challenge to mifepristone, a drug used to terminate an early pregnancy, that has been playing out before U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk.",
      "\"At bottom, the states cannot keep alive a lawsuit in which the original plaintiffs were held to lack standing, those plaintiffs have now voluntarily dismissed their claims, and the states' own claims have no connection to this district,\" Trump administration lawyers wrote. \"The states are free to pursue their claims in a district where venue is proper, but the states' claims before this court must be dismissed or transferred pursuant to the venue statute's mandatory command.\"",
      "The legal battle over mifepristone was initially filed by a group of anti-abortion rights doctors and medical associations in November 2022. The coalition sought to roll back a series of changes made by the FDA that relaxed the rules for the drug's use. But the Supreme Court last year rejected that challenge and unanimously ruled that the plaintiffs did not have the legal right to sue, a concept known as legal standing.",
      "But attorneys general for Missouri, Idaho and Kansas, who had intervened at an earlier stage in the litigation, sought to continue the lawsuit. They argued that changes made by the FDA beginning in 2016 were unlawful. Among those efforts were allowing mifepristone to be taken up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy, rather than seven weeks, expanding the health care providers who can prescribe the drug and allowing the medication to be dispensed through the mail.",
      "The Justice Department said in its filing to Kacsmaryk, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, that the states' claims \"have no connection\" to the Northern District of Texas, where the case was filed, and that even if they were to file their own lawsuit there, it could not move forward because it is not the proper venue.",
      "\"Regardless of the merits of the states' claims, the states cannot proceed in this court,\" administration lawyers said. \"The states' amended complaint should be dismissed or transferred for lack of venue.\"",
      "The Justice Department also said the states do not have the legal standing to sue and waited too long to challenge the FDA's 2016 actions, which are subject to a six-year statute of limitations. The FDA first approved mifepristone in 2000 and has issued a series of changes in the years since that have made the drug more widely available.",
      "Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023, according to a study from the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group. Twenty-eight states restrict access to mifepristone, according to the organization, four of which prohibit the mailing of abortion pills to patients.",
      "The filing from the Trump administration is the first in which it has expressed a position on the challenge involving mifepristone. After Mr. Trump won a second term in office, conservatives urged his administration to force the FDA to roll back its earlier moves that made mifepristone easier to obtain.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0told senators during his confirmation hearing earlier this year that Mr. Trump had asked him to study the safety of mifepristone. Kennedy, whose agency oversees the FDA, said that while the president had not taken a stand on how to regulate the abortion pill, he would implement the president's policies.",
      "The president said in June 2024 that he had \"strong views\"\u00a0on mifepristone and pledged to release a policy position on access to the drug, but did not do so.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security said it has helped some migrants obtain plane tickets so they can return to their native countries in the next two weeks. A migrant has already returned to Honduras using the self-deportation program to book a flight out of Chicago, the department added.",
      "Those interested in participating in the self-deportation initiative are being instructed to use a government smartphone app now known as CBP Home \u2014 which the Biden administration previously used to allow certain migrants to enter the U.S. legally \u2014 to tell officials they plan to leave the country.",
      "Eligible immigrants will receive both travel assistance and the $1,000 stipend, which DHS officials said will be paid after the U.S. government confirms the individual has left the country.",
      "The Trump administration said those who sign up for self-deportation using the CBP Home app will be deprioritized for arrest and detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \"as long as they demonstrate they are making meaningful strides in completing that departure.\"",
      "The incentives offered on Monday are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to push unauthorized immigrants \u2014 with both sticks and carrots \u2014 to leave the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has threatened certain unauthorized immigrants with prosecution, jail time and fines if they fail to register with the federal government. It has also dramatically broadened whom ICE deportation officers can target for arrest, reversing Biden-era rules that largely limited immigration arrests to serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals.",
      "In its announcement Monday, the Trump administration portrayed self-deportation as a \"dignified way\" to leave the U.S., given that the alternative could be a forced deportation after being detained by ICE agents.",
      "But the self-deportation push also helps the government conserve resources and money. As currently staffed and resourced, ICE does not have the personnel, detention space and assets to find, arrest, detain and deport the millions of immigrants estimated to be in the country without authorization.",
      "DHS officials argued on Monday that the travel assistance and stipend would also save the U.S. government money, saying that arresting, detaining and deporting a migrant costs $17,121, on average.",
      "DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the Trump administration has tracked \"thousands\" of self-deportations so far.",
      "The Trump administration has repeatedly said those who participate in the self-deportation campaign may be able to come back to the U.S. legally in the future. But seeking permission to enter the U.S. legally is often a lengthy, complicated and expensive process, and poor and destitute individuals without any family or employers in the U.S. generally don't qualify for a visa. Additionally, those who leave the U.S. after being in the country illegally for over a year could face a 10-year ban on reentry.",

      "Over a dozen states sued the Trump administration Monday for laying off thousands of Health and Human Services staffers, urging a court to reverse job cuts that they argue brought work at large swaths of the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-led health agency to a \"sudden halt.\"",
      "The lawsuit \u2014\u00a0filed in Rhode Island federal court by New York, California, 17 other states and Washington, D.C. \u2014 claims the Trump administration has sought to \"dismantle\" HHS through layoffs that disproportionately hit \"disfavored work and programs,\" like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "HHS is aiming to cut its headcount by 20,000 \u2014 or nearly 25% \u2014 through a combination of layoffs, buyouts and early retirement offers, the department announced in March, framing it as a \"dramatic restructuring\" aimed at making HHS more efficient and cutting redundant or unnecessary services. The cuts are part of a wider initiative by the Trump administration, led by billionaire Elon Musk, to slash the size of the federal government.",
      "Since then, thousands of HHS staff have gotten layoff notices. The cuts have hit large agencies like the FDA and CDC, along with departments that handle mental health, federal poverty guidelines and other services, CBS News has previously reported. Deep cuts are also slated for the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Monday's lawsuit, which names Kennedy and other HHS leaders as defendants, argues these job cuts have \"systematically deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job.\"",
      "The layoffs have allegedly cut off the states from data and made it harder to access grants for everything from worker safety to the Head Start preschool program, the lawsuit argues. The suit also says the agency has shuttered key disease\u00a0testing labs, forcing them to \"find new partners to handle their most difficult testing needs that had previously been handled by the CDC.\"",
      "The states are asking a federal judge to halt Kennedy's directive to reorganize and cut the HHS, arguing the moves exceed HHS's legal authority and violate the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine by slashing programs authorized by Congress.",
      "The suit also takes aim at Kennedy's views, citing his vaccine skepticism and \"history of advocating for the evisceration of the Department's statutorily mandated work promoting public health.\" It also pointed to Kennedy's acknowledgement that 20% of job cuts at the HHS may need to be reversed due to \"mistakes.\"",
      "An HHS spokesperson said in response to the lawsuit, \"HHS remains confident that the process will withstand legal scrutiny.\"",
      "\"We are following the law, period. Nothing has been rushed and multiple rounds of discussions between divisions and HHS occurred before the announcement. Every step taken has been deliberate, collaborative, and consistent with federal personnel policy and civil service protections,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson also defended changes to the agency, saying they \"are designed to strengthen the agency's capacity to serve the American public, not weaken it.\"",
      "Monday's suit is the latest legal action against the Trump administration's cost-cutting drive. Almost two dozen states sued HHS last month for cutting public health grants, and labor unions have sued the government over cuts to other agencies.",

Raphael Warnock was reelected by fewer than three points in 2022, beating Trump-backed ex-football star Herschel Walker.",

      "The five living former National Weather Service leaders wrote and released an open letter to the American people warning about the impact of staffing and program cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, saying their \"worst nightmare\" is the cuts will lead to \"needless loss of life.\"",
      "Since the beginning of the year, more than 550 employees have left the National Weather Service, leaving it down 10% of its staffing levels ahead of hurricane season and the busiest time of year. And the proposed budget released by the White House will cut NOAA, the parent agency of the National Weather Service, by nearly 30%, virtually eliminating NOAA's research functions for weather, limiting ocean data observations and decreasing funding for new satellites, they said.",
      "The five signatories \u2014 Louis Uccellini, Jack Hayes, Brigadier General D.L. Johnson, Brigadier General John J. Kelly Jr. and E.W. (Joe) Friday \u2014 worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "\"Our worst nightmare is that weather forecast offices will be so understaffed that there will be needless loss of life,\" their letter said. \"We know that's a nightmare shared by those on the forecasting front lines \u2014 and by the people who depend on their efforts.\"",
      "Some forecast offices might be so short-staffed they have to function only part-time, they warned.",
      "\"The Houston office has lost all three of its senior meteorologists,\" Friday told CBS News. \"We have many offices across the country that are now having to close at night because they don't have sufficient staff,\" he said.",
      "Friday pointed to the Easter-weekend storms and floods in Oklahoma that killed two people, which he said could have been forecasted better.",
      "\"Those are things that are going to happen with more and more stress on the organization,\" he said.",
      "Friday said they hope to impress the urgency of the situation upon congressional leaders and the public.",
      "\"It is very unusual that all five of us former directors have agreed upon anything,\" said Friday, who is 86 years old and retired, living in Oklahoma. But collectively, the group felt it was important to the organization and science to share the message, he said.",
      "Specifically, the former NWS directors warned that staffing cuts could have ramifications for airplanes that can't fly without accurate weather observations and forecasts, and ships that rely on storm forecasts to avoid dangerous high seas. Farmers also rely on seasonal forecasts to plant and harvest, they noted.",
      "\"As former directors of the National Weather Service, we know firsthand what it takes to make accurate forecasts happen and we stand united against the loss of staff and resources at NWS and are deeply concerned about NOAA as a whole. Join us and raise your voice too,\" the letter said.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 05:00:19 -0400",
    "summary": "In recent weeks, Social Security has been plagued by problems related to technology, system errors, and even the marking of living people as dead.",
    "story": [
      "Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people.",
      "They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom \"there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.\" So employees have to \"resurrect\" them \u2014 affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits.",
      "Revivals were \"sporadic\" before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. \"In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,\" he said.",
      "It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead \"impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.\"",
      "\"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.",
      "Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\"",
      "Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said.",
      "The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.",
      "But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.",
      "Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer \u2014 whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record \u2014 believes they could be zero.",
      "Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.",
      "Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.",
      "The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\"",
      "Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.",
      "While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.",
      "For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to a January survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance.",
      "Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.",
      "Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\"",
      "When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient.",
      "\"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.",
      "Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.",
      "A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security \u2014 which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 \u2014 had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.",
      "Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.",
      "\"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\"",
      "What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.",
      "She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.",
      "Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored \u2014 the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.",
      "\"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency.",
      "Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\"",
      "The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which \"the problems surface first,\" Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, \"those things languish.\"",
      "Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program.",
      "Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks \"just sit there.\"",
      "Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and \"those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,\" putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said.",
      "Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. \"There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,\" said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said.",
      "The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. \"It's more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it's underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,\" he said.",

      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek, a lecturer at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph, if it remains intact.",
      "\"While not without risk, we should not be too worried,\" Langbroek said in an email.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\"",
      "Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian, told NPR that the spacecraft is making its \"final death plunge.\"",
      "\"I expect it'll have the usual one-in-several-thousand chance of hitting someone,\" McDowell wrote last month. \"No need for major concern, but you wouldn't want it bashing you on the head.\"",
      "Kosmos 482 launched in 1972",
      "The Soviet Union launched Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth's orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",

      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",

But light from the waxing moon will wash out the fainter meteors this year, according to Bill Cooke, who leads NASA's Meteoroid Environments Office. Viewers can expect 10-15 meteors per hour just before dawn on Tuesday morning.",

      "Forests on Earth collectively absorb and store about 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, the ESA said. That regulates the planet's temperature. Deforestation and degradation, especially in tropical regions, means that stored carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, the ESA said, which can contribute to climate change. There's a lack of accurate data on how much carbon the planet's estimated 1.5 trillion trees store and how much human activity can impact that storage, the ESA said.",
      "To \"weigh\" the planet's trees and determine their carbon dioxide capacity, Biomass will use a P-band synthetic aperture radar. It's the first such piece of technology in space. The radar can penetrate forest canopies and measure woody biomass, including trunks, branches and stems, the ESA said. Most forest carbon is stored in these parts of the trees. Those measurements will act as a proxy for carbon storage, the ESA said.",

      "In Smith's case, an image of her was doctored to create explicit pictures and videos, with her face edited onto different, partly nude bodies, and then used to try to extort money from others. \"Sextortion\" scams like this one have targeted tens of thousands of Americans in the past year alone, according to the FBI.",
      "\"I cry myself to sleep most nights, mostly because I don't want my kids to see me,\" said Smith, who is 43.

      "The deepfakes quickly multiplied, accompanying offers for private dinners and intimate acts in exchange for hundreds of dollars, and targeting anyone who might recognize Smith.

And last week, a bill Smith backed passed in the Tennessee Senate. The bill, called the \"Preventing Deepfake Images Act,\" was sent to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who is expected to sign it into law. It provides a path for people targeted by sextortion scams to sue if images of them are shared without their consent.",

      "Johnson on Tuesday expressed confidence that the lower chamber would complete its work by Memorial Day, a day after acknowledging to reporters that he put the package on a \"very ambitious time table\" and that the self-imposed deadline could slip past the holiday.",
      "\"We can pass that by Memorial Day. That was our original timeframe,\" he said.",
      "Committees face a May 9 deadline to complete their committee work under the budget resolution that the House and Senate adopted in April. But Johnson said the plan is to have committees complete their work and send the components of the bill to the House Budget Committee, which will incorporate the recommendations for the government's spending into a massive legislative package, by the end of next week.",
      "The House Energy and Commerce Committee had been targeting a Wednesday markup, but the panel has yet to schedule one. The House Ways and Means Committee and Agriculture Committee have yet to complete their work as well.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with identifying the biggest spending cuts \u2014 at least $880 billion over the next decade. The effort has become among the most closely watched in the reconciliation process, as Republicans look to dispel concerns about cuts to the popular entitlement program, stressing that they intend solely to root out waste, fraud and abuse, while some GOP hard-liners seek deeper spending cuts.",
      "Meanwhile, disagreements over the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, have come before the Ways and Means Committee, as conservatives oppose a push to increase the cap from Republicans in blue states. Still, Ways and Means Committee chairman Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, said Sunday on Fox News that House Republicans will \"get the job done,\" adding that \"failure is simply not an option.\"",
      "\"We're going to find the equilibrium point on SALT that no one will be totally delighted with, but it'll solve the equation, and we'll get it done,\" Johnson said Monday, referring to the deduction by its acronym.",
      "Johnson said Monday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump that day about budget reconciliation, and he noted that leadership is meeting with groups of members in the GOP conference on Tuesday as they try to push forward on the process.",
      "At his Tuesday news conference, Johnson was asked whether he has made assurances to the moderate and conservative factions of his conference that he can't keep.",
      "\"I don't make promises that I can't keep. This is a consensus building operation,\" he said. \"We've been working really hard to take all the input and find that kind of equilibrium point where everybody is at least satisfied. Some people are not going to be elated by every provision of the bill. It's impossible. The bill is one big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, told members in their morning meeting that they need to \"focus on the totality of the bill and not just individual details,\" according to Johnson.",
      "But Scalise also alluded to the plan slipping beyond Memorial Day, telling reporters Tuesday after the Republican conference meeting that \"we're on track to continue to deliver on this one big, beautiful bill and get it through the process and ideally to get it on the president's desk in June.\"",
      "Lawmakers also cast doubt on whether they could meet the Memorial Day deadline.",
      "\"That's wishful thinking, I guess,\" Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, said. \"But you know, when I raised the speed limit in Tennessee to 70, I asked for 85. And 70 is what I wanted, so.\"",
      "Rep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican, said \"the fact that we're having the conversation is good,\" but he added that \"we've got to act.\"",

    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is meeting with President Trump at the White House Tuesday for the first time since taking office\u00a0in March and pledging to stand firm against the U.S. president.",
      "Mr. Trump began their meeting in the Oval Office by congratulating Carney on his victory, saying, \"I think I was probably the greatest thing that happened to him.\"",
      "\"We're gonna be friends with Canada,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office. \"Regardless of anything, we're going to be friends with Canada.\"",
      "U.S.-Canada relations have been strained by Mr. Trump's tariffs and his comments about making Canada the 51st state. Carney said in his victory speech that Canada's previous relationship with the U.S., \"based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation, is over.\" He also said Canadians must \"fundamentally reimagine our economy\" in light of Mr. Trump's tariff regime.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, Carney told the BBC last week that Canada would only enter trade and security talks with the Trump administration \"on our terms.\" Carney, a member of the Liberal Party, was elected party leader in March and became the prime minister soon after.",
      "A 25% import tariff on goods from Canada not covered by the USMCA trade agreement went into effect March 4. Mr. Trump said that tariff was to punish Canada for the entrance of fentanyl and migrants into the U.S. Last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border, while over 21,000 pounds of the drug was seized at the southern border. Canada retaliated against the U.S. with tariffs on many U.S. goods.",
      "\"We don't need their Cars, we don't need their Energy, we don't need their Lumber, we don't need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship, which hopefully we will always maintain,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media ahead of Carney's arrival. \"They, on the other hand, need EVERYTHING from us!\"",
      "Over the weekend, Mr. Trump said he'd talk about making Canada the 51st state, although he said he doesn't expect to use military force. \"I don't see it with Canada. I just don't see it,\" the president said in an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "Carney said he won't be discussing Canadian statehood with Mr. Trump. The prime minister also said Mr. Trump did not suggest Canada should become the 51st U.S. state in their most recent phone call.",
      "\"It's always important to distinguish want from reality,\" Carney said last week, adding, \"What the Canadian people clearly have stated, virtually without exception, is this will never, never happen.\"",

During a search of the area, police found a damaged cell phone that allegedly belonged to Parisano, according to police.",

    "summary": "A federal appellate panel will hear arguments on where and whether Mohsen Mahdawi and Rumesya Ozturk should be detained as cases challenging their confinements proceed.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appellate panel on Tuesday considered high-profile cases involving two international students who were detained by federal immigration officials and now face removal from the U.S. after they made statements that were critical of Israel.",
      "The panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit heard arguments in emergency appeals from the Trump administration after two federal judges issued separate decisions in favor of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, and Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student at Columbia University, last month.",
      "Administration officials are asking the 2nd Circuit to pause the lower court orders issued in Ozturk and Mahdawi's cases while their challenges to their respective detentions move forward. In Ozturk's case, U.S. District Judge William Sessions issued an order for Ozturk, who is being detained at a facility in Louisiana, to be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in Vermont and set a bail hearing for her to attend in person on May 9.",
      "U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered Mahdawi's release from immigration custody while the challenge to his detention proceeds.",
      "Appeals court Judges Barrington Parker, Susan Carney and Alison Nathan weighed the administration's request for a stay of the two orders, and said following arguments that they will take the matters under advisement.",
      "The cases are still in their early stages, and the lower court judges, Sessions and Crawford, are still weighing Ozturk and Mahdawi's respective habeas corpus challenges to their confinement. But a key issue in the two cases is untangling the removal proceedings playing out in immigration court from the challenges to their detentions that were filed in federal court, and what is required in each of those cases.",
      "Ozturk, a Ph.D. student at Tufts, was arrested by federal immigration officials near her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment on March 25, after the Trump administration revoked her student visa. She was not notified of the revocation before her arrest, according to court records.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in March that at least 300 students studying at American universities have had their visas rescinded after they were accused of expressing support for Palestinians or participating in campus protests.",
      "Ozturk co-authored an editorial in the Tufts' student newspaper that criticized the school for its dismissal of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate as a \"sincere effort to hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\" The editorial did not mention Hamas.",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, Esha Bhandari, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Ozturk, said her client has been \"held behind bars for six weeks while her health deteriorates for writing an op-ed.\" All she is asking for is for the temporary transfer order to be completed as court proceedings play out in Vermont, Bhandari said.",
      "\"The executive branch made a specific decision to detain Ms. Ozturk because of her speech,\" she said.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in part that the district court in Vermont does not have jurisdiction over Ozturk's habeas petition because it was not filed where she is confined \u2014 Louisiana \u2014 and did not name her immediate custodian as a defendant \u2014 the warden at the detention center.",
      "But Bhandari argued that the executive branch effectively suspended the writ of habeas corpus on its own by refusing to specify to Ozturk's lawyers who had custody of her, which would have allowed them to name that person as the defendant in Ozturk's challenge to her detention.",
      "Bhandari called the government's position \"breathtaking.\"",
      "According to court filings, a memorandum from a senior official with the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs said Ozturk's visa was revoked based on a request from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, which determined that she \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization.'\"",
      "After she was arrested, Ozturk was transported to Methuen, Massachusetts, and transported to Lebanon, New Hampshire, followed by St. Albans, Vermont, where she was kept overnight. On the morning of March 26, in Burlington, Vermont, Ozturk was put on a plane and flown to Louisiana, where she is currently in custody at an immigration facility in Basile.",
      "Ozturk's lawyers filed a petition challenging her arrest and detention as a violation of the First and Fifth Amendments in federal district court in Massachusetts. But the case was transferred to Sessions' court in Vermont after it was determined that Ozturk was detained in that state at the time the petition was filed.",
      "The Justice Department sought to dismiss Ozturk's petition while her lawyers asked Sessions to order her to be released or transferred to Vermont while her claims are adjudicated.",
      "Sessions last month ruled that Ozturk's arrest and detention raised \"significant constitutional concerns\" and said she must be transferred to ICE custody in Vermont by May 1. He also set a bail hearing for May 9, with Ozturk appearing in person, and will consider the merits of her habeas petition on May 22.",
      "The 2nd Circuit temporarily paused Sessions' order late last month while it considers the Trump administration's request for emergency relief.",
      "Mahdawi, who is to graduate from Columbia this month with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, was detained by immigration agents in Vermont last month during what he was told was his citizenship interview.",
      "He was born in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and he has held a green card for the last 10 years and co-founded his university's Palestinian Student Union, alongside Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, Columbia Ph.D. student and U.S. resident detained by the government. Mahdawi's attorneys said he took a \"step back\" from the high-profile protests at the school before students began occupying university buildings.",
      "Khalil, a Palestinian born in Syria, was a vocal member of last year's protests at Columbia. He was arrested by ICE in March. He is also challenging his removal and detention, though an immigration judge allowed the government to proceed with its effort to deport Khalil.",
      "In an interview with CBS News the day before his arrest, Mahdawi called the interview a \"honey trap\" that allowed federal immigration officials to detain him while he went in to pursue U.S. citizenship.",
      "Mahdawi's attorneys secured a court order that blocked the Trump administration from deporting him or moving him outside of Vermont. Then, last week, Crawford released Mahdawi from federal detention as his immigration proceedings continue and again barred the government from removing him from the state or country.",
      "A U.S. attorney arguing against Mahdawi's release said that keeping him in detention would be a \"constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process\" and argued in court filings that Mahdawi's \"presence and activities\" in the U.S. \"have serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" if he remains here.",
      "But Naz Ahmad, who argued on Mahdawi's behalf before the 2nd Circuit, told the judges that the government's detention of her client was \"retaliatory\" and had not only chilled his speech, but also others. He is challenging his detention as a violation of the First and First Amendments.",
      "If the 2nd Circuit grants the Justice Department's request for the stay in Mahdawi's case, it would allow immigration authorities to re-detain him. But two of the judges on the panel seemed to question how the government is harmed by the lower court's decision ordering Mahdawi's release.",
      "Barrington asked Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, whether an \"adverse\" decision constitutes irreparable harm to the government. Irreparable harm is one of four factors courts analyze when considering whether to grant a stay of a lower court order.",
      "Ensign mentioned operational costs to the government that would arise from Mahdawi having to participate in immigration proceedings, which are being held separately in Louisiana, from Vermont.",
      "One of the judges noted that in both Mahdawi and Ozturk's cases, the district court judges have indicated a \"strong desire\" to move quickly when considering the challenges to their allegedly unlawful detentions.",
      "The Trump administration has been cracking down on U.S. universities and their students who were involved in pro-Palestinian protests waged after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, which triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order in January that ordered his administration to use \"all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\" The White House said that these efforts would include deporting alleged \"Hamas sympathizers\" and revoking student visas.",

      "Major delays and cancellations that have been plaguing travelers coming in and out of\u00a0Newark Liberty International Airport\u00a0in New Jersey in the past week could continue well into the next week and beyond if multiple issues, including staffing shortages and equipment malfunctions, aren't solved.",
      "The main issue that kick-started a chain of delays came after a number of system outages, including when controllers' screens essentially went dark for up to 90 seconds \u2014 causing them to lose the ability to track aircraft at a key facility handling traffic in and out of Newark.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration has issued several ground delays and ground stops at the airport, which is located just outside New York City and is among the busiest airports in the country. At one point, arriving flights were delayed as long as six hours, while departures faced nearly four-hour delays, CBS New York reported.",
      "\"Our antiquated air traffic control system is affecting our workforce,\" the FAA said in a statement.",
      "The FAA has blamed equipment outages and\u00a0staffing levels in Philadelphia, where the air traffic control center that oversees Newark's airspace is based, as well as\u00a0runway construction.",
      "Here's what travelers should know about the issues at the 12th busiest airport in the U.S.",
      "Air traffic control staffing shortage",
      "One of the reasons Newark airport has been dealing with disruptions and long wait times for more than a week is due to air traffic control staffing shortage, according to the FAA.",
      "The staffing shortages at a terminal air traffic control facility in Philadelphia, officially known as Terminal Radar Approach Control or TRACON, reduced the facility's ability to provide approach control services to aircraft arriving, departing, or transiting the airspace.",
      "The FAA said it instituted a \"flow constrained area\" \u2014 a line in space that is drawn across a specific area that air traffic controllers are monitoring after traffic had reached a point where it is considered to be a potential issue \u2014 in Newark due to the Philadelphia TRACON staffing. It means traffic managers have to look at possible ways of metering the air traffic across the area to ensure that it does not exceed what controllers can actually handle, the National Business Aviation Association explained.",
      "When the staffing gets low, the FAA runs what's called an Airspace Flow Program, which is a traffic management program that consists of delaying flights to spread out the traffic so that available staffing can safely handle the demand.",
      "\"I think our industry is all about mitigating safety risk,\" Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci told CBS News' chief transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"So what you do is you slow things down, you slow things down so you can operate safely. But those delays are just too long.\"",
      "The Philadelphia TRACON has been guiding some air traffic at Newark after the agency relocated a group of controllers there from New York last year in an effort to help staffing overall. It is part of a nationwide problem with more than 90% of country's airport towers are staffed below FAA standards, according to a CBS News analysis earlier this year.",
      "Equipment issues, \"lost radar,\" staff on trauma leave",
      "Late last week, 20% of air traffic controllers in Philadelphia called out of work, citing trauma due to equipment outages and frustration with\u00a0the ongoing issues, a source familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a union representing air traffic controllers and other aviation workers nationwide, said in a statement that Philadelphia TRACON workers \"did not 'walk off the job' as it has been reported by the media.\"",
      "Around the major time delays began last week, the air traffic controllers on April 28 \"temporarily lost radar and communications with the aircraft under their control, unable to see, hear, or talk to them,\" the union said in the statement on May 5.",
      "\"Due to the event, the controllers took absence under the Federal Employees Compensation Act. This program covers all federal employees that are physically injured or experience a traumatic event on the job,\" the union said.",
      "\"Frequent equipment and telecommunications outages can be stressful for controllers,\" the FAA said in a statement. \"Some controllers at the Philadelphia TRACON who work Newark arrivals and departures have taken time off to recover from the stress of multiple recent outages.\"",
      "The controllers who are out in trauma leave can take up to 45 days off, if a medical professional signs off, but they don't have to take the full time.",
      "On May 2, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy traveled to the Philadelphia TRACON facility following a visit by FAA officials earlier in the week to try to get a better direct understanding of the situation. There are concerns the issues may linger beyond a week.",
      "\"When we talk about Newark, specifically in the outage or the interruption, we want to make sure that equipment is solid for the controllers that are coming to work every day, so that they can depend on that they depend on that equipment and making sure they're properly trained,\" acting FAA administrator Chris Rocheleau said at a news conference.",
      "Asked about the Newark outage, Minicucci, the Alaska Airlines CEO, said, \"I believe our industry is safe.\" But he continued, \"The area we have to focus on is air traffic control.\"",
      "\"You know, we have old equipment and infrastructure, a lot of towers that need to be updated and modernized. And I think there's a huge opportunity with technology,\" he said, including the use of artificial intelligence to help reduce delays and increase efficiency and safety.",
      "\"I think Secretary Duffy has the priorities very well established, you know: staffing, infrastructure, technology. Those are three things that really need immediate emphasis and action until we get fixed,\" Minicucci said.",
      "Runway construction at Newark airport",
      "Beginning April 15, Newark airport said it fully closed one of its three runways for rehabilitation work as part of a $121 million project.",
      "\"This work is designed to maintain the runway in a state of good repair, improve its infrastructure, meet the latest FAA standards, and ensure its continued safe operation,\" the airport said on its website.",
      "Runway 4L-22R is the busiest at Newark for departing flights, according to the airport, and the FAA is redirecting flight traffic to the airport's other runways, contributing to more congestion.",
      "The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees Newark airport as well as New York City's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airport, said that the first three months of 2025 were the second busiest in agency's history in terms of passenger volumes.",
      "The 11,000-foot-long, 150-foot-wide runway was last rehabilitated in 2014, according to the airport. The current project will include a new paved surface and upgraded lighting and signage, and the construction is expected to last until mid-June, Newark airport said.",
      "The FAA partially blamed the runway construction for the delays, but the construction project has been long running and airlines have factored that in. It was expected to cause delays, according to the airport, but not a meltdown.",
      "Fallout from the delays",
      "Due to the equipment issues and staffing problems, United Airlines canceled 35 flights per day from its Newark schedule starting the first weekend of May. United CEO Scott Kirby said in a letter that the \"long-simmering FAA challenges\" had \"boiled over.\"",
      "\"In the past few days, on more than one occasion, technology that FAA air traffic controllers rely on to manage the airplanes coming in and out of Newark airport failed \u2014 resulting in dozens of diverted flights, hundreds of delayed and canceled flights and worst of all, thousands of customers with disrupted travel plans,\" he wrote.",

      "\"To say that there is just minor turbulence at Newark Airport and the FAA would be the understatement of the year. We're here because the FAA is really a mess.

    "story": [
      "Shipments of Chinese goods to the U.S. are plunging, auguring potential supply chain disruptions that could empty store shelves as early as this summer, some experts have warned.",
      "As U.S. tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports take hold, supplies of a broad range of products could start to dwindle later this summer as back-to-school and holiday spending heats up. Experts warn that the sharp decline in trade activity could lead to COVID-19 pandemic-like shortages of products, including goods assembled in the U.S. or elsewhere that use materials or inputs from China.",
      "Many American retailers rushed to bring inventory into the country ahead of President Trump's sweeping levies, leading to a spike in imports since last summer. Imports have since slowed at a sharp clip, with a number of retailers foregoing orders on apparel, baby goods and more, that would typically be headed toward U.S. ports.",
      "\"Once this pull-forward effect fades, U.S. companies could face inventory shortfalls and restocking challenges, especially for back-to-school and holiday goods,\" TD Cowen analysts wrote in a research note on tariffs. \"Companies and products with high exposure to China and its manufacturing are most at risk of shortages,\" they added.",
      "The types of goods whose supplies were pulled forward include computers, passenger vehicles, cell phones and electric storage batteries, according to a TD Cowen analysis citing data from the Port of Los Angeles, which along with the\u00a0Port of Long Beach\u00a0receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia.",
      "Following the pre-tariff spike in imports, container bookings from China to the U.S. have gone down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company.\u00a0 So-called \"blank sailings,\" or canceled voyages to the Port of Los Angeles rose to 17 in May, from just six in the month of April, TD Cowen found.",
      "What does the U.S. import from China?",
      "The top categories of goods that U.S.-based sellers import from China, and which are most at risk of becoming scarce because of the trade war, are varied. They range from kids toys and sports equipment to apparel and bedding.",
      "\"Among them, toys stand out as particularly vulnerable, raising concerns about potential shortages during the critical holiday season,\" TD Cowen analysts noted.",
      "Here are some products from China that could soon be hard to come by in the U.S. as a result of tariffs, according to TD Cowen's analysis.",
      "Down feathers: The U.S. imports $1.9 billion in down feathers from China. That amounts to 77% of the country's total imported supply of down. Down is commonly used for insulation in comforters and outerwear.",
      "Toys, games and sports equipment: More than $30 billion in toys, games and sports equipment sold in the U.S. is imported from China. That accounts for just over 73% of the country's total imports in the category. The trade war could spell shortages in children's toys come Christmastime, experts, as well as President Trump, have warned.",
      "Textile art: The U.S. imports $8.6 billion in textile art from China. That accounts for over half of all the textile art the country imports from abroad.",
      "Footwear: The U.S. is highly reliant on China for shoes. It imports $9.8 billion's worth, or 36% of footwear sold stateside. Sportswear giant Adidas for one, has warned that it expects to raise prices for U.S. customers because of tariffs.",
      "Cutlery:\u00a0Dinner utensils manufactured in China could also start becoming scarce. The U.S. imports $3.1 billion in cutlery and metal tools from the country.",
      "Glassware: Almost 30% of U.S. imports of glassware and other products made of glass comes from China.",
      "Furniture and bedding: $18.5 billion's worth of furniture and bedding comes from China. That's 28% of all U.S. imports in the category.",
      "Apparel: $17.3 billion's worth of apparel is imported from China. That includes knit or crocheted clothing (almost $10 billion) and not-knit apparel ($7.3 billion).",
      "Beyond higher costs on consumer goods, businesses in a range of industries will face other tariff-related challenges. For example, the U.S. imports $124 billion in electric machinery; $82 billion in nuclear reactors, boilers and other machinery; $12 billion in goods made of iron or steel; and $19.3 billion in plastics from China each year, according to data from the International Trade Administration.",

      "Newark Airport is facing a ninth of delays and cancellations, as an air traffic controller shortage continues and rain adds to the issues. By 7 a.m. Tuesday, there were at least 56 delays and nearly 100 cancellations, after hundreds of flights were impacted Monday.",
      "The union representing air traffic controllers says multiple members are on trauma leave after an equipment failure caused them to lose communication with pilots last week.",
      "U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is expected to announce the details of a plan to overhaul the nation's aging air traffic control system on Thursday.",
      "\"We are going to radically transform the way air traffic control looks. We're going to build a brand new air traffic control system -- from new telecoms, to new radars, to new infrastructure. We're bringing on new air traffic controllers,\" Duffy said in an interview Monday night. \"This has been a problem in the decades coming, and we're going to fix it.\"",
      "In the meantime, the Federal Aviation Administration   is slowing the rate of arrivals to Newark to ensure safety while the staffing and equipment issues continue.",
      "Why is Newark Airport having delays?",
      "Questions remain about why there has been a shortage of air traffic controllers at the Philadelphia center that oversees airspace in Newark, New Jersey.",
      "The union said Monday that an equipment issue caused controllers to temporarily lose radar and communication with planes last week. At one point, controllers were unable to see, hear or talk with pilots for around 90 seconds, the union said.",
      "Duffy, however, said the outage lasted only 30 seconds.",
      "About half a dozen controllers requested trauma leave following the incident, allowing them to essentially be off the job for up to 45 days.",
      "\"The controllers did not 'walk off the job' as it has been reported by the media,\" the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a statement. \"Due to the event, the controllers took absence under the Federal Employees Compensation Act.

      "FAA responds to Newark airport delays",
      "The FAA also issued a statement on the matter, saying the antiquated system is\u00a0taking a toll on the workforce.",
      "\"Frequent equipment and telecommunications outages can be stressful for controllers. Some controllers at the Philadelphia TRACON who work Newark arrivals and departures have taken time off to recover from the stress of multiple recent outages,\" the statement read. \"While we cannot quickly replace them due to this highly specialized profession, we continue to train controllers who will eventually be assigned to this busy airspace.\"",
      "Both the union and the FAA said they support efforts to modernize the system.",
      "\"We must get the best safety technology in the hands of controllers as soon as possible,\" the FAA wrote. \"We are working to ensure the current telecommunications equipment is more reliable in the New York area by establishing a more resilient and redundant configuration with the local exchange carriers.\"",
      "The staffing issues are expected to last for at least a few more days. Experts say Newark's airspace requires special certification, so you can't simply reassign controllers from other locations.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial in New York City this month. Jury selection began Monday, and opening statements are scheduled to follow on May 12.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs will be tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"Freak Offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"Freak Off.\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That's the way it's supposed to be.\"",

      "He called Alcatraz \"a bad symbol, but it's a symbol of law and order.\"",
      "Why was Alcatraz closed?",
      "Alcatraz prison, located on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, just over a mile north of the city, was a maximum-security, minimum-privilege prison opened in 1934 to deal with the \"most incorrigible inmates in federal prisons,\" the Bureau of Prisons says. Before that, dating back to the 1850s, the site was used by the U.S. Army as a defensive citadel and to hold military prisoners.",
      "The prison was designed to \"show the law-abiding public that the Federal Government was serious about stopping the rampant crime of the 1920s and 1930s,\" the bureau says on its website.",
      "Well-known criminals such as Al Capone, George \"Machine-Gun\" Kelly, Alvin Karpis (the first \"Public Enemy No. 1\") and Arthur \"Doc\" Barker did time in Alcatraz, according to the BOP. However, most of the prisoners were not infamous gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules and regulations of other federal institutions.",

      "Over the 29 years that it operated as a prison, 36 men were involved in 14 separate escape attempts. Of these, 23 were caught, six were shot and killed, and two drowned.",
      "It closed on March 21, 1963, because the prison was too expensive to continue to operate, the BOP said. Because of its location on an island, all of its supplies \u2014 food, fuel, even fresh water \u2014 had to be brought in by boat. It was also expensive to maintain, with salt water surrounding it causing deterioration of the buildings.",
      "The government determined at the time that it cost three times more per prisoner to operate Alcatraz than any other federal prison, and that would be more economical to shut it down and build a whole new facility, the bureau said.",

      "After its closure, the prison was often portrayed as \"America's Devil's Island\" in books and movies, including \"The Rock\" starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage and the 1979 film \"Escape from Alcatraz\" starring Clint Eastwood.",
      "In 1972, Congress created the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the island where Alcatraz sits on was included as part of a new National Park Service site. The island opened to tourists in the fall of 1973 and has become one of the most popular National Park Service sites.",
      "Alcatraz Island continues to operate as a tourist site to this day, with more than a million tourists visiting the site each year \u2013 generating $60 million for the National Park Service and its partners. Taking it away as a tourist site would hurt the city, said former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.",

    "summary": "President Trump wants the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Here's what experts predict at the central bank's May 7 meeting.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has been pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, writing on social media last month that the central bank has been \"TOO LATE AND WRONG\" in holding off on further reductions. Now, the Fed is set to meet on Wednesday to make its next rate decision \u2014 but Mr. Trump may need to wait longer to get his cuts.",
      "The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its May 7 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch. The group pegs the likelihood at 99% that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the same level that it's been at since December, when the central bank made its most recent reduction.",
      "The Fed's meeting comes at a time when the U.S. economy is sending mixed signals, with GDP unexpectedly falling into negative territory in the first quarter, while job growth topped forecasts in April. At the same time, Wall Street economists are hiking their recession risk\u00a0for the U.S. economy due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have hit imports from China with a 145% import duty \u2014 costs that are largely passed onto American consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "The Fed has signaled it will take a wait-and-see approach, with Powell saying at a speech last month that the central bank can stay patient while tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out.",
      "\"The Fed and investors find themselves in a no man's land waiting to see whether economic policies drive prices higher and growth lower,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, in an email.",
      "He added, \"The reality is that corporate earnings have been pretty strong, the U.S. economy barreling along and the biggest cause for concern is sentiment. There isn't a good reason to change rates at this point, and the Fed is likely to reiterate the need for more data with three rate cuts priced in for 2025, at this point starting in the summer.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting.",
      "What date is the Fed's next meeting?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-member group that sets rate decisions, will meet on May 6-7, with the Fed announcing the FOMC's decision on May 7.",
      "What time is the Fed rate announcement?",
      "The Fed will announce the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on May 7, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to discuss the committee's decision at a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EST that day.",
      "What are the odds of a Fed rate cut?",
      "Very slim, with economists projecting t99% odds that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"Criticism from President Trump will not trigger a Fed policy response \u2014 neither an early cut without evidence of labor market deterioration, nor a stubborn refusal to cut once the labor market does soften, provided long-term inflation expectations remain anchored,\" noted Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius in a May 6 research note.",
      "When is the Fed expected to cut rates?",
      "Consumers eager for relief on borrowing costs are likely going to face a wait, according to economists.",
      "Following the May 7 meeting, the Fed will next meet on June 18, with economists currently expecting the central bank to also hold steady then, according to CME FedWatch. Its polling finds a 70% likelihood that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.5% at that meeting.",
      "However, it's more likely the Fed could slash rates at its July 30 meeting, with the probability of a rate cut sitting currently at 80%, FedWatch notes.",
      "But some economists expect the central bank to hold off even longer.",
      "\"We think the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates next year, as tariff-induced inflation begins to fade and the labor market shows more troubling signs,\" noted Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan Sweet, who says he believes the first cut will occur in December.",
      "Why does Trump want a rate cut now?",
      "Mr. Trump argues that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that there is \"NO INFLATION\" and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon.",
      "But those claims are not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined \u2014 gas costs are down 10% from a year ago \u2014 continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "Borrowers who are looking for relief on loan and credit card rates will have a wait ahead of them, experts say.",
      "\"There's just so much uncertainty in the economy now,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in an email. \"No one quite knows what the next few months will look like, but what does seem clear is that Americans are going to have wait at least a little longer for the Fed to cut rates.\"",
      "Schulz predicts that credit card rates could tick higher in the next few months, as well as auto loan rates.",
      "\"Banks are nervous about all of the uncertainty in the economy and what it means for consumers,\" he noted. \"When that happens, banks try to minimize risk as much as possible, and one of the ways they do that is to raise interest rates on credit cards.\"",
      "Because of that, consumers should focus on shopping around for the best rates they can find, as well as considering transferring existing high-interest credit card debt to 0% balance transfer cards, Schulz added.",

      "Louisiana authorities on Monday charged a second suspect with murder in the death of a television reporter who had traveled to New Orleans to cover the Super Bowl.",
      "Adan Manzano, a 27-year-old reporter and anchor for Telemundo based in Kansas City, Missouri, was found dead Feb. 5 in his hotel room in the New Orleans suburb of Kenner. A woman seen on security video leaving Manzano's room was later charged with second-degree murder and with stealing his credit cards and cellphone.",
      "Kenner police announced Monday that an accomplice, 34-year-old Rickey White, has also been charged with second-degree murder. White was arrested in Florida in March on robbery and fraud charges related to Manzano's death, then extradited to Louisiana.",
      "Kenner police said in a news release that the murder charge against White resulted from \"continued investigative efforts,\" but officials gave no further details.",
      "\"Investigators have worked tirelessly to uncover the details surrounding the events that led to Mr. Manzano's tragic death,\" Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said in a statement, the New Orleans CBS affiliate\u00a0WWL-TV reported.",
      "Conley had said at a news conference March 18 that investigators had linked White to Danette Colbert, 49, the first suspect charged in the case, based on \"correspondence and information where they were going back and forth. So we think they were working hand-in-hand in concert with each other.\"",
      "An attorney for White, Kevin Boshea, said he hadn't been informed of the murder charge before an Associated Press reporter called him Monday.",
      "\"I don't think he's guilty of the other crimes,\" Boshea said, \"so how can he be guilty of murder?\"",
      "Boshea said he pressed police during a preliminary hearing on the robbery and fraud charges last month to show evidence that White was in the New Orleans area when Manzano died, but they presented none.",
      "An attorney for Colbert had said that police were making \"assumptions and guesses\" to link her to Manzano's death.",
      "Under Louisiana law, a defendant can be charged with second-degree murder for distributing drugs that cause a death or for committing certain crimes, including robbery, that result in someone dying.",
      "An autopsy found Manzano died lying facedown on a pillow and unable to breathe after ingesting a combination of alcohol and the depressant Xanax, Jefferson Parish Coroner Gerry Cvitanovich told reporters in March.",
      "Police said security video from Manzano's hotel showed him and Colbert entering his room together the day of his death. Footage showed Colbert leaving without him about an hour later. Authorities have said Colbert later used Manzano's credit card to make a purchase at a New Orleans gas station and at several stores in the area.",
      "Police have also said Manzano's medical records showed no prescriptions for Xanax or other depressants, and that they recovered the drug from Colbert's home. She was found guilty of theft and fraud charges in an unrelated case last year, and, in 2022, was arrested twice in Las Vegas on felony charges for grad larceny and administering a drug to aid in a felony crime according to court records.",
      "In the Las Vegas cases, Colbert was accused of drugging men in their hotel rooms and stealing from them. However, the charges were ultimately dismissed because the victims did not want to testify in court, Colbert's attorney in those cases, Daniel Lippmann, told The Associated Press earlier this year.",
      "Detectives believe Colbert and Manzano met during a night out, and, later, she later allegedly gave him a drug in his hotel room to incapacitate him before stealing his phone and credit card, WWL-TV reported. Authorities have accused White of helping to facilitate the thefts, including by providing transportation, the station reported.",
      "They also say White and Colbert communicated multiple times on the day Manzano died, with some of their text messages containing discussions about obtaining victims' PIN numbers and using \"knock outs\" to incapacitate them, WWL-TV reported, citing court records.",
      "Kenner Police are coordinating with the Louisiana State Police, the state Attorney General's Office and the Jefferson Parish District Attorney's Office as they continue to investigate Manzano's death.",

      "This year's co-chairs were Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams and, of course,\u00a0Vogue\u00a0editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. LeBron James was an honorary chair, but was unable to attend due to a knee injury. There was also a host committee made up of 25 other stars.",
      "What was the Met Gala theme this year?",
      "The 2025 theme explored Black style and the history of dandyism.",
      "\"We're going to see lots of suits, I think in all shapes, sizes, colors,\" says Complex\u00a0editor-in-chief Aria Hughes. \"I think designers are going to play in different ways, and then hopefully lay in some storytelling. I hope to see some archival pieces from Black designers, like a Patrick Kelly or a Willi Smith. So I'm really hoping that people have fun with it.\"",
      "Hughes said the stars to watch included Andr\u00e9 3000 and Slick Rick, whose Bronx roots helped influence style in hip-hop.",
      "\"I really want to see Andr\u00e9 3000. I think that he's been someone who has used dress in such a powerful way. Sometimes it's incredibly rebellious and fun, sometimes it's very conservative,\" she said. \"I also think it's important to have a southern lens, he's from Atlanta. So I think him bringing that to the red carpet will be incredibly important.\"",
      "She also expected to see Grace Wales Bonner's designs somewhere on red carpet.",
      "\"Her work has been about the study of Black male identity and then reflecting that through fashion in a very modern but historical way,\" she said. \"So I think she's a current day designer who really embodies Black dandyism.\"",
      "What exhibition is the 2025 Met Gala theme celebrating?",
      "The gala serves as an annual benefit for the museum's Costume Institute, dating back to 1948.",
      "The museum's CEO announced Monday this year's event had\u00a0already raised a record $31 million.",
      "The institute says this exhibition is the first in more than 20 years to focus exclusively on menswear.",
      "\"It's incredibly significant, because this is the first time in the Met's history that they are centering Black identity and Black designers. So that acknowledgement from that institution is huge,\" Hughes explained. \"And I think as we face a lot of Black history being erased, this is just kind of combatting that.\"",
      "\"So in many ways, Black designers are getting the same treatment as their white peers, whose work is preserved in museums. So they'll have this same chance,\" she continued. \"And I think just from a mass-level with the gala, now people are understanding the influence of Black identity on fashion.\"",
      "The exhibition was inspired by Guest Curator Monica L. Miller's book,\u00a0\"Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.\"",
      "\"Fashion and dress have been used in a contest of power and aesthetics for Black people from the time of enslavement to the present, and dandyism has long served as a vehicle through which one can manipulate the relationship between clothing, identity, and power,\" Miller wrote in a statement when it was announced in February. \"The history of Black dandyism illustrates how Black people have transformed from being enslaved and stylized as luxury items, acquired like any other signifier of wealth and status, to autonomous, self-fashioning individuals who are global trendsetters.\"",
      "\"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" opens May 10 and will be on view through October 26. Entrance is free with museum admission.",
      "What is Black dandyism?",
      "Dandyism was once used to describe aristocratic style, but the term later evolved with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Miller writes in her book that dandified Black servants in 18th century England were forced to wear gold, brass and silver collars with padlocks to signify their owners' wealth.",
      "Slaves arrived in America with few or no belongings, and treasured what they had left, Miller writes. Stripped of their identities, they often added their own flair to their tailored Sunday best looks for church or holidays.",
      "Post-Emancipation, Black Americans had a chance to reclaim their autonomy, paving the way for the Harlem Renaissance. From the 1920s to 1930s, the neighborhood became a hub for Black cultural expression.",
      "The renaissance was a time of living and dressing boldly for Black Americans. Women donned furs and beaded dresses, while men experimented with tailored fabrics, billowing silhouettes, fedora hats and two-toned oxfords.",
      "One prominent style to arise was the zoot suit -- defined by high-waisted draped pants and oversized jackets with large shoulders and lapels. The suits were subversive by taking up space and, because of fabric rations during World War II, owning one was an act of protest.",
      "So what makes someone a dandy today?",
      "\"It's really someone who is dedicated to dress, like they see dress as a discipline, in the same way viewing working out as a discipline or studying music as a discipline. So they view it as a discipline, and a lot of the times it shows up in tailored clothes, but... it's not only people who wear suits, it's become more casual and I think just more free and fluid,\" explained Hughes.",
      "Hughes also noted a recent\u00a0interview where Dapper Dan said there are two kinds of dandy -- \"the ascot dandy and the sweatsuit dandy.\"",
      "\"Ultimately, it's someone who wants to use clothes as armor in a way to impact the way in which people perceive them and fight stereotypes that are sometimes rooted in racism,\" she said.",
      "Dandyism isn't just for men. Janelle Mon\u00e1e, who sits on the Met Gala's host committee, is known for her dandy style, with tailored suits, ornate bowties and oversized hats.",
      "What were past Met Gala themes through the years?",
      "The 2024 Met Gala theme was \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\"\u00a0and the accompanying dress code was \"Garden of Time.\"",
      "Stars wore nature-inspired designs, including lots of nude looks from the likes of Emily Ratajkowski, Mona Patel, Rita Ora and Karol G. Tyla carried an hour glass clutch and wore a gown made of sand, and Doja Cat went for a wet look with dripping mascara and soaked white dress.",
      "In 2023, the gala honored the late designer\u00a0Karl Lagerfeld, with references to his unique style and combination of black, white and leather, as well as his\u00a0beloved cat Choupette.",
      "There was a two-part theme for 2021 and 2022: \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\" and \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\" The first part explored the country's evolving culture, and some of the night's designs incorporated masks in wake of the COVID pandemic. The second part celebrated American identity through fashion's eyes, with lots of \"Gilded Glamour.\"",
      "Before that, 2019 brought \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" and Zendaya's dazzling light-up Cinderella dress, and 2018's theme \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" saw Katy Perry in a giant set of angel wings from Versace.",

    "story": [
      "Phoenix \u2014 The key to apparently cracking a series of fatal shootings in the Phoenix area in 2017 came when police were called to a blood-spattered apartment where they arrested a man who was suspected of killing his mother and stepfather.",
      "Authorities say evidence found there linked Cleophus Cooksey Jr. to four other killings. Police found a gun used in several of them, a necklace belonging to a victim and the vehicle keys of a woman whose partially nude body was found in an alley.",
      "Cooksey's trial opened Monday, more than seven years later, after repeated delays due to the pandemic. The 43-year-old is accused of murder and other charges stemming from a total of eight killings in Phoenix and nearby Glendale over a three-week span. If he is convicted, prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty. Cooksey has said the allegations against him are false and pleaded not guilty.",
      "In opening statements to a jury of 22 \u201410 of whom are alternates \u2014 prosecutor Josh Maxwell said the victims had in common that they were all vulnerable at the time they were killed.",
      "\"The focus of this trial is one of those classic whodunits, and the evidence will show the person whodunit, if you will, is this individual over here, the defendant, Cleophus Emmanuel Cooksey,\" Maxwell said pointing to Cooksey.",
      "Defense attorney Robert Reinhardt began his opening statement telling jurors of their duty to be fair and impartial and said the prosecution did not point out a motive, calling the offenses \"random and unrelated.\"",
      "\"You didn't hear anything about premeditation either. The state made statements that in incident No. 1, Mr. Cooksey just went up and shot them, but there's no rhyme or reason to any of that,\" Reinhardt said.",
      "In earlier years, two other serial shooting cases sparked fear in metro Phoenix, prompting some people to stay indoors after dark or stay off freeways where they occurred. Unlike those cases, the killings Cooksey is accused of didn't occur over a matter of months and generated no publicity until his arrest.",
      "Cooksey's trial is expected to last more than eight months, said Vincent Funari, a Maricopa County Superior Court spokesperson.",
      "Killing spree begins",
      "The first of the eight killings happened Nov. 27, 2017. By that point, Cooksey had been out of prison for four months after serving time for his role in a 2001 strip club robbery that turned deadly.",
      "Cooksey knew some of the victims intimately, but others were strangers. Most of the shootings happened in the evening and overnight. Police never released their conclusions about a motive but said Cooksey was responsible.",
      "Parker Smith and Andrew Remillard were the first victims, shot while sitting inside a vehicle in a parking lot. Five days later, security guard Salim Richards was fatally shot on the way to his girlfriend's apartment. Prosecutors say Cooksey and Richards fought physically and Cooksey walked away with Richards' gun and necklace.",
      "Latorrie Beckford and Kristopher Cameron were killed in separate shootings at apartment complexes in Glendale.",
      "Maria Villanueva was expected at her boyfriend's apartment in Glendale, but police say Cooksey drove away with her in her vehicle. The next day her body, naked from the waist down, was found in a Phoenix alley. Authorities say she had been sexually assaulted and Cooksey's DNA was found on her body.",
      "Finally, on Dec. 17, 2017, Cooksey answered the door when officers acting on a report of gunshots showed up at his mother's apartment. Officers noticed a lot of blood. Cooksey said he had cut his hand and was the only one home, according to police. Cooksey's mother, Rene Cooksey, and stepfather, Edward Nunn, were found dead. Before he was detained, police say, Cooksey threatened to slit an officer's throat.",
      "On the sofa in the living room, investigators found Richards' gun, which was later linked to the killings of Beckford, Cameron and Villanueva. The keys to Villanueva's vehicle also were found there, and police say Cooksey was wearing Richards' necklace when he was arrested.",
      "In a January 2020 handwritten letter to a judge over the impending postponement of his trial, Cooksey said he was in an \"upmost hurry\" to prove \"my charges are no more than false accusations\" and \"what better way to do so than\" a not-guilty verdict. An aspiring musician, he said he was not a rapist or murderer: \"I am a music artist.\"",
      "Despite wanting to exercise his right to a speedy trial, Cooksey's case encountered postponements due to the pandemic, which interfered with preparation including the ability of experts to evaluate Cooksey.",
      "Earlier in the case, his lawyers raised questions about a claim police made around the time of his arrest that Cooksey was suspected of a ninth killing. But prosecutors ultimately declined to charge Cooksey in the December 2017 shooting death of Jesus Real at his home in Avondale.",
      "According to police, Real's sister and Cooksey had broken up the night before. Prosecutors said they had no reasonable likelihood of winning a conviction.",
      "Third in a series of serial shootings",
      "Cooksey's arrest came after two serial shooting cases in recent years.",
      "From late August to early September 2015, a total of 11 shootings occurred on freeways. No one was seriously hurt when eight vehicles were hit with bullets and three others with projectiles such as BBs or pellets. But a 13-year-old was cut by glass.",
      "Charges were later dismissed against the only person charged in the shootings, who went on to win a rare court order declaring him officially cleared of the allegations.",
      "The next serial shooting case came over nearly a one-year period that ended in July 2016. Aaron Juan Saucedo, a bus driver, has been charged with first-degree murder and other charges in the attacks, which killed nine people. He was arrested in April 2017.",
      "Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Saucedo, who has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled for December.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 16:36:13 -0400",
    "summary": "The Social Security Administration said it will now seek to recoup less money from beneficiaries. Advocates say the revised policy is still burdensome.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration is retreating from a recent policy change on the agency recovering overpayments that sparked concerns it could cause financial hardship for tens of thousands of beneficiaries.",
      "In an April 25 \"emergency message\" to Social Security employees, the agency said it is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%. The change comes after SSA on March 27 started recovering erroneous overpayments to Social Security recipients by\u00a0taking 100%\u00a0of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up sharply from the prior rate of 10%.",
      "The agency didn't explain its reason for the change, nor immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The 100% clawback policy was directed by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to\u00a0cut costs\u00a0at the agency. Dudek said in a March 7 press release that the change was needed to \"properly safeguard taxpayer funds.\"",
      "The agency's move to recover overpayments has long been a pain point for thousands of beneficiaries who are overpaid each year, with many people unaware they had received a bigger benefit than they were entitled to until receiving notices from the Social Security Administration.",
      "The agency's inspector general found that 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations, rather than the fault of the beneficiary.",
      "\"SSA's automated systems could not compute benefit payments due in certain situations, and the Agency did not provide employees with a comprehensive tool to use when they had to manually calculate them. Without adequate automation tools, employees can make errors,\" the inspector general said in a report.",
      "Severe clawbacks cause hardship",
      "Last year, the Biden administration\u00a0capped the clawback rate\u00a0at 10% after reports that some seniors and disabled beneficiaries had been forced into financial hardship, including homelessness, due to the prior 100% clawback rate. But that 10% rate was only effective for about a year, with the the agency returning it to a 100% rate in March.",
      "Those most at risk from the government's stepped-up effort to recover overpayments are the roughly one-third of Social Security recipients who rely on their monthly benefit check for at least 75% of their income. Some seniors have told CBS News they were left\u00a0too financially strapped\u00a0to afford rent, food and other basics.",
      "Many of the overpayments involve disabled workers who receive payments through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, whose recipients receive an average of $1,538 per month, said Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.",
      "One SSA\u00a0report found that SSDI has a higher rate of overpayments than the overall Social Security program because disabled recipients sometimes fail to report work income, which can occur if they're not aware they need to disclose extra earnings to the agency. Social Security\u00a0reduces benefits for disabled recipients who earn more than $1,620 a month.",
      "\"While walking back the clawback of overpayments from 100% to 50% is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities who receive SSDI,\" Adcock told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"A fifth of all SSDI beneficiaries rely on their benefits for almost all of their income. That means some SSDI recipients are still going to have trouble paying for rent, food, utilities and prescriptions\" with the 50% clawback rate.",
      "The Social Security Administration docked the the benefits of about 670,000 recipients by 10% for overpayment last year, according to KFF.",

      "The Real ID deadline is rapidly approaching. Americans will be required to switch to the enhanced form of identification by Wednesday, May 7, if they want to travel by plane domestically.",
      "If you still need to update your ID you're not alone: CBS data shows that dozens of states are behind on compliance.",
      "An analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that 30 states are less than 70% compliant. Out of all states, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation at 17%.",
      "Here's what you need to know to make sure you're ready for the May 7 Real ID deadline.",
      "What is a Real ID?",
      "The Real ID is a federally compliant license, learner permit or nondriver ID card issued by state driver's license agencies. You can tell if a state-issued license or ID card is a Real ID if it has a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "The symbol might look slightly different depending on the state from where it's issued: California, for example, puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Who needs a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are required for those over 18 who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification, unless they want to bring a valid U.S. passport.",
      "When will I need to use a Real ID?",
      "Americans will need to show Real IDs to access certain federal facilities \u2014 including TSA checkpoints \u2014 enter nuclear power plants and board commercial aircraft, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).",
      "Am I required to get a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are only required for those over 18 without a valid U.S. passport who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification.",
      "That's said, Real IDs are considered a more secure form of identification than a classic driver's license.",
      "The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the Federal Government \"set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, although some states started issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009.",
      "You can find more details on Real ID on the DHS' website.",
      "Can I use an Enhanced ID instead of a Real ID?",
      "Five states \u2014 Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Vermont \u2014 issue what is called an\u00a0Enhanced Driver's License\u00a0(EDL), or Enhanced ID. This is considered an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card.",
      "Whereas Real IDs have a star emblem, Enhanced IDs have an image of the U.S. flag in the top right corner or the word \"Enhanced\" at the top of the card.",
      "Both Real IDs and Enhanced IDs are federal documents that allow holders to fly domestically.",
      "Enhanced IDs also allow you to travel from the U.S. to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, without a passport \u2014 something you can't do with a regular Real ID.",
      "How much does a Real ID cost?",
      "Prices vary by state. In\u00a0New York, for example, there is no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the normal transactional cost you pay for a standard license, ID or renewal. Pennsylvania, however, charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees. New York charges an additional $30 fee for Enhanced IDs.",
      "It's best to check your state's Real ID guidelines for an accurate estimate of how much you'll pay. The same goes for Enhanced IDs.",
      "How do I get a Real ID? Can I apply for one online?",
      "Each state has a driver's licensing agency that issues Real IDs. To find out how to apply where you live, visit the DHS website and click on your state of residence for specific instructions. DHS recommends that you visit your state's driver's licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation you'll need to brings in order to obtain a Real ID.",
      "Be sure to plan ahead as some states have longer wait times for DMV appointments.",
      "What if I plan to travel next week but I don't have a Real ID yet?",
      "A TSA spokesperson told CBS News Philadelphia that if travelers show up to the airport next Wednesday without a Real ID they may still be able to fly, but getting on board the plane may take longer than usual. The transportation agency recommends that people without a Real ID arrive at the airport three hours early to ensure enough time to get through security.",
      "TSA said it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints, meaning approximately four out of every five travelers are showing up with a Real ID-compliant driver's license or another valid form of identification.",
      "\"We don't have concerns at this point about this deadline really impacting operations, especially for those people who again are prepared and have everything they're supposed to have,\" Jessica Mayle, a public affairs specialist at TSA, told CBS Philadelphia.",
      "Are there alternative forms of identification I can use at the airport?",
      "If you don't have a Real ID, TSA has a list of other valid forms of identification you can use to get through an airport checkpoint. This includes passports, permanent resident cards, Enhanced IDs and Global Entry cards.",

      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn.

      "Israel's far-right Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich said Tuesday that a victory for Israel in Gaza would mean the Palestinian territory being \"entirely destroyed\" before its inhabitants depart for other countries.",
      "\"Gaza will be entirely destroyed, civilians will be sent to... the south to a humanitarian zone without Hamas or terrorism, and from there they will start to leave in great numbers to third countries,\" the firebrand top official said at a conference on Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "Israel's plan to seize control of the Gaza Strip has sparked renewed fears, but for many of the territory's residents, the most immediate existential threat remains the specter of famine amid a months-long Israeli blockade on all goods entering the enclave, which is home to more than 2 million people.",
      "The plan to expand military operations, approved by Israel's security cabinet late Sunday night, includes holding territories in the besieged Gaza Strip and moving the population south \"for their protection,\" according to Israeli officials.",
      "But Gaza residents told the AFP news agency that they did not expect the new offensive would make any significant changes to the already dire humanitarian situation in the small coastal territory.",
      "\"Israel has not stopped the war, the killing, the bombing, the destruction, the siege, and the starvation \u2014 every day \u2014 so how can they talk about expanding military operations?\" Awni Awad, 39, told AFP.",
      "Awad, who lives in a tent in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis after being displaced by Israeli evacuation orders, said that his situation was already \"catastrophic and tragic.\"",
      "\"I call on the world to witness the famine that grows and spreads every day,\" he said.",
      "The U.N.'s World Food Program in late April said it had depleted all its foods stocks in Gaza due to Israel's blockade on all supplies since March 2.",
      "Aya al-Skafy, a resident of Gaza City, told AFP her baby died because of malnutrition and medicine shortages last week.",
      "\"She was four months old and weighed 2.8 kilograms (6.2 pounds), which is very little. Medicine was not available,\" she said. \"Due to severe malnutrition, she suffered from blood acidity, liver and kidney failure, and many other complications. Her hair and nails also fell out due to malnutrition.\"",
      "Umm Hashem al-Saqqa, another Gaza City resident, fears her 5-year-old son might face a similar fate, but is powerless to do anything about it.",
      "\"Hashem suffers from iron deficiency anemia. He is constantly pale and lacks balance, and is unable to walk due to malnutrition,\" she told AFP. \"There is no food, no medicine, and no nutritional supplements. The markets are empty of food, and the government clinics and pharmacies have nothing.\"",
      "Israeli officials have denied a hunger crisis in Gaza,",
      "Gaza City resident Mohammed al-Shawa, 65, said that Israel's new military roadmap changes little as it already controls most of Gaza.",
      "\"The Israeli announcement about expanding military operations in Gaza is just talk for the media, because the entire Gaza Strip is occupied, and there is no safe area in Gaza,\" he said.",
      "The U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairscb estimates that 69% of Gaza has now been either incorporated into one of Israel's buffer zones, or is subject to evacuation orders.",
      "That number rises to 100% in the southern governorate of Rafah, where over 230,000 people lived before the war but which has now been entirely declared a no-go zone.",
      "\"There is no food, no medicine, and the announcement of an aid distribution plan is just to distract the world and mislead global public opinion,\" Shawa said, referring to reports of a new Israeli plan for humanitarian aid delivery that has yet to be implemented.",
      "\"The reality is that Israel is killing Palestinians in Gaza by bombing, shooting, or through starvation and denial of medical treatment,\" he said.",
      "Israeli officials consistently blame Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the U.S. and the European Union, for all the suffering in Gaza, accusing it of stealing humanitarian aid for its own purposes, which the group denies.",
      "Israel's hardline Minister of Defense Israel Katz said in mid-April, about a month into the blockade, that the policy aimed at pressuring Hamas to capitulate and release the hostages would not change.",
      "\"Israel's policy is clear: no humanitarian aid will enter Gaza, and blocking this aid is one of the main pressure levers preventing Hamas from using it as a tool with the population,\" he said. \"No one is currently planning to allow any humanitarian aid into Gaza, and there are no preparations to enable such aid.\"",
      "That was followed on April 23 by a flat denial from the Israeli Foreign Ministry of any hunger crisis in Gaza whatsoever.",
      "\"Israel is monitoring the situation on the ground, and there is no shortage of aid in Gaza,\" ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein said in\u00a0a statement\u00a0posted on social media, rejecting accusations that Israel was using food as a weapon of collective punishment against Gaza's civilian population.",
      "\"According to Article 23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, a side is not obliged to allow in aid if it is 'likely to assist the military or economic efforts of the enemy,'\" Marmorstein said. \"Hamas hijacked the humanitarian aid to rebuild its terror machine.\"",

The punishment for leaking information about the ancient Catholic Church ritual is immediate excommunication.",

      "They have all arrived at the Vatican for the gathering, and they've been seen this week going in and out of meetings every day, where they discuss the merits of the men among their own ranks \u2014 any one of whom could be chosen as the next pope.",

      "Rubera, who has been in his same-sex relationship for years, told CBS News that \"when Pope Francis died, I cried.\"",
      "A decade ago, Rubera and his husband were struggling over whether they could raise their kids Catholic. Then he got a phone call.",
      "\"So I answered, and it was: 'Mr. Rubera, are you busy at the moment, because I see you are you are not answering my calls, and this is Pope Francis.'\"",
      "He recalled his surprise as the late pontiff asked if he could make time to talk. He did, and Francis encouraged the couple to behave like any other Catholic family. Rubera said he's worried that the next pope may not be as eager to welcome him and his family into the church.",
      "\"My personal fear is that our lives, our families, our rights, could be ... canceled,\" he said.",
      "Another big issue facing the next pope will be the role of women in the church. There has been fierce debate within the Catholic community for years about whether women should be allowed to become deacons, and eventually even priests. That door, even during the relatively progressive reign of Pope Francis, remained firmly closed.",
      "But Kate McElwee, executive director of the Women's Ordination Conference, told CBS News that, \"on this question, women are not going to wait much longer.\"",

      "When the new pope is chosen behind the closed doors of the conclave, he'll adopt his chosen papal name and then be taken to an antechamber in the Sistine Chapel to put on his papal white robes.",

      "Here's what you need to know about the process and how long it might take.",
      "When does the 2025 papal conclave start?",
      "The conclave\u00a0begins on Wednesday, May 7 \u2014 16 days after Pope Francis' death.",
      "It's one of the oldest methods of electing a head of state that's still in use today, and its basic protocols have barely changed for 800 years.",
      "In order to become a pope, a candidate need only be Catholic and male. However, for centuries, popes have only been chosen from among the Catholic cardinals, the church's most senior officials.",
      "The conclave takes place in the Sistine Chapel, behind sealed doors. Along with all Vatican staff involved in the process, the cardinal electors take an oath of secrecy, and the chapel is swept for listening devices.",
      "The 133 electors participating this time around can hold one round of voting in the afternoon of the first day of the conclave, which consists of two ballots. To be elected pope, a candidate must garner two-thirds of the votes plus one. If the first round isn't conclusive, voting continues into a second day.",
      "From the second day onward, there are two rounds of voting each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.",
      "If there is no two-thirds majority after three days of voting, the process is paused for a day to allow time for the cardinals to pray and discuss their options.",
      "How long have conclaves taken to choose new popes in the past?",
      "There is no time limit set for how long a conclave can take. The cardinal electors continue to vote until a two-third-plus-one majority is achieved.",
      "The shortest conclave on record was in 1503, when it took the cardinals only 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III as the new pontiff.",
      "The longest conclave on record took nearly three years.",
      "The election of a successor to Pope Clement IV in 1268 dragged on for so long \u2014 about 1,000 days \u2014 that locals in the town of Viterbo, where it was held, locked the cardinals in the room where they had gathered until they reached a decision.",
      "That is where the name still used for the process of selecting a new pope \u2014 \"conclave,\" which translates to \"under lock and key\" \u2014 came from.",
      "After that marathon conclave, Pope Gregory X was finally elected in September of 1271.",
      "How long is the 2025 papal conclave expected to last?",
      "There is no way to predict how long a conclave will take, but guidance can perhaps be taken from recent history.",
      "The last three popes have been elected in two or three days.",
      "In 2013, Pope Francis was elected after five ballots held over two days. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI was elected after four ballots. In 1978, Pope John Paul II was elected over two days after eight ballots.",
      "Why does the papal conclave use white smoke?",
      "After each round of voting, the paper ballots are burned. If a pope has not been elected, black smoke rises from the chimney above the chapel. If a pope has been elected, white smoke rises.",
      "Initially, only black smoke was part of the conclave tradition, rising from the chimney as a result of ballots being burned after an unsuccessful round of voting.",

    "story": [
      "Minnesota is built by immigrants who've enriched the state with diversity and innovation. One of those groups is the Hmong community.",
      "Minnesota is home to the largest Hmong population in the country, and it all started nearly 50 years ago when\u00a0the Vietnam War ended with the fall of Saigon.",
      "Months after the fall, Leng Wong fled his home of Laos months after serving as a military officer in the Lao Armed Forces during the Secret War, a clandestine operation where\u00a0the CIA recruited and trained thousands of Hmong men\u00a0to fight on behalf of the U.S.",
      "\"Flew missions into different parts of Laos, and I flew in American military operative, translate for them, talk to troops on the ground and relayed it to the American troops,\" Wong said. \"I was traveling with so they could relay it back to the base or the headquarter and call for support.\"",
      "Wong served for 10 years, until the bitter end was inevitable. He knew it was no longer safe for him to stay.",
      "\"They called us traitors, so they don't like us,\" he said. \"It was so chaotic that we really didn't have time to think much about it other than how to survive.\"",

      "\"Just the clothes on our back. There was really nothing that we could bring with us,\" he said.",

      "\"There was a lot of uncertainty, what I would be facing in a new land,\" Wong said.",
      "He arrived at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, in the bitter cold, on Feb. 7, 1976.",
      "\"I was having trouble catching my breath because it was so cold, and we're not used to that type of cold in our home country,\" he said.",
      "Frigid, and foreign, Wong was often met with a cold shoulder. He says his biggest barriers at first were language and culture.",
      "\"Initially, we were faced with some resentment from the community as well, thinking that we were here taking away services,\" he said.",
      "Even so, Wong still felt the need to help others just like him. He made it his aim to improve the lives of other Hmong people who would be following in his footsteps.",
      "\"I was able to communicate and translate for people, so I'd be busy day and night,\" he said. \"We'd be at the hospital, the clinic, at the airport.\"",
      "Wong would spend years working for refugee programs with Lutheran Social Services and the state, helping people find jobs and working with employers to create those jobs.",
      "He'd also advocate for policy changes in support of refugees, all while traveling across Minnesota, and eventually across the country, to break down barriers and to educate others on the Hmong people.",
      "These days, Wong owns several commercial buildings across the Twin Cities, and also has his sights set on building more affordable housing for all Minnesota families.",
      "\"I don't think I'll ever retire. I think I will continue to advocate for our community and to work and contribute back to our community, as well as the community at large,\" he said.",
      "Wong is a humble servant, forever thankful for the new land, and its people who accepted him.",
      "\"Minnesota's been good to me. It's always cold, but the people in Minnesota are warm hearts,\" he said. \"We know this is where we belong now, but we still have a part of our heart on the other side of the world that we know we belong there, too.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 12:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A Houthi missile struck Ben-Gurion airport Sunday for the first time since the war began, briefly closing it just as Israel voted to expand Gaza operations.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's government approved plans on Monday for its forces to capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the territory for an unspecified amount of time, two Israeli officials told The Associated Press. The plans appear set to vastly expand Israel's operations in the war-torn Palestinian territory, and they're likely to bring fierce international opposition.",
      "Israeli Cabinet ministers approved the plan in an early morning vote, just after the Israeli military chief said the army was calling up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers for an expanded assault on the strip.",
      "The news came hours after a Sunday\u00a0Houthi missile strike targeted Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport for the first time since the war began, briefly halting flights and lightly wounding four people. Israeli officials quickly vowed to respond.",
      "Israel's expansion plan, which the officials told the AP is meant to help achieve the country's war aims of defeating Hamas and freeing hostages still held in Gaza, would push hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into southern Gaza, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis in the enclave.",
      "In a video message posted Monday on social media, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not confirm the intention for Israel's military to seize control of the entire strip, but he said the operation would be \"intensive.\"",
      "The European Union was among the first international entities to voice concern over the prospect of expanded Israeli military operations in Gaza, with spokesman Anouar el-Anouni saying an escalation would \"result in further casualties and suffering for the Palestinian population,\" and urging Israeli forces \"to exercise the utmost restraint,\" according to the French news agency AFP.",
      "Since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in mid-March with a renewed Israeli assault, the Israel Defense Forces have unleashed fierce strikes on the territory that have killed hundreds. The IDF has captured swathes of territory and now controls roughly half of Gaza. Before the truce ended, Israel halted all humanitarian aid into Gaza, including food, fuel and water, setting off what is believed to the be the worst humanitarian crisis in nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The ban on aid has prompted widespread hunger and shortages have set off looting, according to aid agencies that work in the enclave.",
      "The Israeli officials said the plan included the \"capturing of the strip and the holding of territories.\"",
      "With the plan, the officials said Israel also wants to keep Hamas from distributing humanitarian aid in the enclave it's controlled for nearly two decades, which Israel says strengthens its rule over Gaza. Israeli officials have accused Hamas of keeping aid materials for itself, to bolsters its capabilities. The plan also includes more powerful strikes against Hamas targets, the officials said.",
      "They added that Israel was in touch with several countries about President Trump's plan for the U.S. to \"take over\" Gaza and relocate its population of about 2 million Palestinians. Israeli officials have said it will entail \"voluntary emigration,\" but the suggestion that so many civilians could be moved out of the territory has sparked condemnation from Israel's allies in Europe, and from its Arab neighbors, who Mr. Trump said would take in the relocated masses.",
      "In his video message on Monday, Netanyahu said Gaza's \"population will be moved, for its own protection,\" without offering details.",
      "Asked Monday about the Israeli plans, U.S. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said President Trump remained \"committed to securing the immediate release of hostages and an end to Hamas rule in Gaza,\" reiterating the White House's stance that \"Hamas bears sole responsibility for this conflict, and for the resumption of hostilities.\"",
      "One of the Israeli officials told the AP the plan would be implemented gradually. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing secret military plans.",
      "Israel has tried for weeks to ratchet up pressure on Hamas to show more flexibility in ceasefire negotiations. But international mediators trying to bring the sides toward a new deal have struggled to do so. Israel's measures \u2014 most notably the ongoing strikes and the complete blockade on aid and other materials entering Gaza \u2014 do not appear to have moved Hamas away from its negotiating positions. The group, long designated a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and the European Union, has demanded that Israel agree to a complete withdrawal from Gaza as part of any lasting ceasefire.",
      "The previous ceasefire was meant to lead the sides to negotiate an end to the war, but that goal has been a repeated sticking point in talks between Israel and Hamas. Israel says it won't agree to end the war until Hamas is defeated.",
      "Israel's announcement of an expansion of military operations angered families of the remaining Israeli hostages. The Hostage Families Forum, which supports the families, said Monday that the plan puts every hostage at risk and urged Israel's decision-makers to secure a deal that prioritizes the hostages, as many as 24 of whom Israeli officials believe are still alive.",
      "At a committee meeting of Israeli lawmakers on Monday, Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among the hostages still in Gaza, called on soldiers \"not to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons.\"",
      "The Israeli officials did not disclose details of how the plan seeks to prevent Hamas from involvement in aid distribution. One said the ministers had approved \"the option of aid distribution,\" without elaborating.",
      "According to an internal memo circulated among aid groups and seen by the AP, Israel has told the United Nations that it will use private security companies to control aid distribution inside Gaza. The U.N., in a statement Sunday, said it would not participate in the plan as it was presented, saying it violates its core principles.",
      "The memo, sent to aid organizations on Sunday, detailed notes from a meeting between the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid for Gaza, COGAT and the U.N.",
      "Under COGAT's envisioned plan, all aid would enter Gaza through the southern Kerem Shalom crossing, including approximately 60 trucks per day, although the convoys' contents were not made clear, nor were how many people would have access to the aid coming in. Previously, the U.N. and other aid providers have said hundreds of trucks per day are needed to bring food and other vital materials into Gaza.",
      "The memo said the aid would be distributed at logistics hubs run by private security companies, and that facial recognition would be used to identify Palestinians at the hubs and SMS alerts would be used to notify people in the area that they could come to collect aid.",
      "Aid workers say the plan to centralize aid, rather than delivering it to Palestinians where they are, will forcibly displace more people. The fighting has already displaced more than 90% of Gaza's population, often multiple times, and turned much of Gaza into an uninhabitable moonscape.",
      "The U.N. said the plan would leave large parts of the population, including the most vulnerable, without supplies. It said the plan \"appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2014 as part of a military strategy.\"",
      "In a statement on Monday, Hamas said it firmly rejected the Israeli plan to control aid distribution, calling it a plan \"to turn aid into a tool for political blackmail or subject it to Israel's conditions,\" which it said \"constitutes a violation of international law and an extension of the starvation policy.\"",
      "The memo says the U.S. government has voiced clear support for Israel's plan, but it's unclear who would provide funding for the private military companies or the aid. COGAT and the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Israeli officials have repeatedly denied a humanitarian crisis in Gaza and said there is sufficient food in the territory, blaming Hamas for failing to distribute it to civilians.",
      "Earlier this week, The Associated Press obtained dozens of documents about aid groups' concerns that the aid distribution hubs could end up permanently displacing Palestinians and forcing them to live in \"de facto internment conditions.\"",
      "Capturing and potentially occupying Gaza again for an indefinite period would not only further dash hopes for Palestinian statehood, it would embed Israel inside a population that is deeply hostile to it and raise questions about how Israel plans to govern the territory, especially at a time when it is considering how to implement President Trump's vision for Gaza.",
      "Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on southern Israel, during which 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken as hostages back into Gaza. The Israeli offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials in the Hamas-ruled territory, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians.",
      "Israel occupied Gaza during a war in 1967 but withdrew troops and settlers from the enclave in 2005. Two years later, Hamas took over and has controlled the territory since.",

      "It was after their tiny plane crashed into the Bolivian jungle earlier this week that their ordeal really began.",
      "After smashing into the ground, the aircraft flipped over into a lagoon infested with anacondas and alligators, plunging the pilot and four passengers \u2014 including a 6-year-old boy \u2014 into a harrowing 36 hours spent clinging to the plane's wreckage before being rescued Friday in the northeast of this Andean nation.",
      "The doctor who treated the five survivors told The Associated Press on Saturday all were conscious and in stable condition, with only the young boy's 37-year-old aunt still hospitalized for an infected gash to her head. The rest were discharged and recovering from dehydration, minor chemical burns, infected cuts, bruises and insect bites all over their bodies.",
      "Bolivia's civil defense vice ministry released dramatic video and images of the group being rescued on Friday.",
      "\"We couldn't believe it, that they weren't attacked and left for dead,\" Dr. Luis Soruco, director of the hospital where the survivors were delivered in Bolivia's tropical Beni province, said by phone after sending the pilot and two of the women home with a strong course of antibiotics.",
      "The pilot, 27-year-old Pablo Andr\u00e9s Velarde, emerged Friday to tell the story that has transfixed many Bolivians \u2014 a rare piece of uplifting news for a nation badly in need of it after years of a spiraling economic and political crisis.",
      "\"The mosquitoes wouldn't let us sleep,\" Velarde told reporters from his hospital cot in the provincial capital of Trinidad, where Dr. Soruco said he was in surprisingly good health and spirits. \"The alligators and snakes watched us all night, but they didn't come close.\"",
      "Shocked that the caimans, a species of the alligator family native to Central and South America, didn't lunge at them, Velarde speculated it was the stench of jet fuel spilling from the wreckage that had kept the predatory reptiles at bay, although there's no scientific proof that's an effective alligator repellent.",
      "Velarde said that the five of them survived by eating ground cassava flour that one of the women had brought as a snack. They had nothing to drink \u2014 the lagoon water was filled with gasoline.",
      "The small plane had set off Wednesday from the Bolivian village of Baures, bound for the bigger town of Trinidad farther south, where Patricia Coria Guary had a medical check-up scheduled for her 6-year-old nephew at the pediatric hospital, Dr. Soruco said. Two other women, neighbors from Baures ages 32 and 54, joined them.",
      "Such flights are a common form of transportation in this remote Amazonian region carved with rivers. Heavy rains wash away unpaved roads this time of year.",
      "But just 27 minutes \u2014 almost halfway \u2014 into the flight, the plane's lone engine cut out. Velarde said he reported their imminent crash over a portable radio to a colleague.",
      "He recalled in interviews with local media that he scanned the vast emerald green canopy below him and aimed for a clearing near a lagoon.",
      "\"There was no ranch or road along the route,\" he said. \"It was just swamp.\"",
      "Instead of skidding across the shore as planned, the plane smashed into the ground and flipped upside down \u2014 injuring everyone on board and leaving Coria Guary with an especially deep cut to her forehead \u2014 before splashing into the water.",
      "\"The landing was very rough,\" Velarde said.",
      "As the plane flooded, the five of them managed to clamber on top of the fuselage, where they stayed for two terrifying nights surrounded by caimans and anacondas and attacked by swarms of mosquitoes and other insects.",
      "They waved shirts and sheets to no avail and screamed each time they heard the thud of propellers or revving of a boat engine. On Friday, at the sound of approaching motorboats, \"we started shining our cell phone flashlights and shouting,\" Velarde said.",
      "A group of fishermen noticed, and helped them into their canoe. They called the authorities and delivered them to an army helicopter some hours later.",
      "\"We couldn't have handled it one more night,\" Velarde said.",

      "Pope Francis' death on April 21, the day after Easter Sunday, started off a series of traditions that will soon culminate in a vote for the next pope. His successor will be decided by the Catholic Church's cardinal electors, a group of 133 cardinals under the age of 80, who are set to\u00a0begin their conclave\u00a0on May 7 to hold a secretive election for the next pontiff.",
      "\"Every papal conclave comes down, in some sense, to a referendum on the papacy that has just ended,\" John Allen, a longtime observer of the Vatican and editor of the Catholic news site \"Crux,\" said. Several of the likely frontrunners would represent continuity with the direction set\u00a0by Pope Francis, he said, while others would signal \"a change in a slightly more traditional, conservative direction.\"",
      "No matter their leanings, Allen said, the cardinal electors will be looking for someone who can equal Pope Francis' stature on the world stage. \"They want, in part, someone who can have the same capacity to make it absolutely impossible for the wider world to ignore what the Catholic Church has to say.\"",
      "Over the last 600 years \u2014 since 1378 \u2014 cardinals have been chosen for the position, although eligibility technically extends to any male Roman Catholic who has been baptized.",

      "Cardinal Peter Erdo, archbishop of Budapest, Hungary",
      "Cardinal Peter Erdo, a 72-year-old canon lawyer, is the highest ranking Catholic leader in a country that is 80% Christian. He is known for his support of the pope's outreach to Orthodox Christians.",
      "Erdo is also on the conservative side of the European cultural divide. On migration, a key issue for Hungary, he has conveyed a balanced approach, recognizing the right to migrate but also the importance of ensuring political stability.",
      "Erdo is considered a traditionalist but is also respected by liberals, which could make him a unifying force within the church.",
      "Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, archbishop of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo",
      "Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, president of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar, grew global attention for leading African bishops in unanimous rejection of \"Fiducia Supplicans,\" a declaration the Vatican issued in 2023 that included guidelines on the blessings of people in same-sex relationships.",
      "At 65 years old, he is known as a supporter of orthodoxy and defends priestly celibacy and the church's moral teachings. He is also known as a promoter of social justice and a champion of the poor and voiceless, and is outspoken in his criticism of the Congolese government.",
      "If elected he would be the first African chosen to lead the Catholic Church in more than 1,500 years. The last African pontiff was Pope Gelasius, who died in 496 after leading the church for a little over three years.",
      "Cardinal Mario Grech, secretary general for the Synod of Bishops",
      "Cardinal Mario Grech, 68, is a canon lawyer who has major influence on how synods in the church are run. Supporters have praised him for leading the charge in implementing a more consultative and inclusive approach to church governance.",

      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin, 70, is second-in-command at the Vatican and a career diplomat who has consistently risen above any turbulence marking the pontificate.",
      "He is regarded as a moderate who, if elected, could repair rifts inside the church. He is also considered a progressive with a global vision.",
      "Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, Latin patriarch of Jerusalem",
      "Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, is a pastoral candidate who has spoken out amid the Israel-Hamas war and visited Gaza during the conflict.",
      "He is a proponent of social justice and sees himself as a servant of the people. He is similar to Francis in his concern for migrants, interfaith dialogue and his disdain for clericalism.",
      "Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines",
      "Cardinal Luis Tagle, 67, and pro-prefect for the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, is known as the \"Asian Francis\" for his missionary spirit as well as his emphasis on caring for the poor and welcoming of LGBTQ and divorced and remarried Catholics.",
      "He is the former archbishop of Manila, in the Philippines, which is one of the most Catholic countries on the continent of Asia, and studied in the U.S. for seven years. His election would signal a continuation of Francis' pontificate.",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, archbishop of Bologna, Italy",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, 69, is the president of the Italian bishops conference. He is known as a \"street priest\" and missionary and wants a church that listens to the faithful and is willing to modernize. Zuppi is inclusive of same-sex couples, as well as people of different religions.",
      "Francis chose Zuppi as his envoy to Russia and Ukraine, as well as to the West Bank and Beijing, to promote peace.",
      "Cardinal Anders Arborelius, archbishop of Stockholm",
      "Cardinal Anders Arborelius, 75, was raised Lutheran and converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. He is the first ever cardinal from Scandinavia.",
      "He is also a traditionalist on the church's teaching on sexual ethics and gender, and has a strong concern for the environment.",
      "Arborelius has been a proponent of immigration into Sweden, calling for dialogue and integration instead of restrictions.",
      "Cardinal Gerald Cyprien Lacroix of Quebec",
      "Cardinal G\u00e9rald Cyprien Lacroix, Metropolitan Archbishop of Quebec, Canada, is 67 years old. Earlier in his career he spent years as a missionary and seminary professor in Colombia.",
      "He temporarily stepped back from his duties amid sexual abuse allegations, which he denied, and returned to his duties last year after a church-led investigation found no evidence of misconduct.",
      "Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana",
      "Conservative-leaning Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana would, like Ambongo, be the Catholic Church's first contemporary African pope if selected.",
      "But the Ghanaian, who was the first man from his country to be made a cardinal, is considered a less hard-line conservative than his Congolese counterpart.",
      "The 76-year-old has opposed the criminalization of homosexual relationships in Africa, including in his home country.",
      "In 2012, he was criticized for fear-mongering about Islam in Europe during a Vatican conference, and he later apologized.",

      "Rome \u2014 It's been called \"holy smoke.\" And it's color coded.",
      "Black and white plumes puffed from canisters over the weekend as pyrotechnics expert Massimiliano De Sanctis tested the mechanism that will signal the fate of the Catholic Church, and who will be the next man to lead its 1.4 billion followers.",
      "If the smoke that emerges from the chimney at the Sistine Chapel is black, it will mean the 133 cardinal electors inside for the papal conclave will continue voting. When it is white, it means they have elected the heir to St. Peter \u2014 and more recently, to Pope Francis.",
      "''Until the election of Pope Benedict XVI, the smoke was carried out in the traditional way,\" explained De Sanctis, who owns the FD Group Fireworks company. \"Ballots were burned to make black smoke and ballots were burned together with wet straw to make white smoke. But the Vatican realized that the smoke was not particularly intense, so it had an electrical control unit designed that controlled the classic pyrotechnic smoke.''",
      "The nine-day mourning period for the late Pope Francis, who died at the age of 88 on April 21 after 12 years leading the Catholic Church, officially came to an end Monday. As that period, known by its Latin name Novemdiales, came to an end, dozens of cardinals, carpenters and pyrotechnics experts were already at work preparing for the conclave to elect Francis' successor.",
      "Vatican firefighters installed the chimney at the Sistine Chapel over the weekend, along with the small stove in which the cardinals will burn their crumpled up ballots after each vote. The voting continues, with one round on the first day of the conclave and then up to four daily until one proves conclusive, with a new pontiff being chosen by a majority of two-thirds plus one of the 133 electors.",
      "Different ideologies at play as cardinals mull next Catholic leader",
      "That secretive process begins Wednesday, with the first vote, but the cardinal electors have already begun descending on Vatican City from across the world. And with them, comes the intrigue of the political campaign-like process of selecting one of their own to lead the church forward.",
      "Some of the believed front-runners among the cardinals would be expected to align with the policies and philosophies of Pope Francis if they were to get the Catholic Church's top job, including newly-minted Swedish Cardinal Anders Arborelius. He told CBS News over the weekend about meeting with many of his fellow cardinals for the first time.",
      "\"I must say, I'm surprised that it's so peaceful and such a friendly atmosphere,\" he said. \"If you read the papers, you get the idea that there are two parties fighting for power.\"",
      "\"Of course there are different points of view,\" acknowledged Arborelius, who is attending his first conclave. \"It's natural.\"",
      "Much like Francis was, Arborelius is a strong supporter of immigrants' rights. He said migrants to Europe have helped to keep Catholicism alive and well on the continent, making them \"very important for the church.\"",
      "\"I know there are exceptions, but still, we live in a global time, and it's nearly impossible to stop migration. And we need it also, I mean, in healthcare, care for elderly people, taxi drivers,\" he said, adding that, \"of course, there has to be some kind of order, some kind of harmonious migration and integration\" to ensure immigrant populations can thrive.",
      "The Swedish cardinal also hopes Francis' successor will push to integrate women \u2014 to a limited degree \u2014 more into the church's operations.",
      "\"Some people are very eager to have female priests,\" acknowledged Arborelius. \"But we cannot have that. So, it's important to show and to help women to find the positions and the work that they can do in the church.\"",
      "Asked why he, like Francis, backed more roles for women, but not priesthood, the cardinal said that, \"according to our faith, Christ as a man is the icon of what it is to be a priest. Mary is the icon of what a woman can be in the church.\"",
      "\"Of course, nowadays it's not easy to explain that,\" he said, noting the example of the Lutheran Church in Sweden, which he said now has \"more female ministers than male.\"",
      "\"So that's one of our tasks \u2014 to show that women have a very important place in the church, but we have to show what they can do and how they can do it. And I think Pope Francis has started this. For instance, now they always say in the Vatican state they have a prime minister who is a sister, Sister Rafaela. And on many issues, for instance I'm also a member of the Council of Economy, we have six ... experts in economy, all women, who help us to clear up the mess of the economy in the Vatican. So, I think there are many important tasks where a woman could do very much in order to help the church in the society of today.\"",
      "Others among the senior prelates gathering at the Vatican, however, have been openly critical of Francis, including German Cardinal Gerhard Muller, who has been a staunch defender of traditional Catholic doctrine.",
      "\"Gay marriage is not possible, it's absolutely against the word of God,\" he told CBS News, adding that in his view, that impossibility extends to the practice of priests blessing same-sex unions \u2014 which Francis green-lighted in a landmark decision almost two years ago.",
      "\"We cannot have a blessing in the sense of justifying of a behavior or of a lifestyle which is against the reason God Himself gave,\" Muller told CBS News, adding that he believes the next pope must bring more clarity to interpreting Catholic doctrine, \"I think not only for me, but for all the Catholics in the world.\"",
      "It's possible that that diversity in viewpoints among the cardinal electors inside the Sistine Chapel could lead to a drawn-out conclave.",
      "In recent times, cardinals have decided on a new pope in just two to three days.",
      "The longest-ever conclave took place during the 13th century, in the nearby city of Viterbo.

      "Below is a look inside the conclave process, with a step-by-step breakdown of how the next pope will be chosen and anointed under Michelangelo's iconic fresco on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel.",
      "What is the papal conclave, exactly?",
      "The papal conclave is the closely guarded gathering of the cardinal electors \u2014 all serving cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 to elect the next pope.",
      "The exact number varies, but of the 135 cardinals eligible to serve as electors right now, the Vatican has confirmed that 133 of them will gather from around the world to choose the successor to Pope Francis. One, Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, has said he will not enter the conclave after being sentenced to 5-1/2 years in jail by a Vatican court in 2023 for embezzlement and fraud. He has denied all wrongdoing and remains free pending an appeal to the Vatican court, but said on April 29 that he would not take part in the conclave.",
      "Of all the current cardinal electors, a large majority \u2014 108 \u2014 were appointed by Pope Francis during his 12-year papacy. They come from 71 different countries, including 10 from the United States.",
      "When will the papal conclave begin?",
      "The Vatican has announced that the conclave will begin on Wednesday, May 7.",
      "Under church rules, it must start 15 to 20 days after a pope's death; Pope Francis died on April 21.",
      "Ahead of the conclave, on May 5, Vatican officials and employees who will help support the process, including other clergy, security personnel, drivers, cleaning crews, doctors and nurses, must take an oath of secrecy.",
      "How does the papal conclave work?",
      "How this assembly proceeds to choose the next pope is a process that dates back hundreds of years \u2014 an intricate, choreographed procession of rituals and ballots.",
      "On the first day of the papal conclave, the cardinal electors will shut themselves off from the outside world and begin the momentous task of choosing \u2014 likely from among their own ranks \u2014 the man who will become the 267th Bishop of Rome, better known as the pope.",
      "On Day One, the cardinals celebrate a morning Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. In the afternoon, they walk in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, which will have undergone a security sweep to check for any illicit recording devices before their arrival.",
      "For centuries, the cardinal electors were physically locked inside the Sistine Chapel until they elected a new pontiff, left to eat and sleep beneath Michelangelo's vivid Renaissance masterpiece. These days, they do leave to rest and share meals at Santa Marta House \u2014 a hotel-like residence inside Vatican City where Francis had his own personal apartment during his pontificate \u2014 for however many days it takes them to come to a decision.",
      "Once the cardinals have all filed into the chapel, its great bronze doors are dramatically closed and sealed, and the first day's voting begins.",
      "How does the voting for a new pope work?",
      "The cardinals will have already discussed the merits of each papal prospect during days of \"general congregations\" at the Vatican before the conclave, but now the voting begins. Choosing the new pope requires not just a majority, but a two-thirds plus-one vote among the cardinal electors for a candidate to win. Pope Benedict XVI, who led the church prior to Francis, raised the threshold and enshrined the two-thirds requirement into church law two days before he stepped down.",
      "Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy before they vote. If they disclose any information from within the conclave they will be excommunicated by the church.",
      "To vote, each cardinal writes their chosen candidate's name on a ballot, disguising his handwriting, then walks to an altar at the front of the chapel and deposits the paper onto a ceremonial plate. He then tips the ballot from the plate into a chalice-urn.",
      "As they are counted and the handwritten entries recorded by three cardinals at the altar, known as scrutineers, the ballots are deposited into another urn.",
      "A third urn, made of gilded bronze and silver and adorned with Christian imagery, is used to ferry ballots from any cardinals too ill to leave their sleeping quarters to the chapel for counting.",
      "After the first vote is held on the first afternoon, the cardinals' ballots are placed into one of two small ovens inside the Sistine Chapel and burned. A plume of smoke flows up a chimney and into the air over St. Peter's Square, watched for eagerly by the faithful, and the world's media.",
      "If that round of voting yields no winner, the smoke will be black \u2014 a sign to the world that the Holy See remains vacant.",
      "How long can a conclave last?",
      "The voting process will repeat itself the following day, with the cardinals holding two ballots in the morning and two in the afternoon. If the morning sessions are inconclusive, black smoke will be seen again around lunchtime \u2014 early morning on the U.S. East Coast.",
      "If there's still no winner following the afternoon votes, more black smoke will stream into the early evening Roman sky.",
      "If there's no two-thirds majority after three days, voting is paused for a day to allow time for prayer, discussion and a \"brief spiritual exhortation\" by the senior cardinal in the Order of Deacons.",
      "Then the voting process resumes. A conclave will last until enough of the cardinal electors agree on a choice for the next pope.",
      "How long has it taken to choose a new pope in the past?",
      "The longest conclave in history was the one that brought Pope Gregory X to the papacy in 1281. It lasted almost three years from the time the cardinals first began their voting.",
      "Recent conclaves, however, have lasted just days. Pope John Paul II needed eight ballots, over two days, to become the pontiff in 1978. His successor, Benedict XVI, was chosen on the fourth ballot, after two days, in 2005.",
      "Francis, in 2013, needed a mere five ballots, with the voting taking just 24 hours.",
      "What will happen once the conclave chooses the next pope?",
      "When enough cardinals agree on a candidate and the vote reaches the two-thirds-plus-one threshold, the chosen man is asked if he accepts the role. He will acknowledge by simply saying the word for \"I accept\" in Latin: \"Accepto.\"",
      "At that point, he becomes the new pope and will state his chosen pontifical name before the assembled cardinals. The most common papal name has been John, used 21 times. Others, including Simplicius, Hilarius and Zosimus, have only ever been used once. Pope Francis was also the first to choose his papal name.",
      "The ballots are then burned in the stove, but this time, a chemical additive is left out to create the much-anticipated plume of \"fumata bianca,\" white smoke.",
      "There has been confusion during some past conclaves over the color of the smoke rising over the chapel, so two conclaves ago, in 2005, a new tradition began. In addition to the white smoke, bells now chime, heralding the news that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "The new pope then immediately goes into a chamber adjoining the Sistine Chapel to be clad in the papal robes.",
      "As the faithful and the curious crowd into St. Peter's Square below, the cardinal deacon steps out onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to introduce the new pontiff with the famous phrase, \"Habemus papa\" \u2014 We have a pope.",

      "EXCLUSIVE:\u00a0As the Small Business Administration (SBA) kicked off \"Small Business Week\" on Monday, SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler spoke to Fox News Digital about the work she has done at the agency while pushing back on the Democratic Party\u2019s narrative about the state of the economy.",
      "\"What I see on the ground is American manufacturers, small businesses alike are grateful to President Trump for his fair trade policy, for having the strength and the backbone to stand up to adversaries and allies alike and demand that they stop treating Americans unfairly with these trade practices,\" Loeffler told Fox News Digital about the current state of the economy as President Donald Trump faces criticism from Democrats and media outlets for his tariff policies.",
      "\"I see really strong support and optimism as well for the future. So, while there is a period of change here as we get through these negotiations and with trading partners at the table, we will make sure that small businesses have a big seat at that table, and we are already seeing small businesses invest for the future because they see the opportunity for a made-in-America approach that will really transform the strength of this country not just economically but from a national security perspective.\"",
      "Loeffler, speaking to Fox News Digital at an event in Washington, D.C., kicking off \"Small Business Week,\" said the current media narrative on Trump\u2019s trade policies is \"completely counter\" to what she sees when she travels the country.",

      "\"They are fully behind President Trump's policies to lower our taxes, to have fair trade, President Trump has already brought down core inflation to four-year lows,\" Loeffler said. \"We've seen the jobs come back, almost a half million jobs created in President Trump's first hundred days, and we're seeing his regulatory reforms have rollbacks that have already made a huge difference saving small businesses hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions already. And that's what small businesses want.\"",
      "Loeffler pointed out that small businesses make up 99% of all businesses in the country and create two out of three of every new job, and touted that the SBA has seen an 80% increase in loans in Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office.",
      "\"Small businesses don't take out loans unless they have confidence that they're going to grow, and we've seen that small businesses are doing just that,\" Loeffler said.",

      "President Donald Trump speaks at the White House on Tuesday, April 22. (AP/Alex Brandon)",
      "Loeffler told Fox News Digital that during her tenure, the SBA has been \"refocused\" on its mission after four years of the Biden administration, and part of that mission has been to implement Trump\u2019s agenda on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and illegal immigration.",
      "The SBA recently eliminated its\u00a0Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility, while placing the office's employees on administrative leave, and paused grants across the agency that it believes interferes with Trump\u2019s executive orders combating DEI.",

      "Loeffler told Fox News Digital that she is particularly excited about what she sees in the manufacturing sector and what can be accomplished in that area if Trump is able to get his tax cut plan through Congress.",
      "\"Manufacturing loans are up 74% and so that Made in America engine is happening to the tune of about a hundred manufacturing loans per week and that's what President Trump's agenda has done,\" Loeffler said.",
      "\"It's attracted upwards of eight trillion dollars in investments in this country. Much of that will be deployed through small businesses, though it was contributed by large businesses. I've talked to many of those CEOs. They deploy it through contractors that come through small businesses. So I'm tremendously excited about the upside that we can see with regard to the tax policy being passed. Hopefully, we have permanent tax cuts that we can deliver to small businesses soon, because I know that the demand for investment by small businesses is there, and it's really spring-loaded once that tax bill passes.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Apple's AirPlay was designed to make life easier, letting users stream music, photos and videos from iPhones and MacBooks to TVs, speakers and other compatible devices with just a tap. But now, cybersecurity researchers have revealed that this same convenience may be opening the door to hackers. A new set of vulnerabilities, collectively called AirBorne, could turn AirPlay-enabled gadgets into stealthy entry points for malware and network infiltration.",
      "Join The FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":\u00a0Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free\u00a0\"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"\u00a0when you sign up.",
      "A person holding an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Researchers at Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Oligo\u00a0recently disclosed AirBorne, a group of security flaws in Apple's proprietary AirPlay protocol. These bugs exist primarily in the AirPlay software development kit (SDK) used by third-party manufacturers to bring AirPlay support to smart TVs, speakers and other media devices. The security flaws mean if a hacker is on the same Wi-Fi network as a vulnerable device, they can hijack it without ever touching the device.",
      "From there, attackers could move laterally within a home or corporate network, silently hopping from one device to another. They might install malware or ransomware, disrupt operations or even lock users out of their own systems. In some cases, compromised devices could be added to a botnet, a network of hijacked machines working in unison for larger attacks. And because many smart gadgets come equipped with microphones, hackers could even turn them into tools for eavesdropping and surveillance.",
      "A woman scrolling on her smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "What is Apple doing about the AirBorne bugs?",
      "Apple has already patched the AirBorne bugs on its own devices and issued updates to third-party vendors. However, researchers warn that many third-party AirPlay-enabled products, possibly tens of millions, may never receive a fix, either because they do not auto-update or because vendors are slow or unwilling to release security patches.",
      "A striking demonstration by Oligo showed how easily a Bose speaker was taken over to display the firm's logo, proving how simple it could be for a hacker to silently gain control. Though Bose was not specifically targeted, the example highlights the broader risk. Any unpatched device using AirPlay SDK could be a gateway for malicious actors.",
      "The researchers also discovered that Apple CarPlay is affected. While exploiting it would be harder and would require Bluetooth or USB pairing, more than 800 car and truck models are potentially vulnerable.",

      "Steps to update your iPhone\u2019s software (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO UPDATE ALL OF YOUR DEVICES AND KEEP THEM SAFE",
      "5 ways to protect yourself from AirPlay hackers",
      "1) Set up a separate Wi-Fi network for smart devices:\u00a0Most modern routers allow you to create multiple networks. Use this feature to keep your smart home devices such as AirPlay-enabled speakers, TVs or receivers on a dedicated \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) network. Keep this separate from your main devices, like phones, laptops and work computers. This segmentation ensures that even if a hacker gains access to a vulnerable smart device, they cannot easily reach more critical or sensitive devices on the primary network.",
      "2) Disable AirPlay when not actively using it:\u00a0AirPlay is designed to always be on and discoverable, which makes it convenient but also leaves it exposed. If you rarely use AirPlay or only use it occasionally, go into your device settings and turn it off completely. On Apple devices, AirPlay settings can be found under \"General\" or \"AirPlay & Handoff.\" For third-party devices, check their companion apps or manuals. Turning off AirPlay removes it as an open door for attackers.",
      "3) Avoid using AirPlay on public or unsecured Wi-Fi and use a VPN:\u00a0One of the key conditions for exploiting AirBorne vulnerabilities is that the attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the target device. This makes public Wi-Fi networks in places like caf\u00e9s, airports, hotels or shared workspaces particularly risky. If you need to use your device in such environments, avoid casting, streaming or pairing with smart devices.",
      "Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Strengthen and secure your home Wi-Fi network:\u00a0Make it more difficult for attackers to gain access to your home network. Use a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi that is different from your other account credentials. Ensure that your router firmware is updated and that encryption is set to WPA2 or WPA3. Avoid older and less secure options like WEP or open networks. Turn off features like WPS, which are designed for easy setup but can also make your network more vulnerable. If possible, disable universal plug and play (UPnP) and similar features that make all devices on your network easily discoverable. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Limit device permissions and exposure:\u00a0Smart devices with AirPlay support often include features like microphones, auto-pairing and remote access. Review each device's settings and disable any features you do not actively use. For example, if your smart speaker has a microphone, but you never use voice commands, turn off the microphone or cover it. The fewer functions a device has exposed, the fewer opportunities a hacker has to exploit it. If your router supports it, use device-level firewall rules to limit which services or internet connections your smart gadgets can access.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Apple likes to market itself as the go-to for privacy and security, but the AirBorne vulnerabilities show that the company's devices are far from bulletproof. While they patched their own products, millions of third-party AirPlay devices are still wide open to attack. It's becoming clear that Apple's control over its ecosystem isn't as tight as they'd like you to believe. If they really want to be the privacy leader, they need to step up and fix these issues across the board, not just when it suits them.",

      "Sites like \"Dogequest\" have published names, addresses and phone numbers supposedly belonging to Tesla owners, yet many victims never owned a Tesla or sold theirs years ago. Some were misidentified due to errors in public records or outdated databases, turning ordinary people into targets for harassment and threats. The site's operators have even demanded proof of sale from anyone seeking removal, putting the burden on innocent people to clear their names.",

Many of the people listed never owned a Tesla at all.",
      "The data fueling this attack came from public vehicle registration records and third-party databases, notorious for their inaccuracies. Some victims had sold their Teslas years ago.

      "Kurt Knutsson discusses how a paper pill bottle could revolutionize pharmacy packaging and cut plastic waste drastically.",
      "Have you ever stopped to think about what happens to those little orange pill bottles after you finish your prescription? Every year, around 200 billion of these bottles are produced worldwide, and sadly most of them end up in landfills. In the U.S. alone, about 4 to 5 billion plastic pill bottles are thrown away each year.",
      "That\u2019s enough plastic to circle the Earth multiple times.",
      "While they might seem harmless, these bottles contribute significantly to the growing plastic pollution crisis because they\u2019re often not recycled properly.",

      "Paper Tully Tube pill bottles (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A paper bottle that\u2019s changing the game",
      "Plastic has become the go-to material for packaging, including in medicine, because it\u2019s cheap, durable and easy to produce. However, the environmental cost is huge, and the pharmaceutical industry has struggled to find a sustainable alternative.",
      "Enter the\u00a0Tully Tube, a revolutionary new pill bottle made mostly from 100% sustainably sourced paper. Developed by Parcel Health, this isn\u2019t just any paper bottle. It\u2019s the first one to meet the strict U.S. FDA regulations for food-contact packaging, making it safe to use for prescription medications.",
      "What makes the Tully Tube really impressive is how it balances sustainability with practicality. The body of the bottle is made from recyclable and compostable paper, which means it can break down naturally instead of piling up in landfills. The cap, which needs to be child-resistant for safety, is still made from plastic but uses recycled materials to reduce its environmental impact.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "STOP SORTING YOUR GARBAGE WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY",
      "How does it keep pills safe?",
      "You might be wondering how a paper bottle can protect pills from moisture, heat or damage during shipping. The Tully Tube uses a clever three-layer construction. It\u2019s coated with a food-safe compostable layer that keeps water and humidity out, ensuring your medication stays fresh and effective.",
      "When it\u2019s time to toss the bottle, a patented pull tab makes it easy to separate the paper body from the plastic cap and neck. This means the paper part can be composted or recycled, while the plastic pieces can be recycled separately. It\u2019s a simple but smart way to make sure every part of the bottle is handled properly at the end of its life.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "IS THIS TECHNOLOGY THE ANSWER TO CLEANING UP OUR OCEAN'S PLASTIC PROBLEM?",
      "Why should pharmacies care?",
      "One of the biggest hurdles for sustainable packaging is cost. Fortunately, the Tully Tube is priced competitively with traditional plastic bottles, so pharmacies don\u2019t have to pay more to go green. Plus, because the paper surface is easier and cheaper to print on, pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies can customize the bottles with logos, designs or even characters to make the packaging more engaging for customers.",
      "From an environmental perspective, the Tully Tube reduces carbon emissions by about 30% compared to plastic bottles. That\u2019s a significant cut in greenhouse gases, especially when you consider the billions of bottles used every year.",

      "Real-world impact",
      "UVA Health is already leading the way by rolling out Tully Tubes across its system. This move is expected to eliminate millions of plastic bottles from their waste stream, showcasing how sustainable packaging can work even in industries with strict safety and regulatory standards. Their example proves that eco-friendly alternatives aren\u2019t just theoretical, they\u2019re ready for real-world use today.",

      "VeriSource discovered\u00a0the breach Feb. 28, 2024, when it noticed unusual activity disrupting some of its systems. The company later determined an unknown attacker had gained unauthorized access around Feb. 27, 2024, stealing data on or about that date.",
      "Somehow, it took VeriSource over a year to determine the full scope of the breach, including the identification all individuals who had their information exposed.",
      "According to the investigation, this was a criminal cyberattack carried out by external threat actors (hackers), as opposed to an insider mishandling data. The perpetrators accessed sensitive personal records stored by VeriSource. In a\u00a0sample notice filed with state authorities, VeriSource reported that the compromised information included individuals' full names, mailing addresses, dates of birth, gender and Social Security numbers (via\u00a0BleepingComputer).",

Information like your Social Security number, birth date and address can be misused for identity theft, such as opening fraudulent accounts or filing false tax returns in your name. Even beyond financial fraud, having such personal data in the wrong hands can lead to targeted phishing scams.",
      "What worries me the most is the delay in fully notifying everyone affected. VeriSource had sent out preliminary breach notices to about 55,000 people in May 2024 and then to another 112,000 people in September 2024. However, those early notifications covered only a small fraction of the approximately 4 million victims eventually identified. This means the majority of affected individuals did not learn of the breach until the final notification wave in April 2025, more than a year after the data was actually compromised.",

Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0VeriSource hackers have access to your name, Social Security number, mailing address and more, which they can easily use against you.\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to scam you. After the VeriSource breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the VeriSource breach, including Social Security numbers. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You can freeze your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus. They\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "4. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per yearor more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "5. Be wary of social engineering attacks and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Also, never click on unexpected links or attachments in emails, texts or messages because they may contain malware or lead to phishing sites designed to steal your information.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "What stands out in the VeriSource breach isn\u2019t just the scale, but the silence. When a company sits on breach data for over a year, regardless of intent, it erodes trust in systems designed to protect workers. These aren\u2019t just compliance failures. They\u2019re human ones. Four million people had their most sensitive information exposed, and for many of them, the warning came far too late. This should be a moment of reckoning for how organizations define responsibility after a breach. A timely response isn\u2019t just good PR. It\u2019s a baseline expectation. And if it takes over a year to realize the full scope of a cyberattack, maybe the incident isn\u2019t the only vulnerability worth addressing.",

      "What you need to know",
      "According to a\u00a0legally mandated disclosure with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Yale New Haven Health experienced a cyberattack on March 8 that allowed malicious hackers to obtain copies of patients' personally identifiable information as well as some healthcare-related data.",
      "Yale New Haven Health is a nonprofit healthcare system based in New Haven, Connecticut. It includes five acute-care hospitals, a medical foundation, and a network of outpatient facilities and multispecialty centers across Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "In a\u00a0notice posted on its website, the healthcare system said the stolen data varied by individual but could include names, dates of birth, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, race and ethnicity information, Social Security numbers, types of patients and medical record numbers. Reportedly, the number of affected individuals may still change as investigations continue. Importantly, electronic medical record systems and treatment information were not accessed, and no financial account, payment or employee HR information was involved.",
      "This is not the first time healthcare systems have been in the crosshairs of cybercriminals. In recent years, attacks on institutions like\u00a0UnitedHealth and\u00a0Ascension Health have led to months of operational disruption, massive financial costs and prolonged investigations.",
      "Illustration of a doctor looking at data on a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVER",
      "What Yale New Haven Health is doing",
      "Yale New Haven Health brought in cybersecurity firm Mandiant to assist with the investigation and said a rapid response helped contain the incident and prevent any disruption to patient care. The organization noted that it regularly updates and strengthens its systems to protect sensitive data and will continue those efforts. Notification letters began going out to affected individuals on April 14, and complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services have been offered to those whose Social Security numbers were compromised.",
      "The breach could have serious consequences for those impacted. The stolen data includes highly sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, phishing attacks or targeted scams. Healthcare data is especially valuable on the black market because it can be exploited for long periods without easy detection. Even if Social Security numbers or medical information aren\u2019t misused right away, the long-term risk for affected individuals remains significant.",
      "We reached out to Yale New Haven Health (YNHHS), and a health system spokesperson said in part:",
      "\"We take our responsibility to safeguard patient information incredibly seriously, and we regret any concern this incident may have caused. We are continuously updating and enhancing our systems to protect the data we maintain and to help prevent events such as this from occurring in the future. For more information on this incident, patients may visit YNHHS\u2019 website at\u00a0ynhhs.org or call our dedicated, toll-free call center at 1-855-549-2678, Monday through Friday, between 9:00 am and 9:00 pm Eastern Time, excluding major U.S. holidays.\"",

      "5 ways you can stay safe from insurance data breach",
      "If your information was part of the Yale New Haven Health breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Yale New Haven Health data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, social security number, and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The Yale New Haven Health data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Yale New Haven Health hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses..",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While Yale New Haven has been working with security experts to contain the breach and notify those affected, it is troubling that hackers were able to access the data of 5.5 million individuals before the organization detected the intrusion. The incident highlights a deeper issue, revealing gaps in the security infrastructure that many healthcare institutions are still not adequately addressing.",

      "Manual opt-outs demand a significant time investment, requiring you to personally navigate each data broker\u2019s unique removal process. While free, this approach offers variable coverage depending on how diligently you track down brokers, and consistency is challenging; you\u2019ll need to repeat the process regularly to keep your data private. Success also depends heavily on your ability to decipher vague opt-out instructions and adapt to each broker\u2019s requirements.",
      "In contrast, data removal services save time by handling the legwork for you. They provide broad coverage by targeting numerous brokers simultaneously and maintain consistency through ongoing monitoring. While these services come with subscription fees, they eliminate the need for personal expertise, offering a hands-off solution to data privacy.",
      "The bottom line: Why personal data removal services win the privacy battle",
      "After testing both manual opt-outs and automated services, using a personal data removal service emerges as the clear solution for reclaiming your data. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "If you\u2019ve got the time and patience, you can absolutely take the DIY route. But if you\u2019re looking for a way to protect your privacy without sinking hours into research, filling out forms and monitoring, a data removal service makes things a lot quicker and more convenient. For most people, this is likely the better option. Many states have privacy laws that give you the right to request that data brokers remove your personal information, but the system seems to be rigged to make exercising those rights unreasonably difficult.\u00a0While it shouldn\u2019t be necessary, data removal services offer a way to cheat that system.",

      "The FBI says that\u00a0these scams often target people who have already been victims of fraud, which makes them especially cruel. Scammers reach out through phone calls, emails or even social media, pretending they can help you recover money you\u2019ve lost.",

      "Protecting yourself from scams starts with these critical defenses; each is designed to shut down fraudsters before they gain a foothold on your personal information or money.",
      "1. Stay calm: If you think a scammer is calling you, it's important to stay calm and not let yourself get emotional. It's very easy to get worked up when you're in the middle of this situation. If it happens, you can always say you will get back to them and hang up the phone. If they become aggressive and try to exploit you, tell them you will report them and hang up.",
      "2. Avoid unknown contact numbers:\u00a0Never call phone numbers that appear in pop-ups, unsolicited texts or emails. These numbers often belong to scammers trying to trick you into sharing personal information or making payments. Instead, always verify contact details through official websites or trusted sources before reaching out.",
      "3. Download warning: Do not download software at the request of unknown individuals who contact you. Installing unknown programs can introduce malware or give scammers a way to steal your personal information.",
      "4. Security precaution: Do not allow unknown individuals access to your computer. Granting remote access can give scammers control over your files and personal information, putting your security at serious risk.",
      "5. Don't click that link and have strong antivirus software: Do not click on unsolicited pop-ups on your computer, links sent via text messages or email links and attachments. As scammers weaponize AI and deepfake technologies, strong antivirus software becomes your first line of defense. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on malicious links that install malware that may access your private information is to have strong antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you to any phishing emails or ransomware scams.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Consider identity theft protection services:\u00a0These services monitor your personal information across credit reports, the dark web and public records, alerting you quickly if your data is exposed or misused.

      "\"What we\u2019re seeing is a deliberate attempt to undermine Jewish historical ties to the land,\" Yishai Fleisher, international spokesman for Hebron, the cradle of Jewish civilization located in Judea, told Fox News Digital. \"There are three strategies at play: the Palestinians either acknowledge Jews were once here but argue they no longer belong, deny any Jewish connection at all, or destroy the evidence outright.\"",
      "Fleisher noted ongoing efforts by Palestinian authorities and others to rename historical Jewish sites. \"They call Hebron \u2018Al-Khalil,\u2019 and the Cave of the Patriarchs becomes the \u2018Ibrahimi Mosque.\u2019 The Temple Mount is now the \u2018Al-Aqsa complex,\u2019 and Rachel\u2019s Tomb has been rebranded as the \u2018Bilal Bin Rabah Mosque,\u2019\" he said.",

      "\"This denial,\" Orenstein told Fox News Digital, \"aimed to delegitimize and undermine the Jewish people's legal, moral and historical right to sovereignty in the Land of Israel, portraying a people with some of the deepest archaeological ties to the land as occupiers and colonizers.",
      "\"For that reason, the Islamic Waqf carried out a campaign of systematic destruction of antiquities atop the Temple Mount in the late 1990s, and Palestinian leadership continues to deny, damage, and destroy Jewish heritage sites throughout Judea and Samaria,\" he said.",
      "Following the destruction and severe damage by Palestinian rioters at the 'Joshua Altar' archeological site located on the spur of Mt. Ebal, dozens of Jewish worshipers arrived for morning prayers at the site. (TPS)",

      "\"In every corner of Judea and Samaria, one need only to put spade to ground in order to uncover archaeological finds that attest to our deep roots in the Land of Israel,\" Netanyahu said at the time. \"This plan will encourage tourism, education and [present] information for these important sites that tell the story of our people in Judea and Samaria.\"",
      "Rev. Dr. Petra Heldt, professor at the Jerusalem University College and director of the Ecumenical Theological Research Fraternity in Israel, cited biblical texts and ongoing excavations as proof of longstanding Jewish presence in the region.",
      "\"There are hundreds of biblical place names showing Jews lived in Judea and Samaria since the time of Abraham,\" Heldt told Fox News Digital. \"The Palestinian Authority has tried to erase this evidence, but it\u2019s nearly impossible to eliminate.\"",
      "Heldt pointed to Shiloh as a thriving example, with an active kibbutz and archaeological site where new discoveries are regularly unearthed. \"Jewish communities are not only living in their ancestral homeland\u2014they\u2019re documenting it.

      "Iranian authorities this week have faced mounting accusations of negligence and an attempt to \"cover up\" death toll figures and the strong suspicion it was using a civilian port to import explosive materials for the military.",
      "But what remains largely unknown is the extent of the damage, the economic impact and how it will directly affect Iranians already discontent with the Iranian regime.",
      "IRAN ACCUSED OF 'COVERING UP' DEATH TOLL IN PORT EXPLOSION AMID CONCERNS OF UPRISING",
      "A charred shoe on scorched ground during an emergency activity at Shahid Rajaee port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, April 29, 2025.

      "\"Rajaee Port is Iran's primary hub for maritime exports and imports, particularly for oil-based products,\" Saeed Ghasseminejad,\u00a0a senior advisor on Iran and an expert on its economy with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Ghasseminejad explained that the southern port accounted for 52% of Tehran\u2019s oil trade in terms of volume, 77% of its industrial metals and 85% of all container shipments, though he pointed out it is not Iran's only major port.",
      "A MASSIVE EXPLOSION AT AN IRANIAN PORT LINKED TO MISSILE FUEL SHIPMENT KILLS 5, INJURES OVER 700",
      "\"At this stage, there is no credible damage assessment,\" Ghasseminejad added, noting all guesses at this point about the extent of the damage were speculation based on images of the damage to the containers and the administrative buildings in the port.",
      "But he noted that \"if the damage proves to be extensive and severe, it could place the regime under significant economic and logistical pressure.\"",
      "Just two days after the explosion, Tehran claimed port operations had returned to normal. Iran says the explosion killed 70, but some sources estimate the toll could be closer to 250.",

      "\"A clearer picture should emerge in the coming weeks,\" Ghasseminejad said. \"It is unlikely that the port is back to its normal operation and full capacity given the damage to the administrative buildings, the infrastructure, and the fact that hundreds of people working at the port are unfortunately dead, missing or injured.",
      "\"The regime has the incentive to lie as it wants to show it has control over the situation, but a lot of sources inside Iran in the business community differ.\"",
      "The Iranian regime was accused of \"covering up\" the death toll this week by the NCRI, which has spoken to eyewitnesses at the port, in a move to counter internal dissidence. It also took steps to limit access to information for not only local residents but media outlets, and it downplayed the severity of the incident.",

      "Of the 23 cardinals from Asia eligible to vote, one name comes up again and again, that of Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, sometimes called the \"Philippine Francis.\"",
      "The 67-year-old had a close relationship with Pope Francis and served as his envoy to Asia during the 2015-16 special Jubilee Year, during which he made a brief stop in Taipei, Taiwan. Tagle also accompanied Francis on his first international trip to Asia in 2014, when the pontiff visited South Korea.",

      "Another Asian candidate is Burma's Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, 76, from a country where Catholics represent just about 1% of the population. Meanwhile, over the last several days, reports from\u00a0South Korean newspapers\u00a0are suggesting South Korean Cardinal Lazarus You Heung-sik, 74, is among the leading candidates to succeed Pope Francis.",

      "Francis may one day be rated as among the most influential popes of all time. Pope John Paul II made history by becoming the first pope from Poland and his pontificate lasted 26 years (1978-2006). Francis was head of the Catholic Church for a much shorter time, almost exactly 12 years, but the late pope appointed 80% of the cardinals who will vote for his successor.",
      "The late Holy Father also enlarged the number of cardinals and, for the first time in history, the upcoming conclave will see European cardinals in the minority. However, some experts warn against assuming the next pope will be \"Francis the Second,\" as many of these new cardinals are considered more conservative.",

      "The home nation of Asian cardinals doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the number of Catholics there. In Japan, Catholics make up fewer than 0.5% of the population, but there is a Japanese cardinal who is reasonably active on social media. The largest Asian block of cardinals hails from majority-Hindu India, which has six to the predominately Catholic Philippines\u2019 five.",
      "Still, many Vatican watchers believe Cardinal Tagle remains the most likely Asian candidate, although his progressive stances may prove divisive. Tagle has publicly criticized the church for using \"harsh words\" in past criticisms of LGBTQ Catholics and remarried divorcees and advocates for a more flexible approach. This stance is in line with Pope Francis\u2019 2015 papal declaration that said the church needs to \"avoid judgments which do not take into account the complexity of various situations.\"",

      "Should Tagle beat the odds and become the next pope, his election would energize the church\u2019s progressive wing, as he would likely continue the liberal-leaning direction charted by Francis. His emphasis on serving the poor has won him admiration across Asia and beyond, as has his relatable style. Tagle reportedly prefers being called by his nickname \"Chito,\" rather than by his formal title.",
      "Pope Francis officiating the General Audience in Saint Peter's square. Pope Francis together with Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle. (Photo by Grzegorz Galazka/Archivio Grzegorz Galazka/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images)",
      "Thomas Tu shared a personal story about Tagle\u2019s compassion, recalling an incident before the cardinal received his red hat. After a young seminarian died suddenly, Tagle chose to join the group of senior seminary members and personally visit the grieving family, later giving a moving sermon in which he \"compared the church to a mother, similar to the one who had lost her son,\" Tu said. \"Tagle just has a way of reaching people that is special.\"",
      "Few dispute that the election of the next pope will be among the most consequential moments for the Catholic Church in decades. And, for the first time, candidates from Asia are now part of serious conversations about the future direction of the faith.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs rollout is frustrating U.S. companies\u2019 planning for the rest of the year, preventing some corporate giants from telling investors what to expect and scrambling the broader outlook for stocks.",
      "Mattel and Ford each suspended their 2025 financial forecasts on Monday.",
      "The toy giant told investors that \u201cgiven the volatile macroeconomic environment and evolving U.S. tariff landscape, it is difficult to predict consumer spending and Mattel\u2019s U.S. sales in the remainder of the year and holiday season.\u201d",
      "The company said that Barbie and Hot Wheels, its two flagship brands, were mostly manufactured outside of China, which faces a 145% effective tariff rate from the Trump administration. Still, CEO Ynon Kreiz told CNBC on Tuesday morning that Mattel was considering hiking prices for U.S. consumers to offset the costs of tariffs, which it estimated could come to about $270 million.",
      "\u201cWhere necessary, we will be taking pricing action in the U.S.,\u201d Kreiz said.",
      "Mattel shares have declined by about 25% since February, when Trump first began discussing tariffs in greater detail. By comparison, the broader S&P 500 fell about 8% over the same period.",
      "\u201cThe shape of the toy industry has really changed,\u201d said Brian Benway, senior tech and gaming analyst at the market research firm Mintel, who noted that Mattel\u2019s products are increasingly sold in big-box retailers that are vulnerable to supply-chain snarls. The company said during its earnings call that it was prepared to increase direct imports to help stores keep shelves stocked.",
      "\u201cCould we spin up more U.S.-based production? Yes. Will it be in the next five to 10 years? Probably not,\u201d Benway said.",
      "Ford, too, put its outlook for the year on hold this week, citing lack of clarity about potential retaliatory tariffs from other countries, as well as how consumers may react to price increases. It joined other automakers including Dodge and Ram maker Stellantis, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz in pulling its annual guidance.",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley warned the company\u2019s hit from tariffs would be \u201chuge.\u201d Ford builds several models in Mexico that are sold in the U.S., including the popular electric Mustang Mach-E, Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport.",
      "Trump has softened his stance on tariffs somewhat, but so far no trade deals have materialized. That has left large and small companies alike facing tremendous uncertainty over how much the trade duties could hit their bottom lines.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has continued to downplay the potential impact to consumers from tariffs despite campaigning on immediate economic relief. He told NBC News\u2019 Kristen Welker on Sunday that Americans should in some cases be making do with less.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just saying [Americans] don\u2019t need to have 30 dolls, they can have three,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to have 250 pencils,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can have five.\u201d",
      "Other companies are issuing multiple forecasts that take into account different economic scenarios. United Airlines said last month that \u201ca single consensus no longer exists, and therefore the Company\u2019s expectation has become bimodal \u2014 either the U.S. economy will remain weaker but stable, or the U.S. may enter into a recession.\u201d Most other major airlines, including American, Delta and JetBlue, also either warned of lower earnings or suspended some guidance.",
      "Even some tech companies, many of which were thought to be largely immune from tariffs, signaled they could no longer forecast near-term financial results. That includes Snapchat parent Snap, which declined to issue guidance for the second quarter. But so far, stock investors have been relatively sanguine about the growing chorus of companies admitting they cannot navigate the current environment.",
      "Last week, the S&P 500 returned to the level it had reached before Trump gave his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d speech on April 2, after suffering weeks of heavy losses, though the index ended Monday in the red and was off to a rough start again Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThis is a tricky time for investors,\u201d Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius said in a recent note to clients. \u201cWhile the economy has held up a touch better than expected so far, it\u2019s very early.\u201d All things considered, he said, the recent rally is likely to dissipate in the face of what are likely to be \u201csignificant price hikes, supply chain disruptions, and job losses.\u201d",
      "Other major\u00a0companies reporting earnings this week include Disney, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International, Warner Bros. Discovery and Uber."

      "Columbia University announced Tuesday that it laid off 180 staff members working on federal grants impacted by the Trump administration's decision to revoke the university's funding.",
      "The administration cut $400 million in federal funding from Columbia in March, accusing it of \"inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" It then issued a list of demands to the university, which it mostly acceded to, to start negotiations on restoring the funding.",
      "The demands included banning students from wearing masks at protests, hiring campus security officers who can arrest students, and appointing a new senior vice provost to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies.",
      "The move to cut over 100 staff members was announced in a Tuesday letter from top Columbia officials, including Acting President Claire Shipman and Provost Angela V. Olinto. In the letter, the officials said the university is \"engaged in a two-pronged effort related to grants terminated by the federal government,\" which includes restoring partnerships with government agencies and adjusting or reducing spending in the meantime.",
      "\"Columbia\u2019s leadership continues discussions with the federal government in support of resuming activity on these research awards and additional other awards that have remained active, but unpaid,\" the letter read. \"We are working on and planning for every eventuality, but the strain in the meantime, financially and on our research mission, is intense.\"",
      "University officials said that, as a result of the financial strain, 180 staff members \"who have been working, in whole or in part, on impacted federal grants\" received notices of termination or non-renewal on Tuesday. According to officials, they represent 20% of the staff funded by the grants that the Trump administration funded.",
      "Also, due to financial strain, some schools and departments will wind down activity, and research infrastructure \"will be running lighter footprints,\" according to the officials.",
      "\"We do not make these decisions lightly,\" the top officials said. \"We are deeply committed, at Columbia, to the critical work of invention, innovation and discovery.\"",
      "Last week, hundreds of Columbia University students, faculty, staff and alumni launched a 25-hour \"speak out\" to criticize school leaders for bowing to the Trump administration\u2019s demands after it pulled the millions in federal funding.",

      "\"We are pioneers in biomedical research, legal research, and environmental science research, and all of that got cut simply because the Trump administration had a vendetta against universities,\" he told NBC News.",
      "Columbia \"will continue to make prudent budget decisions,\" even in areas not impacted by federally funded research, to ensure the university's long-term financial stability,\" the officials said in the letter. This includes setting parameters across the university that ensure most salaries will not increase for the next fiscal year, programs to continue streamlining the university's workforce through attrition, and launching \"a voluntary retirement incentive program.\"",
      "\"In the coming weeks and months, we will need to continue to take actions that preserve our financial flexibility and allow us to invest in areas that drive us forward,\" officials said. \"This is a deeply challenging time across all higher education, and we are attempting to navigate through tremendous ambiguity with precision, which will be imperfect at times.\"",

Wendy\u2019s saw first-quarter global sales shrink by 1.1% and reduced its outlook for the year. Chipotle, which also flagged a slowdown, said its limited-time honey chicken offering helped prop up sales, which slid 0.4% for the quarter.",
      "Consumers have been demanding more chicken even as they\u2019ve rebelled against menu price hikes during the past year, sending many restaurant chains racing to roll out value deals and find other ways to keep customers coming back.",
      "Chicken featured in nearly 40% of all Grubhub restaurant orders last year and was purchased almost three times as often as beef by grocery customers, the delivery company said in December.",
      "Visits to chicken chains swelled by 4.3% in the third quarter of 2024 from the same period a year earlier, according to the location analytics firm Placer.ai, while quick-service and fast-casual traffic dipped by 1.3% and 2.4%, respectively. These trends play to the strengths of chicken-focused brands including Dave\u2019s Hot Chicken, Raising Cane\u2019s Chicken Fingers and Church\u2019s Texas Chicken, while putting pressure on burger-centric incumbents.",
      "\u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing this, as much as anything else, is really about competitiveness,\u201d Jonathan Maze, editor-in-chief of Restaurant Business magazine, said of fast-food chains\u2019 embrace of chicken.",
      "Consumers are seeing more stable prices for poultry than they are for many other animal proteins. Chicken costs were up just 1.3% in March from a year earlier, federal data shows, while pork rose 2.9% and beef and veal prices surged 8.6%.",
      "But Maze said the biggest factor may simply be a shift in diners\u2019 tastes \u2014 as fast-food brands themselves have acknowledged. Chicken at Wendy\u2019s \u201cconsistently resonates with our fans, and we do not expect this momentum to slow down,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cOur focus on chicken is more intensive than ever!\u201d",
      "One upside for restaurants, Maze noted, is that chicken makes for ideal finger food, which operators are encouraging by rolling out new dipping sauces.",
      "\u201cIt offers different flavor profiles, allows you to get creative without overcomplicating your operations,\u201d he said.",
      "More chicken options are expected to pop onto menus soon. McDonald\u2019s last month teased plans to reintroduce its chicken Snack Wrap, and Taco Bell says it\u2019s considering permanently adding a crispy chicken option after the limited-run nuggets sold out nationwide in less than a week.",
      "Tyson Foods said Monday that it saw \u201cdouble-digit growth\u201d in its business supplying chicken to quick-service restaurants, a bright spot for the meat producer that said its beef segment is facing \u201cthe most challenging market conditions we have ever seen.\u201d In chicken, though, Tyson said a key measure of quarterly earnings nearly doubled last year\u2019s.",
      "Not all chicken chains are benefiting from the trend, nor are fast-food brands all leaning into chicken because they\u2019re struggling. Taco Bell saw sales jump 9% in the first quarter, boosted not just by chicken nuggets but also by its Steak and Queso Crunchwrap Sliders, parent company Yum Brands reported last week. Meanwhile, Yum\u2019s fried-chicken mainstay KFC has struggled, with its U.S. sales notching a 1% drop, outpaced by those of Wingstop and Raising Cane\u2019s.",
      "Restaurants are trying other things to keep diners coming back, from digital upgrades and subscription programs to sleek new remodels. But for now, chicken looks like one of their most powerful tools.",
      "\u201cAmericans love chicken, frankly, and these big fast-food chains are pretty intent on giving it to them,\u201d Maze said."

      "\u201cThis budget cut does not affect one side or the other. Coming out of Covid, we all learned that Covid did not kill people for being Black or white or Republican or Democrat,\u201d said Barber, who also contributes to MSNBC.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with cutting $880 billion in spending. Democrats in the House and progressive groups argue the GOP will have to make drastic cuts to Medicaid to meet the threshold.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs rollout is frustrating U.S. companies\u2019 planning for the rest of the year, preventing some corporate giants from telling investors what to expect and scrambling the broader outlook for stocks.",
      "Mattel and Ford each suspended their 2025 financial forecasts on Monday.",
      "The toy giant told investors that \u201cgiven the volatile macroeconomic environment and evolving U.S. tariff landscape, it is difficult to predict consumer spending and Mattel\u2019s U.S. sales in the remainder of the year and holiday season.\u201d",
      "The company said that Barbie and Hot Wheels, its two flagship brands, were mostly manufactured outside of China, which faces a 145% effective tariff rate from the Trump administration. Still, CEO Ynon Kreiz told CNBC on Tuesday morning that Mattel was considering hiking prices for U.S. consumers to offset the costs of tariffs, which it estimated could come to about $270 million.",
      "\u201cWhere necessary, we will be taking pricing action in the U.S.,\u201d Kreiz said.",
      "Mattel shares have declined by about 25% since February, when Trump first began discussing tariffs in greater detail. By comparison, the broader S&P 500 fell about 8% over the same period.",
      "\u201cThe shape of the toy industry has really changed,\u201d said Brian Benway, senior tech and gaming analyst at the market research firm Mintel, who noted that Mattel\u2019s products are increasingly sold in big-box retailers that are vulnerable to supply-chain snarls. The company said during its earnings call that it was prepared to increase direct imports to help stores keep shelves stocked.",
      "\u201cCould we spin up more U.S.-based production? Yes. Will it be in the next five to 10 years? Probably not,\u201d Benway said.",
      "Ford, too, put its outlook for the year on hold this week, citing lack of clarity about potential retaliatory tariffs from other countries, as well as how consumers may react to price increases. It joined other automakers including Dodge and Ram maker Stellantis, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz in pulling its annual guidance.",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley warned the company\u2019s hit from tariffs would be \u201chuge.\u201d Ford builds several models in Mexico that are sold in the U.S., including the popular electric Mustang Mach-E, Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport.",
      "Trump has softened his stance on tariffs somewhat, but so far no trade deals have materialized. That has left large and small companies alike facing tremendous uncertainty over how much the trade duties could hit their bottom lines.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has continued to downplay the potential impact to consumers from tariffs despite campaigning on immediate economic relief. He told NBC News\u2019 Kristen Welker on Sunday that Americans should in some cases be making do with less.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just saying [Americans] don\u2019t need to have 30 dolls, they can have three,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to have 250 pencils,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can have five.\u201d",
      "Other companies are issuing multiple forecasts that take into account different economic scenarios. United Airlines said last month that \u201ca single consensus no longer exists, and therefore the Company\u2019s expectation has become bimodal \u2014 either the U.S. economy will remain weaker but stable, or the U.S. may enter into a recession.\u201d Most other major airlines, including American, Delta and JetBlue, also either warned of lower earnings or suspended some guidance.",
      "Even some tech companies, many of which were thought to be largely immune from tariffs, signaled they could no longer forecast near-term financial results. That includes Snapchat parent Snap, which declined to issue guidance for the second quarter. But so far, stock investors have been relatively sanguine about the growing chorus of companies admitting they cannot navigate the current environment.",
      "Last week, the S&P 500 returned to the level it had reached before Trump gave his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d speech on April 2, after suffering weeks of heavy losses, though the index ended Monday in the red and was off to a rough start again Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThis is a tricky time for investors,\u201d Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius said in a recent note to clients. \u201cWhile the economy has held up a touch better than expected so far, it\u2019s very early.\u201d All things considered, he said, the recent rally is likely to dissipate in the face of what are likely to be \u201csignificant price hikes, supply chain disruptions, and job losses.\u201d",
      "Other major\u00a0companies reporting earnings this week include Disney, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International, Warner Bros. Discovery and Uber."

      "A judge ordered Rodney L. Hinton to be remanded with no bond in connection with the death of Hamilton County special deputy Larry Henderson. Hinton, who is charged with aggravated murder, pleaded not guilty.",
      "Before entering a plea, a commotion erupted outside the courtroom where the hearing was held. A man could be heard screaming, \"That's my brother, that's my brother.\"",
      "Deputies immediately escorted Hinton out of the room.",
      "\"Everybody, be calm. We\u2019re going to get through this,\" the judge said as Hinton was led back inside the room.",
      "Authorities accused Hinton of intentionally hitting Henderson on Friday afternoon as he was directing traffic near the University of Cincinnati during graduation. The deputy was taken to the hospital, where he\u00a0died from his injuries.",
      "Officials said Henderson had recently retired and was working as a special deputy\u00a0that day. Hamilton County Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey said Henderson was \"so well-liked and so well-known.\"",

      "Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge told reporters Friday there was a definite connection between the collision and Thursday's fatal police shooting of Hinton's 18-year-old son, Ryan Hinton.",

      "Theetge said the teen was armed.",
      "Carl Beebe, a Cincinnati police officer, said at the Tuesday bond hearing that Rodney Hinton had viewed body camera footage of the shooting shortly before the collision. Video released by police showed an officer exit his vehicle and point his gun at the teen, who appeared to be running away.",
      "The officer fired at least four times, Theetge said Friday. She said she believes the 18-year-old was hit by two bullets, one in the chest and one in the arm. In another video, an officer could be heard yelling, \"He\u2019s got a gun!\" The entire incident was only six seconds, she said at a news conference.",
      "Authorities said the gun was recovered at the scene. Theetge on Friday defended the officer\u2019s actions, saying that they often have to make \"split-second decisions to protect others and themselves when faced with immediate threats.\" Theetge said that the officer who shot the teen had said Ryan Hinton pointed the gun at him.",
      "\"Let me be very direct: We cannot allow individuals to flee from officers with a loaded firearm aimed at them,\" Theetge said. \"When this happens, the outcome is almost always tragic. No one wins, and everyone involved is affected.\"",
      "The Hinton family held a news conference Monday to address the shooting.",
      "\"I want to give condolences out to the officers who got hurt, who got killed, the whole family,\" said Rodney Hinton Sr., Ryan\u2019s grandfather. \"I\u2019m gonna ask for forgiveness, and I\u2019ve been praying hard for the officer that killed my grandson.\"",
      "The officer who shot Ryan Hinton has not been named.",
      "Family members said the older Hinton was \"upset\" and \"agitated\" after viewing the video, and they had concerns about him driving, Officer Beebe said during the Tuesday bond hearing.",
      "Because of their concerns, relatives drove Hinton from the station, but he later returned to pick up his vehicle from the parking lot, Beebe said.",
      "\"He actually left the parking lot, followed by some family members and another car, and then a few minutes later returned to the parking lot ... drove through the parking lot and left the parking lot again,\" he said.",
      "From there, Hinton drove toward the university and appeared to stop before he allegedly \"accelerated quickly ... through the intersection where deputy Henderson was standing,\" Beebe said. The vehicle struck the deputy and a utility pole, according to Beebe, who said there was no indication that Hinton tried to stop.",
      "Henderson was \"launched several feet through the air,\" the officer said.",
      "\"He came to rest in a turn lane several feet from where the collision occurred,\" Beebe said.",
      "In its argument for no bond, the state said Hinton was a \"giant mental health question mark\" and a danger to law enforcement and the public, and cited past run-ins with the law, including a domestic violence incident and assault convictions.",
      "Hinton's attorney, Clyde Bennett, said at the hearing he wanted to make sure that his client was \"treated as a mentally ill person and not as a cop killer.\"",

      "The administration cut $400 million in federal funding from Columbia in March, accusing it of \"inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" It then issued a list of demands to the university, which it mostly acceded to, to start negotiations on restoring the funding.",
      "The demands included banning students from wearing masks at protests, hiring campus security officers who can arrest students, and appointing a new senior vice provost to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies.",
      "The move to cut over 100 staff members was announced in a Tuesday letter from top Columbia officials, including Acting President Claire Shipman and Provost Angela V. Olinto. In the letter, the officials said the university is \"engaged in a two-pronged effort related to grants terminated by the federal government,\" which includes restoring partnerships with government agencies and adjusting or reducing spending in the meantime.",
      "\"Columbia\u2019s leadership continues discussions with the federal government in support of resuming activity on these research awards and additional other awards that have remained active, but unpaid,\" the letter read. \"We are working on and planning for every eventuality, but the strain in the meantime, financially and on our research mission, is intense.\"",
      "University officials said that, as a result of the financial strain, 180 staff members \"who have been working, in whole or in part, on impacted federal grants\" received notices of termination or non-renewal on Tuesday. According to officials, they represent 20% of the staff funded by the grants that the Trump administration funded.",

      "\"We are pioneers in biomedical research, legal research, and environmental science research, and all of that got cut simply because the Trump administration had a vendetta against universities,\" he told NBC News.",
      "Columbia \"will continue to make prudent budget decisions,\" even in areas not impacted by federally funded research, to ensure the university's long-term financial stability,\" the officials said in the letter. This includes setting parameters across the university that ensure most salaries will not increase for the next fiscal year, programs to continue streamlining the university's workforce through attrition, and launching \"a voluntary retirement incentive program.\"",
      "\"In the coming weeks and months, we will need to continue to take actions that preserve our financial flexibility and allow us to invest in areas that drive us forward,\" officials said. \"This is a deeply challenging time across all higher education, and we are attempting to navigate through tremendous ambiguity with precision, which will be imperfect at times.\"",

Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he wouldn't support Ed Martin, President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, likely blocking the path to confirmation for the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer who had closely aligned himself with Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve indicated to the White House I wouldn\u2019t support his nomination,\u201d\u00a0Tillis said Tuesday after meeting with Martin on Monday night.",
      "Tillis is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is overseeing Martin's nomination. The panel has 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats, meaning if all other members aside from Tillis voted along party lines, the vote on Martin would end in a tie and his nomination would not be reported favorably to the full Senate.",
      "Trump's nomination of Martin, a longtime right-wing activist who had no prosecutorial experience until Trump named him as interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia on the day of his inauguration, has raised major concerns with alumni of the office, which prosecutors both federal and local crimes in Washington.",
      "Tillis said his concerns about Martin\u2019s involvement in the defense of people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021,\u00a0were too much to overcome, but said that Martin agreed with him that there were hundreds of individuals who shouldn't have been included in Trump's mass pardons.",
      "\u201cMr. Martin did a good job of explaining the one area that I think he\u2019s probably right, that there were some people that were over prosecuted, but there were some, two or three hundred of them that should have never gotten a pardon,\" Tillis said. \"If Mr. Martin were being put forth as a U.S. attorney for any district except the district where Jan. 6 happened, the protest happened, I\u2019d probably support him, but not in this district.\u201d",
      "As interim U.S. attorney, Martin opened up an investigation into the D.C. office's handling of Jan. 6 cases, and several federal prosecutors who worked on Capitol attack cases were fired during his tenure, while Martin demoted others. Martin's term as interim U.S. attorney is set to expire on May 20.",
      "In a speech at the Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021, Martin called on \u201cdie-hard true Americans\u201d to work\u00a0until their \u201clast breath\u201d to \u201cstop the steal.\u201d Martin's association with a far-right Jan. 6 rioter who had posed in a Adolph Hitler mustache and who the Justice Department had called  \u201can avowed white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer\" also raised concerns during his nomination process, and Martin sought to distance himself from the defendant.",
      "Asked why the committee hadn't moved forward with Martin's nomination, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, \"I want to put people on the agenda that I can help the president be successful in his nominees and and that\u2019s all I can say at this point.\"",
      "Trump has pushed senators to support Martin as recently as Monday night, writing in a post on Truth Social that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his health secretary, believed Martin's confirmation was \"IMPERATIVE in terms of doing all that has to be done to SAVE LIVES and to, MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN.\""

      "The two goals will \"inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza,\" U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said in a briefing Monday in New York.",
      "More than 52,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the local Health Ministry, since Israel launched its offensive in the enclave following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, which marked a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Around 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage into Gaza in the attacks, with more than 50 people, both dead and alive, believed to remain in Hamas' captivity, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The families of hostages who remain held in Gaza have warned that a ramped-up offensive will only put the lives of their loved ones at further risk.",
      "Meanwhile, right-wing ministers in Netanyahu\u2019s fragile government coalition celebrated the plans for an expanded offensive, having advocated for such a move before and after the last ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which held for two months from Jan. 19 to March 18.",
      "Prior to that ceasefire, the Israeli military had taken control of around a third of Gaza.",
      "Even so, hopes remained in Gaza and Israel for a resumption of that truce ahead of a visit from President Donald Trump to the region planned for next week.",
      "While Trump has repeatedly touted a proposal for the U.S. to eventually take ownership of the Gaza Strip, Palestinians there implored him to take action to halt Israel\u2019s plans for an expanded offensive.",
      "Khan Younis resident Abu Muhsin, 55, asked \u201cWhere is Trump who calls for freedom and democracy?\u201d",
      "In Israel, meanwhile, Cabinet Minister Ze\u2019ev Elkin said Monday that a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d remained for talks to resume.",
      "From outside of his Cabinet, Netanyahu has faced growing criticism for resuming and expanding Israel's offensive in Gaza. The latest denunciation came from Eran Duvdevani, a prominent retired colonel who led a campaign by former and reserve Israeli paratroopers calling for an end to the war.",
      "Duvdevani told NBC News that a growing number of reservists were already rejecting calls to return to service in a war they increasingly view as politically motivated.",
      "He added that without a fresh truce between Israel and Hamas, Trump's intervention was likely the only thing that could stop an expanded offensive.",
      "\"This is the only way, to press Netanyahu,\" Duvdevani said in a phone interview early Tuesday. \"Nothing will happen if Trump will not press him.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a hearing for\u00a0Netanyahu's testimony in his ongoing public corruption trial ended early Tuesday, according to Israeli newspaper\u00a0The Times of\u00a0Israel. It came as the Israeli military issued an evacuation warning for Yemen\u2019s Sanaa Airport ahead of what appeared to be a pending attack."

    "story": [
      "Mattel said it\u2019s considering raising prices on U.S. toy shoppers, a warning that comes one day after President Donald Trump doubled down on comments that American children don\u2019t need more than a handful of dolls.",
      "\u201cToys are such an essential part of children\u2019s lives,\u201d Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz told CNBC on Tuesday morning.",
      "While the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars is \u201ccommitted to the uninterrupted supply of quality products at a wide range of affordable price points,\u201d he said, Trump\u2019s tariffs have put price hikes on the table: \u201cWhere necessary, we will be taking pricing action in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Analysts warned there\u2019s a limit to what households will want to pay for dolls, games and matchbox cars after shouldering years of steep cost increases for essential goods.",
      "\u201cConsumers are extremely price-sensitive when it comes to toys,\u201d said Brian Benway, senior tech and gaming analyst at the market research firm Mintel.",
      "Mattel said Monday that it still expects 40% to 50% of its products to cost $20 or less, but warned in its first-quarter earnings report that it\u2019s \u201coperating in an uncertain macro-economic environment with significant volatility, including changes in global trade policy.\u201d As a result, the company held off providing a financial outlook for the year, a step Ford also took Monday.",
      "The toy maker said global sales rose 2% from a year earlier, adding that it expects \u201cnot only to manage through this period but strengthen our competitive position.\u201d But its latest warnings of potential price increases, which the company also floated in February, come amid ongoing trade policy turbulence that is drawing growing alarms from corporate c-suites.",
      "Mattel\u2019s stock has fallen more than 18% since April 2, the day Trump unveiled a sweeping set of global tariffs that he partially walked back days later. The erratic tariff rollout \u2014 which has featured numerous delays, revisions and surprises, including a new proposal to slap levies on foreign films \u2014\u00a0comes at a tough time for a toy industry that Trump\u2019s recent remarks have thrust into the spotlight.",
      "\u201cMaybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\u201d Trump  said at a Cabinet meeting last week, \u201cand maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\u201d",
      "Though he campaigned on providing immediate economic relief, the president and his allies have more recently suggested that Americans may need to endure short-term pain as the administration\u2019s trade policies take hold.",
      "That may disappoint some of his supporters. At a Trump campaign stop in Walker, Michigan, in September, one young Chicagoan named Maeve told NBC News, \u201cI want him to lower prices and lower the taxes and make Barbies cheaper. And Polly Pockets. All my favorite toys are so expensive.\u201d",
      "Trump defended his comments about dolls in an interview with NBC News\u2019 Kristen Welker on Sunday.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are going to be great for us because it\u2019s going to make us rich,\u201d he said, dismissing concerns of potential product shortages while indicating Americans could see a narrower range of purchases. \u201cI don\u2019t think a beautiful baby girl that\u2019s 11 years old needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls.\u201d",
      "Toys are among the many consumer purchases that analysts expect tariffs to make more expensive. Nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. are imported from China, the Toy Association estimates. The trade group has said it\u2019s advocating for \u201c0% reciprocal tariffs around the world, to ensure that safe, affordable, and high-quality toys remain accessible to all children,\u201d a goal Kreiz told CNBC that Mattel supports.",
      "Benway noted that more than 40% of Mattel\u2019s products are now sold by big-box retailers known for low prices.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about a 145% tariff, that\u2019s doubling the cost of a toy at Walmart or Target,\u201d he said, referring to the effective U.S. tariff rate on most Chinese imports. \u201cI don\u2019t know how average consumers are going to react to a $20 toy suddenly being $40 just because someone said so. Probably not great.\u201d",
      "It remains to be seen how much of its tariff-related cost increases, which Mattel expects to start seeing around the holiday shopping period, the company could pass along to customers. Executives also told investors Monday that they were prepared to boost direct imports if retailers reduce their inventories, to ensure that their items remain available to U.S. shoppers.",
      "Mattel estimates less than 20% of its U.S. toy production is based in China, about half the current level for its overall global manufacturing. The company is now \u201caccelerating\u201d efforts to spread production out further, including by expanding in India, so that no single country will comprise more than 25% of its global output by 2027 \u2014 when it expects less than 10% to be based in China.",
      "Asked on CNBC on Tuesday whether Mattel could realistically bring more manufacturing back into the U.S. \u2014 one of the Trump administration\u2019s top goals with tariffs \u2014 Kreiz said, \u201cWe don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d"

      "A fifth of the U.S. population identifies as Hispanic or Latino, according to the\u00a0U.S. Census Bureau. Hispanics are now the second-largest demographic in the U.S. and the second-fastest growing ethnic group, agency data shows.",
      "As the population of Hispanic consumers grows, so does their purchasing power \u2014 and their contribution to companies\u2019 bottom lines. According to the\u00a0latest data\u00a0from economic think tank Latino Donor Collaborative, the U.S. Latino economy grew to $3.6 trillion in 2022, up from $3.2 trillion the prior year. And when it comes to shopping, Hispanic Americans overall spend more on consumer packaged goods and outpace non-Hispanic consumers, according to\u00a0market research firm Circana.",
      "But the White House\u2019s hard-line\u00a0immigration\u00a0stance and broader economic concerns have led some Hispanic consumers to pull back their spending.",
      "Hispanic consumers drove a sharp decline in consumer net purchase intent in January, although the trend moderated in February, according to a research note from Goldman Sachs, citing HundredX data. The metric refers to the ratio of customers who intend to buy more from a brand subtracted from those who plan to buy less.",
      "A contributing factor to the dip, some\u00a0experts say, is fear around stricter immigration policy.",
      "While the Trump administration has\u00a0deported fewer people\u00a0than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration during the year-ago period, reports from Immigration and Customs Enforcement show it is holding 10% more detainees than it was under Biden.",

      "But Constellation provided a weaker-than-expected outlook for its fiscal 2026, citing both tariffs and\u00a0diminished spending from Hispanic consumers.",
      "\u201cThe fact is, a lot of consumers in the Hispanic community are concerned right now. \u2026 Over half are concerned relative to immigration issues and how those impact [them]. A number of them are concerned about job losses in industries that have a high Latino employment base,\u201d Newlands said on the company\u2019s conference call in early April.",
      "The Latino unemployment rate ticked up to a seasonally adjusted 5.2% in April, from 4.8% a year earlier and 5.1% in March, according to the\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "\u201cThings like social gatherings, an area where the Hispanic consumer often consumes beer, are declining today,\u201d Newlands added.",
      "Constellation, which also owns Corona, has repeatedly self-reported that Hispanic Americans make up roughly half of the company\u2019s overall beer business. Hispanic- and Latino-identifying customers accounted for 32.5% of Constellation Brands\u2019 sales in 2023, according to data from consumer research firm Numerator and investment bank Jefferies.",
      "And Constellation isn\u2019t the only brewer seeing a downturn. Sam Adams\u2019 owner\u00a0Boston Beer\u00a0referred to a similar decline in its quarterly report.",
      "\u201cThe macroeconomic winds are obviously the consumer confidence, the fear of inflation; there is also some pullback from the Hispanic consumers that they\u2019re just not going out as much,\u201d said Boston Beer CEO Michael Spillane.",
      "Hispanic consumers are also pulling back on their non-alcoholic beverage purchases.",
      "Spending by Hispanic consumers has softened over the last couple of months,\u00a0Keurig Dr Pepper\u00a0CEO Tim Cofer said on the company\u2019s conference call in late April.",
      "\u201cWhen you dig into that, you see that manifesting both in terms of fewer trips and lower spend per trip,\u201d he told analysts.",
      "Hispanic consumers make up \u201ca meaningful percentage\u201d of Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s business and broader consumer packaged goods category, according to Cofer. The company owns\u00a0brands popular with Hispanic consumers\u00a0like Squirt soda, Pe\u00f1afiel mineral water and Clamato, which can be mixed with beer to make micheladas.",
      "Still, the slowdown was not enough to cause Keurig Dr Pepper to lower its full-year outlook.",
      "Rival Coca-Cola also didn\u2019t trim its\u00a0forecast, but it is prioritizing winning back Hispanic consumers next quarter.",
      "For years, the company has targeted Latinos through advertising and acquisitions, like the 2017 purchase of Mexico\u2019s Topo Chico. Mexico is also a top market for its namesake beverage. But this quarter, executives said weaker traffic from Hispanic shoppers weighed on its North American volume, fueled in part by a boycott.",

      "Residents have scrambled to motor vehicle offices nationwide to upgrade their IDs to meet the deadline, and state officials have warned about overcrowding and long lines.",
      "As the policy is set to take effect this week, here\u2019s what you need to know about REAL ID.",
      "What is a REAL ID?",
      "A REAL ID is a security-enhanced, state-issued driver\u2019s license, learner\u2019s permit or nondriver identification card that is offered by all 50 states.",
      "\u201cBeginning May 7, 2025 every state and territory resident will need to present a REAL ID-compliant license/ID, or another acceptable form of identification, for accessing federal facilities, entering nuclear power plants, and boarding commercial aircraft,\u201d according to the DHS website. \u201cThe card, itself, must be REAL ID compliant unless the resident is using an alternative acceptable document such as a passport or passport card, or state-issued Enhanced Driver\u2019s License.\u201d",
      "\u201cStarting on May 7, 2025, a state-issued driver\u2019s license or ID that is not REAL ID compliant will no longer be accepted as a valid form of identification at airports,\u201d the TSA said on its website.",
      "REAL ID-compliant identification cards are marked with a star on the top right corner. The star is usually black or gold and may vary depending on the state.",
      "When was the REAL ID Act introduced?",
      "Congress passed the REAL ID Act in 2005 to enhance security as part of the 9/11 Commission\u2019s recommendations that the federal government \u201cset standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver\u2019s licenses,\u201d according to DHS.",
      "The act changed minimum security standards, and it prohibits federal agencies such as DHS and the Transportation Security Administration from accepting certain identification cards that aren\u2019t REAL ID-compliant and don\u2019t meet the act\u2019s standards.",
      "How do you get a REAL ID?",
      "People can get REAL IDs from their\u00a0states\u2019 driver\u2019s licensing agencies and should check the agencies\u2019 websites to find out the exact requirements, according to the DHS.",
      "DHS said on its website that at a minimum, people must provide documentation showing: full legal name, date of birth, Social Security number, two proofs of address and lawful immigration status.",

      "Will the TSA accept a temporary paper card for a REAL ID?",
      "According to the TSA\u2019s website, it may take up to three weeks to get your REAL ID in the mail and the agency \u201cwill not accept the temporary paper card given at the DMV.\u201d",
      "What happens if I don\u2019t bring REAL ID-compliant identification to the airport?",
      "If people present identification that isn\u2019t REAL ID-compliant at TSA checkpoints and also don\u2019t have acceptable, alternative forms of identification, such as passports or Enhanced IDs, they \u201cmay be directed to a separate area and may receive additional screening.

      "A passport is still necessary for adults and children who are traveling internationally, but to travel domestically, adults will need one valid form of ID, such as a REAL ID or a passport.",
      "Do minors need REAL IDs?",
      "No. For domestic travel, the TSA doesn\u2019t require children under 18 to provide identification when they are traveling with companions. Companions do have to present an acceptable form of identification, according to DHS. Children will still need passports for international travel.",
      "Are there alternatives or exceptions to REAL ID?",
      "Yes. According to DHS, other forms of acceptable identification for domestic travel include passports and Enhanced ID cards.",
      "What can you expect at the airport?",
      "Steve Lorincz, the TSA\u2019s Deputy Executive Assistant Administrator for Security Operations, told NBC News on Tuesday \u201cone of the things that we would recommend is just give yourself plenty of time not only for parking, but checking in with the airlines, and give yourself the opportunity to make sure that you go through the screening process.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump will meet Tuesday with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the man whose country Trump has repeatedly floated as a potential 51st state as he touched off trade disputes with the U.S.'s historically steadfast ally.",
      "Tuesday morning's meeting marks the first time the two leaders have come face-to-face. It comes just over a week after Canadians backed Carney's Liberal Party in elections that were widely seen as influenced by the country's newly tense relationship with its southern neighbor.",
      "Carney, a Trump critic, directly invoked the U.S. president in a victory speech in which he argued that Trump's comments about Canada becoming a 51st state were \"not idle threats.\"",
      "\"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never, that will never, ever happen,\" Carney told supporters.",
      "Shortly before the two leaders were set to meet, Trump fired off a Truth Social post criticizing Canada and claiming that the U.S. doesn't \"need ANYTHING they have other than their friendship.\"",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t need their Cars, we don\u2019t need their Energy, we don\u2019t need their Lumber, we don\u2019t need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship, which hopefully we will always maintain,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThey, on the other hand, need EVERYTHING from us! The Prime Minister will be arriving shortly and that will be, most likely, my only question of consequence.\u201d",
      "The U.S. imports hundreds of billions in goods from Canada, including auto parts, crude oil, lumber and aluminum.",
      "The Canadian prime minister said in a Friday post to X his meeting with Trump would \"focus on addressing immediate trade pressures \u2014 and the future economic and security relationship between our two sovereign nations.\"",
      "The two leaders have previously spoken by phone, and Trump said he congratulated Carney after his victory, calling the prime minister \"very nice\" during an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "When asked whether Trump would talk with Carney about making Canada a 51st state \u2014 a frequent refrain for Trump \u2014 the president said, \"I'll always talk about that.\"",
      "\"When I look down at that without that artificial line that was drawn with a ruler many years ago \u2014 was just an artificial line, goes straight across,\" Trump told \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker, referring to maps of the U.S. and Canada. \"You don\u2019t even realize what a beautiful country it would be. It would be great.\"",
      "Trump's repeated comments about annexing a sovereign nation and a strong U.S. ally have touched off a wave of anti-American sentiment in Canada.",
      "Hockey fans in Canada have booed the American national anthem before games. Some Canadians began boycotting U.S. products. And after the Trump administration hit Canada with tariffs, Canadian politicians fired back with tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "Trump had argued that tariffs on Canada and Mexico were necessary in part to push the countries to crack down on fentanyl entering the U.S. from their shared borders. Out of the 21,900 pounds of fentanyl seized on the border by U.S. authorities in fiscal year 2024, only 43 pounds were seized on the northern border, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.",
      "On Monday, Carney posted a video to X of him arriving in the U.S., writing that \"Canada and the United States are strongest when we work together \u2014 and that work starts now.\""

      "During Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, Francis became increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the Israeli military\u2019s harsh tactics while also demanding the return of hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7. Last year, he urged an investigation into whether Israel\u2019s war amounted to genocide -\u2013 a charge Israel vehemently denies.",

The barrage was the second such attack this week on a city that had been a hub for people fleeing Sudan\u2019s two-year war.",
      "There was no immediate word on any casualties or the extent of the damage. Local media reported loud sound of explosions and fires at the port and the airport. Footage circulating online showed thick smoke rising over the area.",
      "The attack on Port Sudan, which also serves as an interim seat for Sudan\u2019s military-allied government, underscores that after two years of fighting, the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are still capable of threatening each other\u2019s territory.",
      "The RSF drones struck early in the morning, said two Sudanese military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "Abdel-Rahman al-Nour, a Port Sudan resident, said he woke up to strong explosions, and saw fires and plumes of black smoke rising over the port. Msha\u2019ashir Ahmed, a local journalist living in Port Sudan, said fires were still burning late Tuesday morning in the southern vicinity of the maritime port.",
      "The attack apparently disrupted air traffic at the airport, with Cairo airport data in neighboring Egypt showing that three Port Sudan-bound flights were canceled on Tuesday.",
      "The RSF did not release any statements on the attack. On Sunday, the paramilitary force struck Port Sudan for the first time in the war, disrupting air traffic in the city\u2019s airport, which has been the main entry point for the county in the last two years.",
      "A military ammunition warehouse in the Othman Daqna airbase in the city was also hit, setting off a fire that burned for two days.",
      "When the fighting in Sudan broke out, the focus of the battles initially was the country\u2019s capital, Khartoum, which turned into a war zone. Withing weeks, Port Sudan, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) to the east of Khartoum, turned into a safe haven for the displaced and those fleeing the war. Many aid missions and U.N. agencies moved their offices there.",
      "The attacks on Port Sudan are also seen as retaliation after the Sudanese military earlier this month struck the Nyala airport in South Darfur, which the paramilitary RSF has turned into a base and where it gets shipments of arms, including drones.",
      "The RSF is allied with the United Arab Emirates, which U.N. experts say has provided weapons, including drones to the paramilitary. The UAE denies the claim. Sudan\u2019s miliary is backed by Egypt.",
      "Sudan plunged into chaos in April 2023, when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open warfare in Khartoum. From there, the fighting spread to other parts of the country.",
      "Since then, at least 24,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher. The war has driven about 13 million people from their homes, including four million crossed into neighboring countries. It also pushed parts of the country into famine.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western Darfur region, according to the United Natios. and international rights groups."

      "The group, called Super UW, said on its Facebook page that it \"launched an occupation of the new Boeing-funded engineering building\" and was staging a protest over the aviation company's defense contracts and arms sales to Israel.",
      "Super UW said it took the action to mark the anniversary of Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 \u2014 in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped \u2014 calling it a \"heroic victory.\"",
      "\"About 30 individuals who occupied the building were arrested [on] charges of trespassing, property destruction and disorderly conduct, and conspiracy to commit all three, will be referred to the King County Prosecutor\u2019s Office,\" university spokesperson Victor Balta said in a statement.",
      "The protest is a possible sign that this summer could see a repeat of the widespread pro-Palestine encampments, occupations and marches that took place on college campuses across the country last year.",
      "Balta said university police and other law enforcement officers began clearing away crowds of supporters, many wearing black masks, outside the building at 10:30 p.m. on Monday before police moved inside at 11 p.m.",
      "The group created a \"dangerous environment\" in and around the building by blocking entrances by stacking furniture and setting two dumpsters on fire in the street outside, Balta said.",
      "The university's statement also said it \"strongly condemns this illegal building occupation\" and an unspecified \"antisemitic statement\" made by a suspended student group on Monday. The statement said it would \"not be intimidated by this offensive and destructive behavior.\"",
      "The Seattle Police Department referred questions to the University of Washington Police Department.",
      "The newly opened 75,000-square-foot Interdisciplinary Engineering Building, which cost about $102 million and opened this Spring, was partially funded by a $10 million donation from Boeing.",
      "Super UW posted on Facebook just before 9 p.m., on Monday, \"SHOW UP TO THE IEB NOW!!! THE CROWD IS WHAT\u2019S DETERRING THE POLICE FROM MOVING IN.\"",
      "The group claimed that the university had struck a deal to create a \"pipeline of students into the Boeing workforce,\" and allow the company's executives control over its curriculum. At the same time, it accused the university of being complicit in the \"mass genocide of Palestinian people.\"",
      "Greg Hyslop, Boeing's chief engineer and executive vice president of engineering, test, and technology,\u00a0announced the partnership,\u00a0saying it would allow the company to \"partner more closely with the university on cutting-edge technologies.\"",
      "UW was the site of pro-Palestinian protests last year, when a\u00a0three-week\u00a0encampment ended when university management negotiated an end to the protest.",
      "Protesters at Columbia University in New York had planned to start a new encampment there last month, but activists failed to show."

    "summary": "Colombian superstar Karol G opens up in a TODAY interview about her revealing new Netflix documentary, out May 8 \u2014 and how she's returning to her authentic self.",
    "story": [
      "Karol G's 2023 last album, \"Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito,\" was her most revealing to date.",
      "The first track sets a vulnerable tone, with lyrics translating to: \"Give me time / Because I'm now in my best moment / But I'm getting better little by little, yes / Today I'm down, but tomorrow will be more beautiful.\"",
      "Now, the Colombian superstar is opening up even further in the new Netflix documentary \"Ma\u00f1ana Fue Bonito,\" which translates to \"Tomorrow Was Beautiful,\" a reflection of the point of her career where she found herself at her highest professionally \u2014 despite being at one of her lowest personally.",
      "The film \u2014 which hits the streamer on May 8 \u2014 brings viewers inside the story of how the Grammy winner rose from a little girl in Medell\u00edn with dreams of singing to an international superstar.",
      "There are plenty of tears, but there is also a lot of laughter, celebration and triumph \u2014 especially after many on Karol's team advised her against a stadium tour, and she persisted anyway. She went on to become the first-ever Latina to headline a global stadium tour.",
      "Directed by Cristina Costantini (who also helmed \"Mucho, Mucho Amor\" about the life of famed astrologer Walter Mercado, and the upcoming \"Sally\" about astronaut Sally Ride), \u201cTomorrow Was Beautiful\" also touches on the singer's personal life. After a breakup from a very public relationship, her most recent album was beloved by fans for artfully capturing the realities of heartbreak. In the documentary, she opens up for the first time about the experience.",
      "\"Love can make you feel like the happiest person on Earth, but at the same time it can destroy you, your dreams, your whole world... everything you are,\" she says in the film.",
      "There's a lot of people feeling the same...and they don't have the words...but they can with my music, my testimony, my journey. And I love that.",
      "Karol G",
      "Ultimately, though, \u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito\" the album, tour, and now the documentary are all about Karol learning to love herself again. And after initially keeping the details private, she's also slowly opening up about learning to fall in love again, too: This time, into a \"healthy relationship\" with fellow Colombian superstar Feid. In the doc, she credits him as the person she's most been able to visualize herself with. On TODAY May 6, she told the third hour anchors: \"He understands what I do, I understand what he does. He is a really special soul. It is a blessing to have him.\"",
      "When asked if she was nervous about opening up about her love life for the first time in the Netflix doc, she admits in an interview with TODAY.com that it was a hard decision to make.",
      "\"I had a relationship that was like, super public, and everybody was into it ... so to have that hard moment of the breakup, in front of millions of eyes, was difficult,\" she says.",
      "\"But I think now it has become something that is part of my journey. I think I healed in front of my fans with my music. I understood that there\u2019s a lot of people feeling the same, and they are not able to speak about it, or they don\u2019t have the words, but they can with my music \u2014 with my testimony, with my journey. And I love that.\"",
      "Her love life, however, wasn't the hardest part for Karol to open up about. That, she says, was the portion where she reveals the real reason why she almost quit music more than a decade ago. As she previously told TODAY, in 2012, she decided she was done with singing and moved to New York to study business and English.",
      "But in the documentary, she explains that what truly led her to become \"disillusioned\" and take a break from music was a manager who came on to her when she was only 16 years old.",
      "\"It broke my heart, because it was like ... you are putting me in a situation in which you're using my hopes and dreams and putting this condition on achieving them,\" she says in the film, before adding that she couldn't bring herself to tell her parents what happened at the time.",
      "She tells TODAY.com now the scene in the documentary was so difficult for her to record, she has still yet to watch \"Tomorrow Was Beautiful\" with anyone but herself. But it was important for her to share her experience in the hopes that it will help other women.",
      "\"When I started being surrounded by different women in this industry, I started noticing that there was a cycle \u2014 that a lot of us have experienced something similar,\" she says. \"I wanted to share this moment so women can feel OK knowing that they can say no, and they can open that door and they can leave. And to feel comfortable in that.\"",
      "With her documentary also comes another transition: A hair color change. Famous for rocking different shades throughout her career stages (blue for her \u201cKG0516\u201d album; red and then pink for  \u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito\u201d), Karol G is now sporting brown.",
      "\"I just went back to my natural color of my hair, because there is so much going on right now, so much coming right now,\" she says. \"And I think I really wanted to be my most natural and original and authentic and genuine version of myself.\"",
      "Clearly, tomorrow really was beautiful. And the day after that will be, too."

He also recently spoke on a panel with Miller and more to discuss the importance of Harlem in Black fashion and culture.",
      "In his interview with TODAY.com, Wellington opens up about being raised in Harlem and how he became inspired by Black dandyism after watching films featuring Harry Belafonte, the Nicholas Brothers, Lena Horne and other icons.",
      "\u201cI grew up in Harlem where fashion is always on display in the community and in the culture,\u201d he says.",
      "He says growing up in a neighborhood with a rich history and consuming so many classic Hollywood films made him enamored with the \u201cundeniable\u201d artistry that Black dandyism represents.",
      "What is Black dandyism?",
      "Wellington tells TODAY.com he was \u201cbeyond excited\u201d when he heard about the 2025 Met Gala theme and is looking forward to the interpretations he hopes to see on the red carpet.",
      "\u201cThere are so many unique, profound and inspiring examples of Black style,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m really excited that the exhibit is going to be covering everything, from enslavement to hip-hop. We\u2019re talking about three centuries of Black cultural expression.\u201d",
      "The bandleader adds, \u201cWhen it comes to the Met Gala theme I\u2019m really excited to see how people engage with tailoring for their bodies \u2014 for different body types, for different genders \u2014 and then how black expression also comes through in a very potent, polished way.\u201d",

      "In February, the Council of Fashion Designers of America published a story about Black dandyism that highlighted some current day examples, including co-chair Colman Domingo and Met Gala host committee member Andr\u00e9 3000.",
      "The not-for-profit association, which includes over 450 American fashion and accessory designers as members, spoke to Darnell-Jamal Lisby, fashion historian and assistant curator of The Cleveland Museum of Art, about how Black dandyism separates itself from dandyism.",
      "\u201cBlack dandyism aligns with traditional dandyism but carries an organic self-expression that transcends societal norms,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the African American context, it began with respectability in politics before evolving into a revolutionary statement. Figures like Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois used refined imagery to challenge racist narratives. By the 1920s, Black men reinterpreted Eurocentric fashion through their own lens, blending respectability with rebellion, a dynamic that continues to shape Black menswear today.\u201d",
      "Lisby mentioned zoot suits in particular, which feature high-waisted, billowy pants.",
      "\u201cInitially, they were not a political act, but became one when mainstream society criminalized the look. Black men\u2019s bodies have long been policed, and deviating from white norms only heightened that scrutiny. Yet, they embraced the style as their own,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking about the eras of Black dandyism that he showcases in his personal style, Wellington shares in his TODAY.com interview that he dresses in the style and feel of the 1920s and \u201830s.",
      "\u201cA saying that I hold dear, and I sort of live is: Vintage style, not vintage values. What that means to me is that we have to look back, but we have to do so in order to move forward,\u201d he says about the celebration of Black dandyism.",
      "\u201cBlack dandyism is confidence. It\u2019s culture. Clothing is armor,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s taking clothing and using it as a way to fully express who you are. It\u2019s rare for a lot of people in their day to day life to feel like they are fully expressing themselves through clothing. It\u2019s intention\u2026and I look forward to it inspiring others to bring a little bit of that into their lives and to learn more about it.\u201d",
      "What are some examples of Black dandyism?",
      "In 2017, Paper Magazine spoke to author Shantrelle P. Lewis about her book \u201cDandy Lion: The Black Dandy and Street Style,\u201d which shines a light on designers, tailors and events that have shaped contemporary Black dandyism.",
      "After referencing how Miller\u2019s book chronicled the trajectory of Black dandyism, Lewis noted in the interview how Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. Du Bois were early examples of Black dandyism.",
      "\u201cI think in an earlier era, it was deeply rooted in respectability,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt then reflected scholastic rigor and self- respect \u2014 think Malcolm X and his sharp suits or James Baldwin.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cToday, dandyism is a more recent manifestation of hip hop culture. Black dandies are using hip hop methods of sampling to mix styles and articles of clothing from different eras and cultures to articulate statements of Black masculinity and individuality.\u201d",
      "What might some celebs wear at the 2025 Met Gala?",
      "Fashion fans should expect this year\u2019s 2025 Met Gala red carpet to be decorated with colorful menswear.",
      "One of the great things about this particular theme is that it\u2019s an opportunity for women and members of the LGBT community to embrace tailoring as they always have.\u201d",
      "Dandy Wellington",
      "As Lewis explained to Paper Magazine, color is reflected in dandy culture all over the world.",
      "\u201cWithin the Black community, color serves as a continuum of expressiveness and meaning present in the African aesthetic. You see pops of color that reflects the vibrancy of African Diasporan people internationally,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s loud, it\u2019s disruptive, it\u2019s flamboyant and filled with self respect and pride. It takes a lot of confidence to strut down the street dressed in a bright sky blue ankara fabric jacket. That color is often pleasurable for the wearer as it is for the observer.\u201d",
      "Wellington teases what else fashionistas should look out for while tuning into fashion's biggest night. \u201cWe\u2019ll see different interpretations of black tie and white tie, the formal versions of classic dress and traditional menswear,\u201d he tells TODAY.com.",
      "When it comes to his personal interests, the bandleader says he is most looking forward to seeing different types of hats. \u201cAs somebody who wears hats every day and feels like an outfit isn\u2019t complete without a hat, I\u2019m very excited to see classic millinery and inventive, dynamic millinery on display,\u201d he says.",
      "He also predicts there will be plenty of African prints to show a connection between continents and how Black culture reflects the African Diaspora.",
      "Wellington believes guests will go all out with their accessories, too.",
      "\u201cI am very excited to see how jewelry gets incorporated into these tailored looks. Double breasted waistcoats, dynamic lapels, some of the seaming, belt backs, box pleats and all kinds of things, that stuff is so core to tailoring.

      "For Diana Ross's Met Gala look, the drama is in the details.",
      "The singer commanded attention at the big event when she appeared in a crystal-embellished white gown and a feather-edged cape so long and broad it appeared to take up the entire width of the red carpet and took eight suited handlers to carry and present.",
      "Topping it all off was her signature voluminous tumble of curls beneath a broad, feathery hat.",
      "The former Supremes member explained that her cape includes a special detail.",
      "\"It has the names of all my children and my eight grandchildren,\" she explained. \"So everybody's name is embroidered, embroidered in that. And the hat \u2014 you know, like, I have to be careful with the hat because my head was pretty big.\"",
      "Diana Ross revealed that she wasn\u2019t planning to attend but that her son, 36-year-old Evan Ross, who appeared alongside her, persuaded her to take a break and attend despite being in the middle of a tour.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s the best thing of all time,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s the best thing. She is the Met Ball. She \u2014 you are the Met Ball, you are the moment.\u201d",
      "In addition to Evan Ross, Diana Ross is the mother of Rhonda Ross Kendrick, actor Tracee Ellis Ross, Chudney Ross and Ross Naess.",
      "\"I love that she has her children\u2019s names embroidered on her train, Diana Ross is the queen of main character energy,\" Kpoene Kofi-Bruce, a tailor and expert on dandyism and the historical era, tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"I also love how beautiful she looks in the simple sequined gown underneath.\"",
      "\"Diana Ross\u2019s look is so fabulous!\" \u00a0Kimberly Jenkins, the director and principal researcher of\u00a0The Fashion and Race Database, tells TODAY.com about the look. \"Aside from being a fashion icon, (Diana) Ross is also known for being in the film 'Mahogany' opposite Billy Dee Williams, which visually articulated the beauty of the black model in fashionable clothes.\"",
      "\"The color white is that when you were looking super fine and even in hip-hop tradition, super fresh, keeping everything white and clean was critical,\" Jenkins added. \"Even with the 1940s tennis star Althea Gibson, she went to great lengths to keep her tennis whites white. The ability to keep your whites white takes a great deal of labor, mindfulness, and stealth when carrying yourself.\""

      "\"Mrs. Harris looks elegant and timeless,\" Black fashion expert Kpoene Kofi-Bruce\u00a0tells TODAY.com of the former California attorney general's Met Gala look.",
      "\"It is a little bit of a departure from her usual preppy pantsuit, but the two-tone and the chocker are surprisingly sexy and sophisticated.\"",

It doesn\u2019t belong to whoever is in the White House. It belongs to you. It belongs to us. It belongs to We The People.\u201d"

      "Kimberly Jenkins, a cultural scholar, applauded the singer for wearing her beaded crown with intention.",

      "Around 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage into Gaza in the attacks, with more than 50 people, both dead and alive, believed to remain in Hamas' captivity, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The families of hostages who remain held in Gaza have warned that a ramped-up offensive will only put the lives of their loved ones at further risk.",
      "Meanwhile, right-wing ministers in Netanyahu\u2019s fragile government coalition celebrated the plans for an expanded offensive, having advocated for such a move before and after the last ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which held for two months from Jan. 19 to March 18.",
      "Prior to that ceasefire, the Israeli military had taken control of around a third of Gaza.",
      "Even so, hopes remained in Gaza and Israel for a resumption of that truce ahead of a visit from President Donald Trump to the region planned for next week.",
      "While Trump has repeatedly touted a proposal for the U.S. to eventually take ownership of the Gaza Strip, Palestinians there implored him to take action to halt Israel\u2019s plans for an expanded offensive.",
      "Khan Younis resident Abu Muhsin, 55, asked \u201cWhere is Trump who calls for freedom and democracy?\u201d",
      "In Israel, meanwhile, Cabinet Minister Ze\u2019ev Elkin said Monday that a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d remained for talks to resume.",
      "From outside of his Cabinet, Netanyahu has faced growing criticism for resuming and expanding Israel's offensive in Gaza. The latest denunciation came from Eran Duvdevani, a prominent retired colonel who led a campaign by former and reserve Israeli paratroopers calling for an end to the war.",
      "Duvdevani told NBC News that a growing number of reservists were already rejecting calls to return to service in a war they increasingly view as politically motivated.",
      "He added that without a fresh truce between Israel and Hamas, Trump's intervention was likely the only thing that could stop an expanded offensive.",
      "\"This is the only way, to press Netanyahu,\" Duvdevani said in a phone interview early Tuesday. \"Nothing will happen if Trump will not press him.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a hearing for\u00a0Netanyahu's testimony in his ongoing public corruption trial ended early Tuesday, according to Israeli newspaper\u00a0The Times of\u00a0Israel. It came as the Israeli military issued an evacuation warning for Yemen\u2019s Sanaa Airport ahead of what appeared to be a pending attack."

He added artificial white doves to the arrangement, saying they were in honor of the late Pope Francis, who had led a radical shift in the Catholic Church\u2019s treatment of LGBTQ people.",
      "\u201cPope Francis is a testament that God is alive,\u201d Concepcion, a devout Catholic who works as a street vendor, told NBC News. \u201cHe accepted everyone, including us gay people who have long been marginalized.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 death on April 21 has opened the eternal tension between choosing a successor that represents continuity, or one who will bring change, including a possible return to the church\u2019s recent past of more conservative positions on issues like homosexuality.",
      "Luis Antonio Tagle, a Filipino cardinal often dubbed the \u201cAsian Francis\u201d for his emphasis on poor and marginalized people, has emerged as a possible leading contender, or papabile, when the conclave meets on May 7 to elect Francis\u2019 replacement.",
      "If chosen as pope, Tagle could carry with him some lessons from the Philippines. Despite being the biggest Catholic nation in Asia \u2014 about 80% of Filipinos are Catholic \u2014 and the third-largest in the world, it is also one of the more LGBTQ-friendly countries in the region.",
      "Many gay Catholics, like Concepcion, remain active and visible members of the church, and he says Tagle offers the possibility of continuing Francis\u2019 embrace of gay Catholics into the next papacy.",
      "\u201cBeing gay is not wrong because we were also created by God and all things that God created are beautiful,\u201d Concepcion added.",
      "The Philippine Catholic Church has become more open to gay Catholics in recent years, including in a 2024 position paper in which the church acknowledged the LGBTQ community\u2019s \u201cimportant role in the life of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines.\u201d",
      "And while Tagle, who is known for avoiding provocative rhetoric and controversial issues, has rarely spoken publicly about homosexuality in his statements and homilies, he has lamented the church\u2019s \u201charsh words\u201d in the past about gay and divorced people. Filipino Catholics say they have felt supported by some of his actions and see them as potential signs of his approach to the community if he were to be elected pope.",
      "Edwin Valles, former president of Courage Philippines, an LGBTQ organization under the Archdiocese of Manila, says he is certain that Tagle would continue embracing the gay community.",
      "In 2014, Valles said he approached Tagle, then head of the Archdiocese of Manila, to request a priest to be assigned to guide their members, a request Tagle granted.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a commitment on his part,\u201d Valles said. \u201cHe puts money where his mouth is. So I like to think that he will also do the same if and when he becomes pope.\u201d",
      "Valles tells a story from a 2018 event they both attended, when a young faithful asked the cardinal about the status of LGBTQ Catholics.",
      "\u201cAnd his answer was something like: All of us are Catholics, all of us are parishioners, all of us are children of God. So why make that label and distinction? That just serves to separate or put people in boxes,\u201d Valles recalled Tagle saying.",
      "A man of the people",
      "The Jesuit-educated Tagle, 67, was born to a Filipino father and a Filipino Chinese mother who were both bankers, and Tagle grew up in a well-to-do family. He was ordained as a priest in 1982 at the age of 24, and like Francis, adopted a simple life.",
      "From 2001 to 2011, he served as the bishop of the Diocese of Imus, a city south of Manila, and his hometown. There, Tagle took to walking the streets, greeting street vendors and motorcycle taxi drivers. Residents affectionately recalled how Tagle would sit on a wooden bench outside a humble neighborhood barbershop, Bible in hand, his presence so regular that it earned Roland, the shopkeeper, the nickname, \u201cHoly Barber.\u201d",
      "Tagle then became Manila\u2019s archbishop in 2011 and was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. In 2015, he was elected president of Caritas Internationalis, the humanitarian and development organization of the Catholic Church, and was re-elected again in 2019. That year, he moved to the Vatican after Francis appointed him head of the Dicastery for Evangelization, the church\u2019s missionary arm.",
      "He would fly back to the Philippines, unannounced and without fanfare, to check on his ailing parents, have his hair cut by Roland, and make surprise visits to neighbors and relatives eager to receive a blessing from a cardinal back home from the Vatican.",
      "He \u2018does not possess a prophetic voice\u2019",
      "Tagle is highly respected in the Philippines, where he is widely perceived as \u201cwarm, gentle, approachable, humble and at times funny,\u201d just like Francis, Noel Asiones, an academic researcher from the University of Santo Tomas, a Catholic university in Manila, told NBC News.",
      "As a top cleric, Tagle\u2019s pastoral approach \u201creflects a leader eager to serve and emphasize meeting the needs of his flock,\u201d Asiones said.",
      "But the similarities seemed to end there. Unlike Francis, who spoke with forceful, moral authority on worldly issues like exploitative capitalism or the injustices of war, Asiones said, Tagle \u201clacks or does not possess a prophetic voice.\u201d",
      "Tagle has been criticized for his inaction on sexual abuse by priests, and his silence on the extrajudicial killings ordered by the Philippines\u2019 former President Rodrigo Duterte, in a crackdown on drugs that left tens of thousands, including children, dead. Duterte openly attacked and threatened the church, which in the Philippines has historically stood up against political power.",
      "In the face of the flagrant human rights abuses, however, Tagle responded with statements Duterte\u2019s opponents criticized as vague and unchallenging.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Tagle will be entirely Francis 2.0. For one, he opts for political correctness, often avoiding confrontational language, and seems reticent, if not afraid, to hold truth to power,\u201d Asiones said.",
      "A good theologian, but a poor administrator",
      "Tagle has had significant experience in the Vatican, but observers say it has been far from stellar.",
      "In 2022, Francis dismissed Tagle and the rest of the leadership team of Caritas Internationalis after a Vatican-led audit found \u201creal deficiencies\u201d in management and procedures.",
      "What the Roman Curia needs is a pope who is also a good administrator, said Charles Collins, managing editor of Crux, an international publication focusing on the Catholic Church.",
      "\u201cTagle is considered intelligent, a good theologian and a good communicator. But in many ways he has not been a very good administrator in some of the jobs he\u2019s had in the Vatican,\u201d Collins said. \u201cHe has not proven himself in that role.\u201d",
      "Francis had shaken things up in the Vatican and the cardinals may look to someone who could provide stability to replace him.",
      "\u201cI think the conclave is going to look at a European cardinal to become pope,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Three issues are expected to hound the next pope: clerical abuse, poor finances of the Vatican and the ongoing cultural war between progressives and conservatives.",
      "Tagle might be one of the more popular papabili, but Collins cautioned that in every conclave, \u201cthere are always people who are being promoted more in the media than among the cardinals.\u201d",
      "\u201cA pope from Asia or Africa is a good news story, but that does not reflect the views of the cardinal electors.\u201d",
      "Camille Elemia reported from Manila and Imus, Philippines."

      "But Ouellette said he was proud to have done the once unthinkable, voting for Liberal leader and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is projected to have secured a minority victory in this week's poll.",
      "Across social media, a number of once-dedicated Conservatives said that they would be casting their ballots for the Liberal Party this week for the first time in their lives. Many described their vote as a rejection of \"Canada's Trump\" \u2014 Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre \u2014 and his aggressive campaign, which experts say appeared to pull from the playbook of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThere were some elements of his campaign that echoed Trump,\u201d Roland Paris, director of the University of Ottawa\u2019s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, said Wednesday.",
      "That included talking \u201cabout eliminating wokeism\u201d and \u201creferring to his political opponents with nasty nicknames,\u201d Paris added. \u201cNone of these features of his campaign helped him once Trump came to be seen by many Canadians as an enemy of Canada.\u201d",
      "Just weeks ago, the pugnacious approach of Poilievre, who had previously allied himself with the so-called Freedom Convoy that protested vaccine mandates for truck drivers, appeared to be working.",

      "But within a matter of weeks, everything changed: Trudeau announced his resignation Jan. 6, while Trump swept back to power in the U.S., threatening to use economic pressure to annex Canada as the \u201c51st state,\u201d before imposing sweeping 25% tariffs on goods from America\u2019s northern neighbor and sparking outrage across the country.",
      "Trump's bellicose remarks gave a huge boost to Canadian nationalism, with many vowing to boycott the U.S. and its products.",

      "Abdel-Rahman al-Nour, a Port Sudan resident, said he woke up to strong explosions, and saw fires and plumes of black smoke rising over the port. Msha\u2019ashir Ahmed, a local journalist living in Port Sudan, said fires were still burning late Tuesday morning in the southern vicinity of the maritime port.",
      "The attack apparently disrupted air traffic at the airport, with Cairo airport data in neighboring Egypt showing that three Port Sudan-bound flights were canceled on Tuesday.",

Withing weeks, Port Sudan, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) to the east of Khartoum, turned into a safe haven for the displaced and those fleeing the war. Many aid missions and U.N. agencies moved their offices there.",
      "The attacks on Port Sudan are also seen as retaliation after the Sudanese military earlier this month struck the Nyala airport in South Darfur, which the paramilitary RSF has turned into a base and where it gets shipments of arms, including drones.",
      "The RSF is allied with the United Arab Emirates, which U.N. experts say has provided weapons, including drones to the paramilitary. The UAE denies the claim. Sudan\u2019s miliary is backed by Egypt.",
      "Sudan plunged into chaos in April 2023, when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open warfare in Khartoum. From there, the fighting spread to other parts of the country.",
      "Since then, at least 24,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher. The war has driven about 13 million people from their homes, including four million crossed into neighboring countries. It also pushed parts of the country into famine.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western Darfur region, according to the United Natios. and international rights groups."

      "About 1,300 members of the British armed forces were joined by troops from the United Kingdom\u2019s NATO allies and Ukraine \u2014 a nod to the present war in Europe. The procession started in Parliament Square and swept past Buckingham Palace, where King Charles III took the salute."

      "ISLAMABAD \u2014 Iran\u2019s foreign minister was in Pakistan on Monday to try and mediate in the escalation between Islamabad and New Delhi after last month\u2019s deadly attack on tourists in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir.",
      "Abbas Araghchi\u2019s visit was the first by a foreign dignitary since tensions flared in the wake of the April 22 massacre of 26 tourists, which India blames on Pakistan. Tehran has offered to help ease tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors.",
      "Pakistan\u2019s military has been on high alert after Cabinet Minister Attaullah Tarar cited credible intelligence indicating that India could attack. Pakistan has denied any role in the massacre of mostly Indian tourists, and offered to cooperate with a credible international investigation. India has so far not accepted the offer and several world leaders have urged both sides to exercise restraint and avoid further escalation.",
      "Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who was due to meet with Araghchi, welcomed mediation to defuse the tensions with India. Since last week, Dar said he had spoken to over a dozen foreign dignitaries, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.",
      "\u201cWe will not be the first to take any escalatory step,\u201d Dar said in Islamabad, but added that he had warned the international community that should there be \u201cany act of aggression by India, Pakistan will resolutely defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d",
      "He accused the Indian air force of attempting to breach Pakistani airspace on April 28. Pakistan scrambled aircraft and forced Indian jets to turn back, he said. There was no immediate comment from India on those claims.",
      "Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal wrote on X that Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and \u201cstrongly condemned the terror attack in Pahalgam.\u201d",
      "Kashmir is split between India and Pakistan and claimed by both in its entirety. The two countries have fought two of their three wars over the Himalayan region and their ties have been shaped by conflict, aggressive diplomacy and mutual suspicion, mostly due to their competing claims over Kashmir.",
      "The latest flare-up led the two countries to expel each other\u2019s diplomats and nationals as well as the shuttering of airspace.",
      "Dar also denounced last month\u2019s suspension of a water-sharing treaty by India.",
      "In the town of Akhnoor in Indian-controlled Kashmir, where the Chenab River flows into Pakistan, residents said Monday that water levels were so low that people could walk across the river.",
      "\u201cI have never seen this river dry in my life,\u201d said 55-year-old farmer Bal Krishan, adding he agreed with \u201cModi\u2019s decision to suspend the treaty and punish\u201d Pakistan.",
      "There was no immediate comment from officials.",
      "Also Monday, Pakistan\u2019s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar led a group of journalists to the mountain village of Bella Noor Shah, near Muzaffarabad \u2014 the main city in Pakistan-administered Kashmir \u2014 where he said New Delhi had falsely claimed the presence of a militant training camp.",
      "Residents of the village told reporters they had never seen any such camp in the area.",
      "\u201cIt is clear there is no truth to the Indian claim,\u201d Tarar said.",
      "Also Monday, Pakistan\u2019s military said it test-fired a short-range missile, the second such test launch after a medium-range missile on Saturday.",
      "The military said that the Fatah surface-to-surface missile has a range of 75 miles and was launched from an undisclosed location. Such missiles are never fired toward India, and usually end up reaching the Arabian Sea or the deserts of southern Balochistan province."

    "story": [
      "Australia\u2019s incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term in a close general election Saturday, local broadcasters projected, in a defeat for the\u00a0conservative coalition\u00a0that was undermined at the ballot box by its\u00a0association with President Donald Trump.",
      "The Labor Party pulled ahead of the\u00a0conservative Liberal-National coalition, led by Peter Dutton, with the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s early projections suggesting at least 70\u00a0of the 150 House seats for Labor, according to the Australian broadcaster ABC.",
      "\u201cNot the night we wanted,\u201d Dutton said at his party headquarters, adding that he had congratulated Albanese on his win.",
      "Independent candidates and minor parties are projected to take about 13 seats in parliament, which means Albanese may have to form a coalition if the final count shows that his party ultimately falls short of a parliamentary majority.",
      "Concerns among Australians over the soaring cost of living and the lack of affordable housing dominated the election at a time when interest rates remain high. Geopolitical relations with China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, were also front of mind for voters.",
      "But voters in this election were more concerned by Trump\u2019s shake-up of the global order with a new trade regime that slapped a 10% tariff on all Australian exports to the U.S.",
      "A survey published Wednesday by Australian think tank the Lowy Institute found that over 60% of Australians did not have any level of trust in the U.S. to act responsibly.",
      "Albanese, 62, rose to the top job in 2022, ending nine years of conservative rule. Spotlighting his working-class credentials, his party in this election promised\u00a0tax cuts,\u00a0help for young homebuyers, and a pledge of $5.5 billion more for health care.",
      "Until recently, the Australian leader\u00a0faced the prospect of becoming the country\u2019s first single-term prime minister in almost a century, bogged down by high inflation, a slowing economy, and a housing crisis put into sharp relief by Albanese\u2019s ill-timed purchase of a multimillion-dollar cliff-top home.",
      "After Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, Dutton, 54, who was leading the polls against his rival Albanese, saw a turnaround in popularity after many of his party\u2019s campaign promises, including on immigration, were seen as widely emulating Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).",
      "In the lead-up to the election, Liberal Party insiders told Reuters that the anti-Trump sentiment was spurring risk-averse voters to move away from Dutton at the ballot box.",
      "Trump had been \u201ca wrecking ball\u201d for Australia\u2019s conservative coalition, said Andrew Carswell, the former press secretary to Liberal Party Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who lost office in the previous\u00a0election, according to Reuters.",
      "Albanese, meanwhile, refrained from mentioning Trump on the campaign trail, instead telling voters on Monday, \u201cThe last thing you need is a volatile government.\u201d",
      "He has avoided direct criticism of the president in favor of a security alliance with the U.S., though he was notably absent from Trump\u2019s inauguration and has yet to visit Washington.",
      "A YouGov poll released on Thursday predicted a Labor majority, saying the party would likely win up to\u00a085 seats\u00a0in the 150-seat lower house, with the opposition facing a net loss of 11 seats, which would be its worst performance since 1946.",
      "Albanese\u2019s win comes after Canada\u2019s election earlier this week saw Prime Minister Mark Carney stage a major political comeback, fueled by a backlash against Trump\u2019s comments on making Canada the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Australia is one of a few countries where voting is compulsory for all citizens ages 18 years and older. Around 4.8 million of 18 million eligible voters began casting their votes as early as Thursday, with most postal votes expected to be counted after\u00a0election\u00a0day."

    "story": [
      "SINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore\u2019s long-ruling People\u2019s Action Party won another landslide in Saturday\u2019s general elections, extending its 66-year unbroken rule in a huge boost for Prime Minister Lawrence Wong who took power a year ago.",
      "The Election Department announced the PAP won 82 Parliamentary seats after vote counting ended. The party had earlier won five seats uncontested, giving it 87 out of a total 97 seats. The opposition Workers Party maintained its 10 seats.",
      "The PAP\u2019s popular vote rose to 65.6%, up from a near-record low of 61% in 2020 polls. Jubilant supporters of the PAP, which had ruled Singapore since 1959, gathered in stadiums waved flags and cheered in celebration.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful once again for your strong mandate. We will honor the trust you have given to us by working even harder for all of you,\u201d Wong said in a speech earlier to his constituency before the full results were out.",
      "Eugene Tan, a law professor at the Singapore Management University, said the opposition\u2019s failure to make further inroads after 2020 was a surprise. \u201cSingapore voters played their cards close to their chest. Today, they indicated that their trust is with a party that has delivered over the years,\u201d he said.",
      "A U.S.-trained economist who is also finance minister, Wong\u2019s appeal for a resounding mandate to steer trade-reliant Singapore through economic turbulence following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff hikes has hit home. The government has lowered its growth forecast and warned of a possible recession.",
      "Wong, 52, succeeded Lee Hsien Loong to become the city-state\u2019s fourth leader. Lee stepped down in May 2024 after two decades at the helm but remained in the Cabinet as a senior minister. His retirement as premier ended a family dynasty started by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u2019s first leader, who built the former colonial backwater into one of the world\u2019s richest nations during 31 years in office.",
      "The PAP is seen as a beacon of stability and prosperity, but tight government control and the rising cost of living in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities also has led to growing unhappiness, especially among younger voters. Widening income disparity, increasingly unaffordable housing, overcrowding and restrictions on free speech have loosened the PAP\u2019s grip on power.",
      "The opposition says giving it a stronger presence in Parliament will allow a more balanced political system and greater accountability. But they face an uphill task, often hamstrung by a lack of resources, fragmented support and a lack of unity. Critics said gerrymandering also gives the PAP an advantage.",
      "Pritam Singh, leader of the Workers Party, acknowledged it was a tough contest and vowed to continue the fight for a more balanced Parliament. \u201cThe slate is wiped clean, we start work again tomorrow, and we go again,\u201d he said.",
      "While the Workers Party failed to expand its presence, it had consolidated its support with increased share vote in some areas, said Southeast Asia political analyst Bridget Welsh. Other smaller opposition parties however, failed to make a breakthrough.",
      "Welsh said voters opted for stability amid concerns over global volatility due to sweeping U.S. tariffs. Wong\u2019s more approachable leadership in engaging younger voters and efforts to renew PAP by bringing in about a-third of new faces also helped swung votes, she said.",
      "\u201cI call this the Wong and Trump effect,\u201d she said. \u201cThe issue of economic insecurity really did reinforce his mandate.\u201d"

      "Some information about one of the two plots came to light early Sunday local time.",

She also called the ongoing investigation \u201cimmensely important.\u201d",
      "Iranian nationals in the past have targeted U.K.-based Iranians. In one case, an independent television network named Iran International \u2014\u00a0which broadcasts in Farsi and had been critical of the Iranian government \u2014\u00a0moved from London to the United States after its journalists received state-backed threats from Iran, the BBC reported in 2023.",
      "According to an ITV News investigation of that plot, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps planned to kill two journalists at the network using a people smuggler, whom they paid $200,000 to carry out the attack. The plan was ultimately foiled when the smuggler became a \u201cdouble agent\u201d for an unnamed Western intelligence agency, according to the investigation.",
      "In March 2024, another Iran International journalist was targeted and stabbed outside his London home, The Associated Press reported at the time. Two Romanian men were later charged in the attack.",
