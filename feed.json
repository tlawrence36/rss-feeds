      "MILAN -- Giorgio Armani\u2019s menswear collection for his signature brand that previewed Monday on the final day of Milan Fashion Week was all about catching the light, and the 90-year-old designer achieved that with shimmering textiles and a smattering of crystals.",
      "Armani closed four days of menswear previews for Fall-Winter 2025-26 at his historic headquarters on Via Borgonuovo, freeing the fashion crowd to head to Paris for the next round.",
      "Fans gathered behind barricades to snap photos of VIPs including Adrian Brodie, Joe Alwyn, Rocco Ritchie and Darren Star, arriving for the show under a light drizzle.",
      "Armani set the runway show deep inside the headquarters to a rhythmic almost club beat. Brimmed hats gave structure to the soft silhouette of wintery velvet and corduroy complemented by shimmering textiles that grabbed the light.",
      "Trousers were pleated, gathering slightly at the ankle, creating movement and allowing an easy tuck into laced boots. Jackets layered over zipped vests. Scarfs substituted for ties, sometimes big knits that converted to hoods. Faux fur collars, a trend in Milan this season, were used sparingly on outerwear.",
      "Jewel tones of ruby, emerald and sapphire brightened a neutral palette. Delicate crystal pins decorated evening wear lapels.",
      "A handful of women\u2019s looks emphasized the versatility of the menswear silhouette. The show closed with couples dressed for a festive evening, glistening with sequins and crystals for him and for her.",
      "Armani took a final bow wearing a blue velvet jacket, underlining his hallmark of comfort and elegance.",
      "Brimmed hats. Textiles that shimmer. Unstructured bags. Sporty zip vests for suits. Scarves with built in turtlenecks."

      "A teen charged with killing three girls and wounding 10 other people in a stabbing rampage at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England last summer is going on trial",
      "LONDON -- It was the first day of summer vacation and the little girls at the Hart Space, a sanctuary hidden behind a row of houses, were there to dance to the music of Taylor Swift.",
      "What was supposed to be a day of joy turned to terror and heartbreak when an intruder with a knife attacked the girls and their teacher on July 29 in the seaside town of Southport in northwest England.",

    "published": "Mon, 20 Jan 2025 02:42:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Carrie Underwood might not be Beyonc&eacute; or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem",
    "story": [
      "Carrie Underwood might not be Beyonc\u00e9 or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Carrie Underwood might not be Beyonc\u00e9 or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem. But the singer\u2019s participation in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration is nevertheless a sign of the changing tides, where mainstream entertainers, from Nelly to The Village People are more publicly and more enthusiastically associating with the new administration.",
      "Eight years ago, Trump reportedly struggled to enlist stars to be part of the swearing-in and the various glitzy balls that follow. The concurrent protest marches around the nation had more famous entertainers than the swearing-in, which stood in stark contrast to someone like Barack Obama, whose second inaugural ceremony had performances from Beyonc\u00e9, James Taylor and Kelly Clarkson and a series of starry onlookers.",
      "There were always some celebrity Trump supporters, like Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan, Jon Voight, Rosanne Barr, Mike Tyson, Sylvester Stallone and Dennis Rodman, to name a few. But Trump\u2019s victory this time around was decisive and while Hollywood may always skew largely liberal, the slate of names participating in his inauguration weekend events has improved.",
      "Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus, The Village People and Lee Greenwood all performed at a MAGA style rally Sunday. Those performing at inaugural balls include the rapper Nelly, country music band Rascal Flatts, country singer Jason Aldean and singer-songwriter Gavin DeGraw.",
      "\u201cThe people who are coming out and participating directly are still a small subset of the entire universe of what we call celebrity,\u201d said Robert Thompson, a professor of pop culture at Syracuse University. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing a lot more celebrities who are coming out and supporting Trump. There may not be that distinct division that we saw before.\u201d",
      "Even some who have publicly criticized Trump in the past seem to have changed course. One of the highest-profile examples is the rapper Snoop Dogg, who in a 2017 music video pretended to shoot a Trump lookalike, and then this weekend performed at a pre-Inaugural event called The Crypto Ball. When a social media user posted a video of his performance, his name quickly became a trending topic on social media with a fair amount of disbelief and outrage.",
      "There may still be a tinge of stigma, however. Thompson pointed to the statement from The Village People, in which they offered a justification for their involvement, which he likened to an apologia.",
      "Also, Thompson said, \u201cthe idea of being featured in a big national civic ritual perhaps can transcend political identity.\u201d",
      "The participation of people like Underwood is not going to change anyone\u2019s mind about Trump, Thompson said. It could, however, change minds about the artist. On social media, some declared they were going to delete Underwood\u2019s songs from their playlists.",
      "Where Trump once emphasized the otherness of a Hollywood that largely shunned him, he\u2019s now turned his attention back to the entertainment capital as a project to be saved. He named Stallone, Voight and Mel Gibson as his chosen \u201cambassadors\u201d for the mission. Thompson said it sounds like an Onion headline or something on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d That, or a logline for the latest installment in the \u201cExpendables\u201d franchise.",
      "Following the election, celebrity detractors have also been quieter than in 2017, when nationwide marches brought out the likes of Cher, Madonna, Katy Perry, Alicia Keys and Janelle Monae. The People\u2019s March in D.C. on Saturday did not boast about any celebrity participants. At the Golden Globe Awards in early January, Trump\u2019s name was not mentioned on stage -\u2013 a stark contrast to 2017, when Meryl Streep used her lifetime achievement award speech to decry the president-elect before his first term began.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve gone through these processes, and it turned out that none of it ever made any bit of difference,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAll of this celebrity talking against Trump and all of the celebrities going for (Joe) Biden and speaking about the future of democracy not only didn\u2019t make any difference toward the outcome of the election, but one could argue that it actually meant that things moved in the other direction.\u201d",
      "On Friday night in D.C., the nonpartisan nonprofit The Creative Coalition brought together some actors to raise money for and celebrate organizations that support military service members and their families.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of things that are nonpartisan, nonpolitical,\u201d said comedian Jeff Ross. \u201cI talk smack for a living and I\u2019m a big believer in free speech. The military protects my right.\u201d",
      "The entertainers stayed largely focused on the event at hand, not the incoming administration, although they did express concern about funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.",
      "\u201cThe NEA has always been in peril, regardless of what administration comes in. But it feels like the incoming administration will probably be more aggressive in cutting down funding for the arts,\u201d said actor Steven Weber. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s an essential component not only in our education, but in the life blood of this culture.\u201d",
      "One Monday event will have a bit of celebrity counterprogramming \u2014 the Concert for America, not as protest but as fundraiser for wildfire relief which will be held simultaneously in New York and Los Angeles and livestreamed to the world. Participants include Jon Cryer, Lisa Joyner, Conan O\u2019Brien, Julie Bowen, Adam Scott, Wayne Brady and Rosie Perez. In addition to performances and comedy, it will also highlight organizations dedicated to protecting human rights.",
      "Producers Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley Jackson started the event in 2017, also held on Inauguration Day, to raise money for organizations and non-profits they thought would need help over the next four years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not only to give people a call to action, but also to give them hope, inspiration and to feel connected,\u201d Jackson said.",
      "They didn\u2019t have trouble recruiting entertainers to participate, Jackson said. The only ones who declined did so because they were working.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a counter effort,\u201d Rudetsky said. \u201cI see it as a way to get rid of the annoying rhetoric and the hate that\u2019s based on nothing. It\u2019s about unity.\u201d"

      "A cutting-edge nighttime show at Disneyland Paris is heralding a bold new chapter for Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park",
      "CHESSY, France -- A cutting-edge nighttime show at Disneyland Paris is heralding a bold new chapter for Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park, as a raft of ambitious developments comes to fruition under a 2 billion euro ($2.05 billion) expansion plan.",
      "The overhaul includes the completed revamp of the luxury Disneyland Hotel, the upcoming renaming and doubling in size of Walt Disney Studios Park, and the much-anticipated arrival of The World of Frozen and a first-of-its-kind The Lion King land \u2014 cementing the resort\u2019s gains after the wilderness years for theme parks during the pandemic.",
      "Disney Tales of Magic was unveiled this month. It's a dazzling 20-minute spectacle blending drones, synchronized fountains, high-definition projections and ultra-bright lasers.",
      "\u201cFor the very first time, not only will we be projecting onto Sleeping Beauty\u2019s Castle, but also Main Street USA,\u201d said Tim Lutkin, artistic director of the production, referring to the park\u2019s main commercial artery lined with boutiques and merchandise.",
      "The show\u2019s standout feature \u2014 ultra-bright lasers \u2014 has been used only once before, at the Paris 2024 Olympics at the Eiffel Tower during the iconic opening ceremony that featured a performance with Celine Dion. The lasers, which travel 23 miles (37 kilometers), deliver extraordinary power while remaining safe near crowds.",
      "\u201cThe Paris Olympics used it first. But we saw it first,\u201d said Dana Harrel, executive entertainment director at Disneyland Paris.",
      "Featuring Disney and Pixar tales brought to life by drone-made 3D figures, synchronized fountains and a 100-piece orchestra, the show is elevated further by the original anthem \u201cLive in Magic.\u201d",
      "Audiences have been awestruck. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous. We\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful light show,\u201d said Sacha Tellier, a 33-year-old mother visiting with her family. \u201cIt gave me goosebumps,\u201d added Nathan Ruiz, a graphic designer from Madrid. \u201cThe combination of music, lights, and the drones felt like pure magic. I\u2019ve been to Disney before, but this show is on another level.\u201d",
      "The spectacle also reflects Disney\u2019s storytelling evolution. Lutkin noted the shift from classic ballgown tales to modern narratives like \u201cEncanto\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d which delves into deeper themes such as anxiety and depression. The latter\u2019s unexpected box office success, Lutkin said, proved that \u201cthe world and its relationship with Disney are ready to embrace more complex stories.\u201d This shift is mirrored in the show\u2019s selection of movies, spanning Disney\u2019s timeless classics and emotionally resonant modern hits.",
      "At the heart of Disneyland Paris\u2019 expansion is the transformation of Walt Disney Studios Park, doubling in size and reimagined as Disney Adventure World. Opening in spring 2025, a new park entrance, World Premiere, will greet visitors with the glamour of a Hollywood film premiere, leading them into immersive themed areas.",
      "\u201cThese projects reflect our commitment to innovation and storytelling,\u201d said Natacha Rafalski, head of Disneyland Paris, adding that they will further strengthen it as Europe\u2019s top tourist destination.",
      "Already Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park and France\u2019s top tourist attraction outdrawing the Louvre, Disneyland Paris welcomed over 10 million visitors in 2023.",
      "The expansion includes two eagerly awaited themed lands. The World of Frozen, debuting in 2026, will transport guests to Arendelle with a central lake hosting water performances and the Frozen Ever After boat ride, alongside themed dining, shopping, and accommodations. Meanwhile, The Lion King land will bring the Pride Lands to life with a log flume cascading from Pride Rock and encounters with beloved characters like Simba and Timon.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic delivered one the toughest challenges to Disneyland Paris, as with all resort parks around the world, forcing an eight-month closure in 2020 and another in 2021.",
      "But Disney doubled down.",
      "The ongoing \u20ac2 billion expansion is part of a $60 billion global investment announced in September 2023, aiming to redefine Disney parks, cruises and attractions over the next decade.",
      "A centerpiece of the Paris overhaul is the revamped Disneyland Hotel, with suites themed around classic Disney royalty.",
      "Disneyland Paris opened in 1992 under its original name, Euro Disney Resort. Situated just outside Paris in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, it marked Disney\u2019s first foray into Europe. However, the park\u2019s early years were fraught with challenges, including cultural missteps, financial struggles and lower-than-expected visitor numbers. Critics in France derided it as an American cultural invasion, dubbing it a \u201ccultural Chernobyl.\u201d",
      "To reverse its fortunes, the park underwent significant rebranding, changing its name to Disneyland Paris in 1994 to emphasize its French location and connection to the capital. Over time, strategic changes, including the addition of new attractions and a shift in marketing, helped the resort recover. It is now a cornerstone of Disney\u2019s global operations."

      "A$AP Rocky is about to go to trial on charges that he fired a gun at a former friend outside a Hollywood hotel in 2021",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A$AP Rocky is at a crossroads. He could soar to new heights of celebrity in 2025, or be brought back to earth quickly by a trial starting Tuesday that could led to his imprisonment for years.",
      "The hip-hop star, and longtime partner to Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons, is set to touch the highest levels of high fashion as one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May along with Pharrell Williams, LeBron James and others.",
      "And his modest acting career will get a major boost from starring alongside Denzel Washington in director Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\" planned for a summer release.",
      "But at the Los Angeles trial that's expected to last about three weeks, he is charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. He's accused of firing on a former friend on the streets near a Hollywood hotel in 2021. If convicted, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The 36-year-old has pleaded not guilty, and his attorney says he committed no crime.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready to go. It\u2019s been a long time,\u201d defense lawyer Joe Tacopina said after a hearing Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that\u2019s waiting over Rocky\u2019s head and Rihanna and their family\u2019s heads for a while. We\u2019re anxious to get this thing underway and get this behind him.\u201d",
      "The trial has its roots in high school in New York, when the Harlem-raised Rakim Mayers, now known as A$AP Rocky, met Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli, who will be the trial's most important witness.",
      "Ephron testified at a 2023 preliminary hearing that he brought Rocky into a crew of young creators who called themselves A$AP \u2014 for \u201cAlways Strive and Prosper.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had dreams, pretty much,\u201d Ephron said.",
      "He testified that the members remained close even as Rocky became rich and famous, but the relationships would eventually erode.",
      "The feud came to a head in Hollywood on the night of Nov. 6, 2021, when according to Ephron, Rocky fired at him three or four times, the shots grazing his knuckles.",
      "Ephron went to the police two days later, and brought shell casings he had picked up himself \u2014 both points the defense will seize on.",
      "\u201cYou need nothing more than Mr. Ephron\u2019s testimony by itself,\u201d Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec, the case's lead prosecutor, told a judge at the 2023 hearing,",
      "The trial is full of large personalities, along with two huge names that will loom over the proceedings despite having no direct role: President-elect Donald Trump and Rihanna.",
      "The trial begins the day after the second inauguration of Trump, whom Tacopina represented in the defamation and sexual abuse lawsuit of writer E. Jean Carroll. And Rocky himself became an unlikely cause celebre for then-President Trump during his first term when Trump publicly declared he was trying to get the rapper freed and returned to the U.S. when he was jailed after a brawl in Sweden in 2019.",
      "But Trump has no power over these proceedings, and could not pardon Rocky if he's convicted.",
      "Those anticipating the trial have long been asking whether Rihanna may attend.",
      "\u201cThe mother of his children is she going to be here?\u201d Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold asked the defense at an October hearing. \u201cShe\u2019s welcome to be here whenever she wants I\u2019d just like to know.\u201d",
      "Tacopina has been unable to give a definitive answer, but has said that he does not expect it.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very protective of Rihanna and doesn\u2019t want her anywhere near this proceeding,\" he said after Wednesday's hearing. \"But that\u2019s a family decision they\u2019ll make.\u201d",
      "Tacopina said he has no intention of bringing Rihanna's name up at trial, but Arnold suggested he may when screening jurors.",
      "The judge, a former sheriff\u2019s deputy, has an affable but no-nonsense style and dispenses with many court formalities. He said he will keep the juror selection process simple, and a jury should be seated quickly.",
      "In an uncommon move in LA County courts, he will allow cameras in court for nearly the entire trial.",
      "\u201cI believe that the public deserves to see what goes on in the courtroom,\u201d he said.",
      "Tacopina has also represented other hip-hop figures, including Meek Mill and YG. The lawyer who normally practices in New York is gregarious, quick with a joke and always happy to talk to the media, but can be ruthless in cross-examination.",
      "When discussing Ephron's minor injuries at the 2023 hearing, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle he survived that shooting\u201d and was admonished for his tone.",
      "Deputy District Attorney John Lewin, best known for his successful murder prosecution of real estate scion Robert Durst, was a late addition to the prosecution team. He's also known for his aggressive cross-examination, including a relentless, weeks-long questioning of Durst.",
      "The case against Rocky will largely depend on how credible the jurors find Ephron.",
      "Police officers who searched the Hollywood sidewalk after a report of shots fired found no shell casings. Police recovered no fingerprints from the 9 mm casings Ephron brought them, and no 9 mm pistol was found when a search warrant was served on Rocky.",
      "Surveillance video captured parts of the incident. Prosecutors at the 2023 hearing showed a video still with a man in a hooded sweatshirt whose face is not visible holding what appears to be a gun, along with another image showing the face of the man in the sweatshirt, with no gun visible. A detective testified that investigators established it was Rocky.",
      "Tacopina said he has not decided whether Rocky will testify, which he is legally allowed to avoid.",
      "\u201cHe is eager to tell his story, he would love the opportunity to do so,\u201d the lawyer said Wednesday. \u201cHe is very articulate and very intelligent, he\u2019s a good human being, that would come out if he testifies, but that decision has not been made yet. It depends on how the case goes.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe whole group that said he would never be there then turned into, he\u2019s not going to stay there. It\u2019s just a never-ending, merry-go-round of people trying to come up with the next narrative,\u201d Zager said in a phone interview with The Associated Press on Friday. \u201cTom has done nothing but be engaged with us every time he\u2019s asked about broadcasting. When he was retired and getting in, getting ready, he talked about how excited he was for it, that he was 100% and has never wavered on that. So the fact that there are people on that crew that have to read articles and narratives and predictions that Tom isn\u2019t engaged does wear on you,\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s comments by Zager are the first about Brady by someone from Fox Sports. Brady has not been made available for media interviews this season. He has discussed his first season in the booth during appearances on Colin Cowherd\u2019s show on FS1.",
      "On Thursday, Don Yee, Brady\u2019s agent, told Sports Business Journal that Brady \u201chas had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he\u2019s really excited about the future with Fox.\u201d Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox in May 2022 while still playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He retired after that season and decided in February 2023 to take a year off before moving into the booth.",
      "\u201cTom has had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he\u2019s excited about the future with Fox and his growth on their team,\u201d Yee said. \u201cAnd this year was the first year of a long relationship.\u201d",
      "Yee did not return an email or text message by The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Fox Sports has tried to weather the rumors and criticism surrounding Brady\u2019s future and his dual roles as the analyst on its NFL crew and being a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders.",
      "Everything has come to a head this week with Brady and Kevin Burkhardt calling Saturday night\u2019s NFC divisional round game in Detroit between the Lions and the Washington Commanders.",
      "Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn are candidates for the Raiders' head coach opening. Brady is involved in the franchise\u2019s coach and general manager selection.",
      "Brady cannot participate in Fox\u2019s production meetings with teams \u2014 either in person or via Zoom \u2014 watch practices, or step foot in a team\u2019s training complex. The only team complex Brady is allowed in is the Raiders.",
      "The league put those parameters in place going into the season after Brady purchased a 5% stake in the Raiders in May 2023. NFL owners approved the purchase last October.",
      "Zager said any inferences about a potential conflict of interest between Brady calling the game and being part of the Raiders\u2019 decision-making process are unfounded.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s questioning his professionalism and integrity. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Zager said.",
      "Any questions Brady would have for the coordinators or head coach Dan Campbell could be asked by Burkhardt or a member of the Fox crew in the production meetings. However, Brady receives the same film and statistical information as everyone else on the crew.",
      "\u201cAnytime you\u2019re around crew members and doing something as a crew, that\u2019s a good thing for the crew. So, we\u2019ve have to overcome that. You\u2019re not going to have that time to bond,\u201d Zager said. \u201cBut when it comes to analyzing the game and learning information, what is available at the fingertips of the average fan now is probably light years ahead of what was available even to the broadcast crew 15-20 years ago. Not being in the meetings has not stopped him from growing as an analyst throughout the season.\u201d",
      "Brady\u2019s analysis of teams and officiating is subject to more scrutiny by the league because of his stake in the Raiders, but it would have to be egregiously critical or call into question the integrity of a team or referee.",
      "Zager pointed out that Brady has been critical of play calls or strategy, just like any analyst is expected to do.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been awesome to watch Tom jump into this, having no broadcast experience, and calling the NFL\u2019s biggest games. He continues to find his rhythm and those spots where he can really shine during a game,\u201d Zager said. \u201cI think he\u2019s hitting a great stride as we head to the postseason in our biggest games. And I\u2019m looking forward to these next three games, which are three biggest games, and what he\u2019s going to add to the broadcast.\u201d",
      "Attention and rumors about Fox\u2019s top NFL crew are nothing new. Troy Aikman and Joe Buck\u2019s future during the 2021 season was constant fodder before both moved to ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d When Brady would join Fox then dominated the 2022 and \u201923 seasons. Brady, though, did take a lot of pressure off the network before Super Bowl 57 in 2023 when he said early in the week leading up to the game that he wouldn\u2019t be joining Fox in 2023, which allowed Greg Olsen to answer questions about the game instead of his future and not be a one-year, lame duck analyst on a top network team."

      "\u201cWe have here perhaps the largest thermal complex in a private house in Pompeii,\u201d said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Pompeii archaeological park. \u201cThe members of the ruling class of Pompeii set up enormous spaces in their homes to host banquets.",

      "\u201cThere is room for about 30 people who could do the whole routine, and that could also be done in public baths. So there is the calidarium, a very warm environment and also a large tub with cold water,\u201d he said.",

      "The suit filed in federal court in New York by Baldoni and production company Wayfarer Studios seeks at least $400 million for damages that include lost future income. It alleges that Lively and Reynolds hijacked the production and marketing of \u201cIt Ends With Us\" and manipulated media to smear Baldoni and others on the production with false allegations of sexual and other harassment.",
      "\u201cThis is a case about two of the most powerful stars in the world deploying their enormous power to steal an entire film right out of the hands of its director and production studio,\u201d the suit says. \u201cThen, when Lively and Reynolds\u2019 efforts failed to win them the acclaim they believed they so richly deserved, they turned their fury on their chosen scapegoat.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit comes about two weeks after Lively sued Baldoni and several others tied to the film, alleging they retaliated against her for coming forward about her treatment on the set. That lawsuit came just hours after Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel, alleging the paper worked with Lively to smear him.",
      "An email sent to publicist Leslie Sloane \u2014 who is also named as a defendant \u2014 seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "The Times said it stood by its reporting and planned to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the allegations.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d based on the bestselling 2016 novel by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and exceeded box office expectations with a $50 million debut. It begins as a standard romantic drama before taking a dark turn into domestic violence.",
      "The film's release was shrouded by speculation over discord between co-stars Lively and Baldoni, and the fallout has made make major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "\u201cHeartbreakingly, a film that Baldoni envisioned years ago would honor the survivors of domestic violence by telling their story, with the lofty goal of making a positive impact in the world, has now been overshadowed beyond recognition solely as a result of Lively\u2019s actions and cruelty,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Allegations from Lively that she was shown pornography and subjected to unwanted discussions about it from Baldoni and a producer were utterly false, the suit alleges.",
      "\u201cLively was so close and comfortable with Baldoni that she freely breast-fed in front of him during meetings,\u201d the suit says.",
      "She would later take moments like these that she encouraged and recast them as sexual harassment and misconduct from Baldoni, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It also says that counter to Lively's allegations, every request she made for an intimacy coordinator to help with sensitive scenes on the film was honored. It focuses especially on a a birthing scene, saying Lively's contention that she was \u201cmostly nude\u201d with non-essential people present including the film's financier were \"knowingly false.\"",
      "\u201cLively was wearing black briefs and a pregnancy suit that covered her midsection, and her top was covered by a hospital gown,\u201d the suit says.",
      "Baldoni says that at another point during the production, because he has back problems, he privately and politely asked Lively her weight so that he could work with his personal trainer to be able to safely lift her in the film.",
      "Reynolds later \u201cswore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife,\" the suit says.",
      "\u201cIn fact, Lively had earlier expressed insecurity about her postpartum figure, and Baldoni made every attempt to genuinely reassure her,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took center stage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Baldoni says the \u201ctone-deaf\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d moves from Lively that led to her attempt at a counter-narrative included naming a drink at the post-premiere party \u201cRyle You Wait,\u201d after the character who engages in domestic violence.",
      "The backlash against Baldoni led to his being dropped by his agency WME, which also represents both Lively and Reynolds,",
      "The suit alleges Reynolds was responsible for this, saying that he approached a WME executive at the \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d premiere and \u201cexpressed his deep disdain for Baldoni, suggesting the agency was working with a \u2018sexual predator.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cLively knew full well that making those allegations would be a career death sentence for Plaintiffs, especially given that Baldoni has lived his private and public life as an impassioned advocate for gender equality and healthy masculinity,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's lawsuit says Lively's cruelty even extended to having her suit served on Baldoni and his co-defendants during the onset of the wildfires that have ravaged the Los Angeles area, saying that on a day when they were \"gathering their kids and pets, preparing 'go bags' and monitoring evacuation orders while fearing for their homes, Lively\u2014from the safety of her penthouse in New York\u2014 deployed process servers.\u201d",

While the Munich Olympics terrorist attack has been the subject of several previous films, including Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cMunich\u201d (2005) and the 1999 documentary \u201cOne Day in September,\u201d \u201cSeptember 5\u201d \u2013 a kind of combination of \u201cSpotlight\u201d and \u201cRear Window\u201d \u2013 keeps its focus entirely on the broadcast that culminated in Jim McKay\u2019s much-remembered announcement of the hostages' tragic end: \u201cThey\u2019re all gone.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a group of experienced or trained news journalists reporting on this crisis,\u201d says Swiss director Tim Fehlbaum, who wrote the screenplay with Moritz Binder. \u201cIt was a bunch of sports TV people. That offered an interesting opportunity to confront them with these questions, in an almost innocent way.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d what was on TV screens in 1972, like McKay\u2019s report, is likewise what's seen in the movie. Real archival footage is a co-star. But everyone inside the studio is played by a sterling ensemble, including Peter Sarsgaard (a veteran of another striking journalism movie, 2003\u2019s \u201cShattered Glass\u201d ) as \u201cWide World of Sports\u201d creator Roone Arledge and Ben Chaplin as producer Marvin Bader.",
      "But if there\u2019s a central figure in \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d it\u2019s Mason, a then-young ABC Sports producer thrown into covering one of the biggest news stories of the decade. It was likewise a leading-man chance for Magaro, the talented 41-year-old Ohio native whose sensitive performances in films like \u201cFirst Cow\u201d and \u201cPast Lives\u201d have made him a standout character actor.",
      "\u201cIn a lot of ways, that\u2019s what was the most intriguing part of the script for me,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can be an actor without feeling this competitive nature and need to seize opportunities when they\u2019re presented because there\u2019s not a lot them. I think it was the same for Geoff Mason at the time.\u201d",
      "Magaro\u2019s first time on a movie set was as an extra in \u201cMunich.\u201d Since then, though, he\u2019s grown as an actor through an ethic of hard work that he traces back to his family\u2019s immigrant, working-class roots.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m a 5-7 nebbishy white kid from Cleveland, Ohio,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cThis kind of journey doesn\u2019t happen to many of us. It\u2019s been a hard road at times and it\u2019s been a continuous climb. I never expected to get this far but I always had a drive in me to get better as an actor.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d Fehlbaum put a premium on authenticity. From museums and collectors he gathered the then-cutting edge video technology of the early 1970s and brought it up to working order. Walking onto the set, which with near-accuracy recreated the ABC control room, was \u201clike stepping onto a submarine everyday,\u201d says Magaro. (The U-boat-set 1981 film \u201cDas Boot\u201d was, appropriately, as inspiration for Fehlbaum.)",
      "The actors leaned into the same ethos. Magaro depended considerably on the anecdotes and advice of Mason who went on to have a decorated, decades-long career in television. With his help, Magaro sat in on CBS\u2019s Sunday NFL control room and games at Madison Square Garden to soak up the fast-paced atmosphere.",
      "\u201cGeoff told me that day there was no chance to think. Their singular goal was to stay on the air to keep the story going, to do their job as sports broadcasters,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cOnce the clock starts ticking, there\u2019s no chance to think.\u201d",
      "In chronicling the minute-by-minute drama of covering the Munich terrorist attack, \u201cSeptember 5\u201d sidesteps the political repercussions of one the most infamous chapters of Israeli-Palestinian relations. The film was in post-production when Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023. It first debuted at film festivals last fall while the Israeli war in Gaza continued.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, raising hopes that the 15-month conflict could be nearing an end. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said the agreement was still not complete.",
      "Yet \u201cSeptember 5\" strives to keep its focus on media, not politics.",
      "\u201cHas anything ever really changed? That conflict has been going on since 1948 when Israel was created,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cIt\u2019s a question, no matter what side you\u2019re on, you can ask yourself, even with the current situation: Is the media covering this the best way possible?\u201d",
      "Earlier foundational moments in the history of live news broadcasting stretch back to April 1949, when 3-year-old Kathy Fiscus fell down an abandoned well in San Marino, California. KTLA in Los Angeles televised more than 27 hours of the rescue effort live.",
      "Today's media landscape, populated by social media and digital platforms that are often riddled with misinformation in some ways makes the ethical questions wrestled over in \u201cSeptember 5\u201d seem almost quaint. But for Fehlbaum, it's less about what's changed than what hasn't.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve observed is that while technology changes a lot, the bigger ethical or moral questions are still the same,\u201d Fehlbaum says. \"For both those reporting on a crisis and us consuming news.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- Comedian and host Conan O'Brien was named the newest recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy on Thursday.",
      "O'Brien, 61, has carved out an improbable decadeslong career arc, moving from goofy television interloper to comedic elder statesman. Along the way, he survived one of the most public failures in the history of television on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d \u2014 only to launch a successful, and sustained, next act.",
      "His travel series \u201cConan O'Brien Must Go\u201d sparked popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. In March, O'Brien will host the Academy Awards three weeks before his own Mark Twain ceremony in Washington.",
      "Deborah Rutter, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in a statement called O'Brien \u201ca master of invention and reinvention, consistently pushing the envelope in search of new comedic heights.\"",
      "O\u2019Brien offered his own tongue-in-cheek assessment, saying in the Kennedy Center statement that he would be \u201cthe first winner of the Mark Twain Prize recognized not for humor, but for my work as a riverboat pilot.\u201d He will be honored on March 23 in a special ceremony in which he will receive a bronze bust of Twain, the iconic American writer and satirist whose real name was Samuel Clemens.",
      "Mark Twain recipients are honored with a night of testimonials and video tributes, often featuring previous award winners. The ceremony will stream on Netflix at a later date yet to be announced.",
      "O'Brien leaped into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993, when he was chosen to replace the legendary David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "Bringing a skittish, awkward energy that contrasted with Letterman's deadpan persona, O'Brien constantly made fun of his own gangly appearance and inappropriateness for the job. He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host.",
      "In 2009, O'Brien's career and persona took a turn. He became the man who publicly gained and lost his dream job while America watched.",
      "O'Brien was tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d despite public warnings from his own guests that Leno wasn't ready to cede the throne. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "The aftermath split the comedy world, with Leno cast as the villain and O'Brien as the victim who was set up to fail.",
      "In an emotional goodbye on his final \u201cTonight Show,\u201d O'Brien described himself as lucky and refused to sound bitter.",
      "\u201cEvery comedian dreams of hosting 'The Tonight Show,' and for seven months I got to do it,\" he said. \"I did it my way with people I love, and I don't regret one second.\u201d",
      "He ended with a sort of generational rallying cry.",
      "\u201cAll I ask is this one thing, particularly of young people that watch: Please do not be cynical,\u201d O'Brien said, his voice cracking. \u201cNobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get, but if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.\u201d",
      "O'Brien reemerged later in 2010 with a new talk show on the cable station TBS. Despite the channel's lower profile, the show ran for 11 years while he launched parallel ventures like the podcast \u201cConan O'Brien Needs a Friend\u201d and the travel show \u201cConan Without Borders,\u201d a precursor to his current show.",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett and Dave Chappelle. Bill Cosby, the 2009 recipient, had his Mark Twain Prize rescinded in 2019 amid multiple allegations of sexual assault."

      "Anyone coming to \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d will surely know that this domestic tranquility does not and cannot hold. It was about seven years into Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, which would last until 1985. And while the film suggests that there was a semblance of normalcy in their day to day, there are also ominous signs of change and oppression \u2014 reports of ambassadors being kidnapped on the news, and tense \u201crandom\u201d traffic stops that their eldest daughter endures one night. Some left-leaning citizens are making plans to leave, but the Paiva family is not in a terrible rush. They\u2019re even making plans to build a new home.",
      "So when three men in civilian clothes enter their home one afternoon and tell Rubens, a former left-leaning congressman, that he needs to come in for questioning, it happens with little incident. Everyone is on guard \u2014 they\u2019re not naive \u2014 but you sense that Eunice believes he will come back that night. Maybe even the next day. Rubens is calm changing into a collared shirt and tie and lying to his daughter that he is going into the office, even though it\u2019s a holiday. But he also savors this moment with her, perhaps because he knows he\u2019s likely to not return.",
      "The film is based on a memoir written by Paiva\u2019s son, Marcelo, but you don\u2019t need to know that to know that it is first and foremost a memory piece. It is deeply personal and imbued with the kind of tenderness that is extremely difficult to see or appreciate in the moment. And although it\u2019s certainly idealized and wistful, we accept any assumed white lies because we all wish that for ourselves: to truly recognize what we have before it\u2019s gone.",
      "This story is not about the abduction, however, or what may have happened to Rubens after that day. It\u2019s about how Eunice continues on, through uncertainty, absence and, ultimately, the loss of hope. Salles chooses to tell this story in a rather straightforward manner, which works well, allowing the compelling narrative and the talented actors to carry the audience through.",
      "At the heart of it is Torres, who has already won a Golden Globe for her performance and whose portrayal of Eunice is a true marvel. Mothers and wives often get the short shrift in movies like this, about Big Important Topics decided on by men, but Torres instills Eunice with a deep emotional and practical intelligence that\u2019s beautifully feminine, whether she\u2019s dealing with a misogynist banker, a dead dog in the street or the thugs surveilling her home. She\u2019s fascinating and resilient in a way that so many women are in times of historical strife but rarely celebrated for.",
      "In one particularly poignant scene, she and the kids are being photographed by a journalist hoping to tell their story. They smile together, as they did earlier in the film when Rubens was there. Now he\u2019s not, and the reporters are confused. They ask Eunice to try a more serious expression. She laughs, \u201cThey want us to look sad,\u201d and instructs her kids to keep smiling. It\u2019s a perfect encapsulation of the complex spirit of the movie. Political disappearances don\u2019t begin and end with the victim, or the toppling of a regime \u2014 they are generational traumas that live on in the survivors and alter everything in their wake.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in limited release Friday (expanding on Jan. 24), is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csmoking, drug use, brief nudity, some strong language, thematic content.\u201d Running time: 135 minutes. Three stars out of four."

    "story": [
      "Horror, not comedy, has been the go-to movie genre in recent years, but a movie like \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d starring Keke Palmer and, in her big-screen debut, SZA, is a good reminder of what we\u2019ve been missing",
      "Horror, not comedy, has been the go-to movie genre in recent years, but a movie like \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d starring Keke Palmer and, in her big-screen debut, SZA, is a good reminder of what we\u2019ve been missing.",
      "Creepy stuff and jump scares, we\u2019ve been told, have proved better suited for channeling our abiding contemporary dread. But the communal joys of big-screen comedy have, and always will, suit dark days as much as light ones, if not more so. \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d for instance, happens to arrive while Los Angeles, where the movie is set, has been decimated by wildfires. The Southern California skies, though, are crystal clear in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d In the opening moments, someone says, \u201cIt\u2019s always cooler on the West side.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d which had its premiere cancelled by the fires, is a welcome warm breeze for a movie landscape that has largely frozen out the comedy. There\u2019s one overwhelming reason for this: Keke Palmer.",
      "This is a buddy comedy, so it might seem unfair to single out one half of a duo. SZA, in her first feature, acquits herself well. But this is Palmer\u2019s show.",
      "Palmer plays Dreux, a Los Angeles waitress who, when her artist roommate Alyssa (SZA) gives their rent money to an untrustworthy boyfriend, Keshawn (Joshua David Neal), goes on a madcap, day-long odyssey to raise the money before they\u2019re evicted. This seemingly low-stakes premise is itself a kind of throwback to a more 1990s-flavored movie. The antic spirit of F. Gary Gray\u2019s \u201cFriday\u201d can be felt throughout \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d",
      "The tone here, courtesy of director Lawrence Lamont, producer Issa Rae and screenwriter Syreeta Singleton, is amiably realistic. Aside from a few cartoonish flourishes, \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is grounded in a working-class reality where every step toward upward mobility for Dreux and Alyssa is swiftly knocked backward.",
      "They live in a dilapidated apartment complex in the neighborhood of Baldwin Village, nicknamed the Jungles. When they\u2019re forced to raise $1,500 \u2014 a race complete with a ticking-clock countdown to eviction, and, as things develop, until \u201ccertain death\u201d \u2014 Dreux is also scheduled for the biggest job interview of her life, to become a franchise manager for the restaurant chain she\u2019s employed by.",
      "The satire of \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is mostly directed at the feeble opportunities afforded to those striving to break out of a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. When the roommates seek a loan, their payday center advertises a comical APR of 1,900.5%. (The agent, who takes great pleasure in their credit scores, is memorably played by Keyla Monterroso Mejia.)",
      "That\u2019s just one of the characters the two encounter in their pleasantly meandering journey to raise money via everything from blood donation to Air Jordans hung on power lines. Some of the characters along the way include Katt Williams, as a conscientious homeless man who warns against predatory lending; Vanessa Bell Calloway\u2019s stripper-turned-blood-bank-worker; a new white neighbor named Bethany (Maude Apatow); and Keshawn\u2019s new hook-up (Janelle James), who proves the movie\u2019s most regular villain, despite the looming presence of a fearsome gangster (Amin Joseph).",
      "Anyone familiar with Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d will recognize some of the hallmarks of that HBO series, namely the struggles of Black women trying to get a leg up in Los Angeles while also juggling romantic interests that might come from a wide range of backgrounds. Here, that\u2019s Dreux\u2019s crush, Maniac (Patrick Cage), who drives a Mercedes and who she suspects is a criminal.",
      "If all of this sounds somewhat low stakes (I failed to mention Lil Rel Howery as their prospective sneaker buyer), that\u2019s more of a pleasing feature than a bug in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d Besides, filling this movie with anything more \u2014 star cameos or broad comedy set pieces \u2014 would be a mistake. That would leave less room for the interplay between Palmer and SZA.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days\u201d hinges on central buddy comedy, which Lamont seems to recognize even in his feature directorial debut. SZA\u2019s uber-cool unsurprisingly transfers easily to the big screen; her performance is winning because it\u2019s so unforced.",
      "But it\u2019s a testament to Palmer\u2019s dynamism as a performer that \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d would work no matter where their day takes them. There\u2019s a freewheeling wit and ever-shifting subtlety to Palmer, who so enlivened Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cNope.\u201d Only a theatrical comedy can really showcase charisma like hers. For an actress who\u2019s hustled to get to this point, \u201cOne of Them\u201d days is perfect platform for Palmer, scrappy and unstoppable.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, sexual material and brief drug use. Running time: 97 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "A hip-hop superstar beef was cranked up another notch Wednesday when Drake sued Universal Music Group for defamation over rival Kendrick Lamar's diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges UMG \u2014 the parent record label for Drake and Lamar \u2014 published and promoted the track even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice. Lamar is not named in the suit.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard and two attempted break-ins at Drake\u2019s Toronto home, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand's value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year.",
      "\u201cThe lawsuit is not about the artist who created \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019\" the lawsuit says, referring to Lamar. \u201cIt is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d",
      "The suit later alleges, \u201cUMG did so because it understood that the Recording's inflammatory and shocking allegations were a gold mine.\u201d",
      "And, the suit claims, the music company has made large investments and used its connections to arrange for \u201cNot Like Us\u201d to be performed at next month's Super Bowl, where Lamar will be the halftime entertainment.",
      "The lawsuit, which is seeking a trial and an undisclosed amount of money for damages, also repeated allegations in other legal filings that UMG falsely pumped up the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on streaming services.",
      "The track is nominated for five Grammys, including record of the year and song of the year.",
      "UMG disputed the lawsuit's allegations in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cNot only are these claims untrue, but the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist \u2014 let alone Drake \u2014 is illogical,\" the company said. \u201cWe have invested massively in his music and our employees around the world have worked tirelessly for many years to help him achieve historic commercial and personal financial success.\u201d",
      "The company added: \u201cThroughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth \u2018rap battles\u2019 to express his feelings about other artists. He now seeks to weaponize the legal process to silence an artist\u2019s creative expression and to seek damages from UMG for distributing that artist\u2019s music. \u201d",
      "Representatives for Lamar did not respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner whose full name is Aubrey Drake Graham, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre\u2019s biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year.",
      "Drake's lawyers, from New York-based Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said the lawsuit seeks to hold UMG accountable for knowingly promoting false and defamatory allegations against him. They said the shooting and break-in attempts at Drake's home, and the online vitriol, prompted him to move his family out of the house, and that he fears for his and their safety.",
      "\u201cBeginning on May 4, 2024 and every day since, UMG has used its massive resources as the world\u2019s most powerful music company to elevate a dangerous and inflammatory message that was designed to assassinate Drake\u2019s character, and led to actual violence at Drake\u2019s doorstep,\u201d the law firm said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit reveals the human and business consequences to UMG\u2019s elevation of profits over the safety and well-being of its artists, and shines a light on the manipulation of artists and the public for corporate gain,\u201d it said."

      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",

It said they say fill legitimate prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved medications written by Drug Enforcement Administration-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",
      "The company said it is asking the court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacies and pharmacists and to protect against the government\u2019s attempt to enforce arbitrary \u201crules\u201d that do not appear in any law or regulation and never went through any official rulemaking process.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

      "\u201cIn addition to the thermal injury that comes from the heat and the flame and the fire, we also have an explosive nature to this with particles moving at very high speeds striking patients,\u201d Foster said at a news conference from Phoenix that was streamed online.",
      "The blast killed four people, including a 3-year-old boy, and injured about 20 others. The U.S. military flew six of the wounded to Arizona on Jan. 4 because Hawaii\u2019s lone burn unit didn't have enough capacity to care for all the victims.",
      "Medical staff hadn't realized the magnitude of the injuries from the flying particles until the patients had surgery. But Foster said this was to be expected.",
      "\u201cYou really have to get into the operating room and start operating on these people to really understand that. So it\u2019s not surprising that nobody picked up on this,\u201d Foster said.",
      "The traumatic injuries resulted in some unusual infections but Foster said this didn\u2019t catch caregivers off guard. Doctors at the center have seen these types of injuries in fireworks patients before and infections in burn patients are almost unavoidable, he said.",
      "The blast happened at a three-story home with a bottom-level carport in a Honolulu residential neighborhood.",

      "The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather. Another polar vortex disruption will stretch Arctic air across the top of the globe and make Donald Trump's second inauguration the coldest in 40 years, meteorologists said.",
      "After starting in the Rockies Thursday night, the cold will blast eastward and as far south as the upper Florida peninsula over several days. Up to 280 million Americans will have a day or two where it\u2019s colder than Anchorage, Alaska, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.",
      "\u201cThis would be one of the coldest outbreaks certainly of the past 10 years, 15 years,\u201d said winter weather expert Judah Cohen of Atmospheric Environmental Research. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling air out of Siberia. And, you know, that\u2019s consistent with these stretches because when the polar vortex stretches, the flow starts in Siberia and ends in the United States.\u201d",
      "It will arrive in Washington well before Trump's inauguration Monday outside the U.S. Capitol. The National Weather Service is predicting the temperature to be around 22 degrees (minus-6 Celsius) at noon during the swearing-in, the coldest since Ronald Reagan's second inauguration saw temperatures plunge to 7 degrees (minus-14 Celsius). Barack Obama 2009 swearing-in was 28 degrees (minus-2 Celsius).",
      "But that's not all because the wind is forecast to be 30 to 35 mph (48 to 56 kph).",
      "\u201cThe wind chills would be in the single digits for sure,\u201d the NWS' Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Zack Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be cold, blustery, basically right up the National Mall. And it can get pretty breezy on the mall there with the west-northwest wind right in the face.\u201d",
      "Washington could see single digits later and on Wednesday morning might get near zero, Maue said. There could be a record low broken in Baltimore, Taylor said. He said most of the records that will be broken in this cold outbreak are not likely to be overnight lows, but still chilly daytime highs.",
      "About 80 million people are likely to have subzero temperatures at some point, Maue said.",
      "\"The coldest will be Tuesday morning for the Lower 48 overall,\" Maue said. The average low that morning for the entire Lower 48 will be around 7 degrees (minus-14 degrees Celsius), he said.",
      "Maue said a stretch from Chicago to Indianapolis to Columbus, Ohio, to Pittsburgh will get the most brutal cold compared to their normal temperatures.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like a corridor of extreme cold, calm winds at night over snow cover. Temperatures could really drop like a rock there,\u201d Maue said.",
      "Freezes could go as far as the Gulf Coast and northern Florida, meteorologists said.",
      "Earlier this month, long-range forecasts hinted at worst-in-30-years type of cold for the year's first week, but those predictions eased as the cold outbreak got closer. It was cold, but not near record levels. This time, it\u2019s the opposite. Each day\u2019s computer models show it colder than the previous one, Maue said.",
      "There's some possibility of snow squalls here and there, but it's mostly just going to be cold, Taylor said \u2014 what Maue called a dry cold.",
      "As happened earlier this month, this cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole. That ring is being stretched south across North America like a rubber band, Cohen said.",
      "These stretching events are happening more often in the past decade or so, Cohen said. He and others have linked these polar vortex outbreaks to human-caused climate change and decreasing pressure and temperature differences between the Arctic and the rest of the globe.",
      "Those also trigger changes in the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that usually brings weather from west to east \u2014 that make cold air and weather systems plunge from north to south like a roller coaster.",
      "On the east side of that plunge is cold air and potentially record high pressure, Taylor and others said.",
      "On the west side, in southern California, is not only warmer air but also the extreme pressure differences that could goose the already high winds that are fanning fires around Los Angeles, meteorologists said.",
      "Get used to it. There's some debate among meteorologists about how long this extreme cold outbreak will last but below normal temperatures may stick around through the end of the month for much of the country, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who organized winter weather workshops at the American Meteorological Society's annual conference in New Orleans.",
      "And Cohen said long-range forecasts suggest the same polar vortex conditions could return in early February.",

      "Kemp's announcement came as President-elect Donald Trump returns to office and more state and federal officials consider Medicaid work requirements.",
      "Georgia is the only state that requires some people to work, study or volunteer to enroll in Medicaid, under the program Georgia Pathways. If the incoming Trump administration approves Kemp's plan, parents and guardians of kids up to age 6 in households at or below 100% of the federal poverty level could receive Medicaid without meeting those requirements.",
      "\u201cIn a growing state that needs more Georgians in the workforce than ever before, providing health insurance to a family or individual with young children may be the last piece they need to restart a career and be on the path for a brighter future,\u201d Kemp said.",

Kemp has championed Georgia Pathways as an alternative to expanding Medicaid for low-income adults. Enrollees have to complete 80 hours of work, volunteer activity, schooling or vocational rehabilitation a month to receive coverage. Kemp says the goal is to ease them into a job that provides private insurance.",
      "Georgia Pathways had a rough start. After its first year, the program had around 4,300 members, a sliver of those who are eligible. Health policy experts have called the program a \u201cfailure,\" saying the requirements are too burdensome a large number of struggling people.",
      "Opponents also say the program has wasted money. Nonprofit health policy research organization KFF reports the program has costed more than $40 million in state and federal tax dollars that have been spent mostly on administrative costs rather than medical care. Others complain about sign-up complications and the program's slow processing times.",
      "In a written statement, state Senate Democrats called the new plan \u201cdamage control\u201d for the Georgia Pathways program.",
      "\u201cThere are over half a million Georgians who need health insurance, and the governor\u2019s proposal falls well short of that, and we\u2019re leaving federal dollars on the table that would help close the coverage gap in Georgia,\" said Democratic state Sen. Jason Esteves, of Atlanta. \"Because of the governor\u2019s plan, we will continue to struggle to strengthen our healthcare system.\"",
      "Kemp has regularly doubled down on his commitment to Georgia Pathways.",
      "\u201cThe old system is not working,\u201d Kemp said Wednesday. \u201cAnd the other side, their only answer to any of this is they want government-run healthcare. And I am not in that boat.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirement plans in 13 states, but the Biden administration revoked these waivers in 2021. Georgia Pathways survived after a legal fight.",

      "Food and Drug Administration officials granted a 2022 petition filed by two dozen food safety and health advocates, who urged the agency to revoke authorization for the substance that gives some candies, snack cakes and maraschino cherries a bright red hue.",
      "The agency said it was taking the action as a \u201cmatter of law\u201d because some studies have found that the dye caused cancer in lab rats. Officials cited a statute known as the Delaney Clause, which requires FDA to ban any additive found to cause cancer in people or animals.",
      "The dye is known as erythrosine, FD&C Red No. 3 or Red 3. The ban removes it from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines, such as cough syrups.

      "\u201cThe FDA is taking action that will remove the authorization for the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods. \u201cEvidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No.3. Importantly, the way that FD&C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not occur in humans.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis is a welcome, but long overdue, action from the FDA: removing the unsustainable double standard in which Red 3 was banned from lipstick but permitted in candy,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, director of the group Center for Science in the Public Interest, which led the petition effort.",
      "It's not clear whether the ban will face legal challenges from food manufacturers because evidence hasn\u2019t determined that the dye causes cancer when consumed by humans. At a hearing in December, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf suggested that's a risk.",

      "The Biden administration is floating a long-awaited proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine levels",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal officials on Wednesday released a far-reaching proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine content, a goal long sought by antismoking advocates that is unlikely to go into effect anytime soon.",
      "The proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration comes in the final days of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, greatly reducing the likelihood that it will actually be enacted. President-elect Donald Trump and his health nominees have not commented on the measure, but a similar effort led by Trump\u2019s first FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, was sidelined during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s health secretary nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said little about how regulating tobacco fits into his plans to overhaul the government's approach to fighting chronic disease. Even if the effort goes ahead under Trump, tobacco companies like Reynolds American and Altria are almost certain to challenge it in court, delaying implementation.",
      "The FDA has spent years studying the issue and said Wednesday that reducing nicotine would help nearly 13 million current smokers quit cigarettes within one year. Roughly 48 million more young people would never take up the habit because cigarettes would essentially become nonaddictive, according to agency projections.",
      "Under the agency's plan, nicotine would be capped at levels that \u201ccould no longer create and sustain this addiction among people who smoke.\u201d The agency's 334-page analysis was posted online in the federal register Wednesday morning.",
      "Antismoking advocates overwhelmingly back the idea and urged Kennedy to help implement it, if he is confirmed.",
      "\u201cTobacco regulation is a huge part of reaching the goals he\u2019s outlined for reducing chronic disease and a really important part of the conversation we need to have in this country,\u201d said Chrissie Juliano of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents the heads of more than 30 metropolitan health departments",
      "Smoking causes more than 480,000 U.S. deaths each year due to cancer, heart disease, stroke and other smoking-related illnesses. Those conditions often take decades to develop and remain elevated today despite ongoing declines in smoking among adults and teenagers.",
      "The idea of limiting nicotine has its roots in sweeping powers given to the FDA by Congress in 2009 to regulate the tobacco industry. But the FDA\u2019s efforts on nicotine and a host of other tobacco measures \u2014 such as adding graphic warning labels to cigarette packs \u2014 have been hampered for years by tobacco industry lawsuits.",
      "Under the law, FDA regulators can regulate nicotine but they cannot remove it completely. The agency's ability to set a maximum nicotine threshold is unique worldwide and the attempt would represent a first in global efforts to reduce smoking-related deaths.",
      "Currently, there are no U.S. limits on nicotine, which occurs naturally in tobacco plants. There are several techniques for removing it, including chemical extraction and cross-breeding plants.",
      "The FDA formally announced it would begin work on the proposed rule in 2022 and regulators received thousands of public comments from tobacco companies, retailers, health experts and consumers.",
      "The latest FDA announcement comes as smoking in the U.S. continues to fall. Last year, the smoking rate hit another all-time low of just 1 in 9 adults saying they currently smoke.",
      "Low-nicotine cigarettes are not a new idea. Several companies, including Philip Morris, experimented with selling the products during the 1980s and 1990s, without much success. In 2019, the FDA authorized a cigarette that contains 95% less nicotine than standard cigarettes.",
      "The FDA has sponsored studies showing that when smokers switch to very low nicotine cigarettes they smoke less and are more likely to try quitting. That research is considered pivotal to establishing that smokers won\u2019t compensate by just smoking more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply. That was sometimes the case with \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d cigarettes marketed in decades past. Those products were subsequently banned as misleading.",

      "Who are the people still cautious about COVID-19? They include young caregivers of vulnerable relatives, people with chronic health conditions and families rallying around a loved one. In interviews with The Associated Press, they talked about how they manage the trade-offs and the toll of isolation on their mental health.",
      "Before the pandemic, Bazia Zebrowski, 61, of Newbury, Ohio, dined out, shopped for groceries and took her dog, Shadoh, to the park. When she felt well, she occasionally could get together with friends despite having myalgic encephalomyelitis, a condition formerly known as chronic fatigue syndrome that causes inflammation, immune system problems, fatigue and pain.",
      "Now she keeps close to home, venturing out only for medical appointments. Her husband does the shopping and wears a mask at his workplace.",
      "They have not had COVID-19 and hope their luck holds. Getting sick would be a disaster, she said, potentially triggering a relapse or superimposing long COVID-19 onto her illness.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself COVID cautious. I consider myself COVID competent,\u201d Zebrowski said. \u201cCautious would imply that I have an unreasonable fear of something. I do not have an unreasonable fear of this disease.\u201d",
      "What does Zebrowski miss about pre-pandemic times? \u201cI miss the illusion that people are willing to care for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHow hard is it to put a mask on? It rattles your faith in humankind \u2026 (you learn) how little the people in your life understood how sick you were to begin with.\u201d",
      "Trauma is part of the experience of having a chronic illness, said DePaul University psychologist Leonard Jason, who has studied myalgic encephalomyelitis for more than three decades.",
      "\u201cThen you're traumatized by the societal reaction to the illness,\" he said.",
      "Some people aren\u2019t sick themselves but are taking precautions to protect a family member. Steve Alejandro, 42, of Wentzville, Missouri, calls himself a COVID shielder.",
      "His wife, Ashley Alejandro, 44, also has myalgic encephalomyelitis. \u201cShe\u2019s got maybe four good hours a day,\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a thing in the world I wouldn\u2019t do to protect those four hours.\u201d",
      "Alejandro changed careers during the pandemic, leaving behind \u201cmy whole support system\u201d so he could sell vintage books online from home. His three children \u2014 now 20, 18 and 12 \u2014 never went back to in-person school after lockdowns ended and are continuing their learning at home.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve really come together,\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThis is a choice that can be made and you can win at it.\u201d",
      "In Miami, Kira Levin is the primary caregiver for her 98-year-old grandmother. She said the thought of getting COVID-19 and risking her grandmother\u2019s health is terrifying.",
      "So, at a July wedding, the 29-year-old was the only bridesmaid and attendee in a mask \u2014 an N95 layered with a pretty mask to match the bride\u2019s green color scheme.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t take off the mask for pictures and nobody asked me to,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd I felt incredibly grateful for that.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe have done everything we possibly could to maintain our mental health and our social life,\u201d said Jacqueline, who has an immune disease that makes her vulnerable to infections. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than being disabled and isolated. As someone who has been disabled and isolated, I don\u2019t want that isolation part.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline, 30, and her sister Alexa, 34, launched a dating app in 2022 for people who are disabled or chronically ill, though all are welcomed. Users can add a \u201cCOVID Cautious\u201d tag to their profiles to signal they\u2019re interested in meeting others who take precautions. The Child sisters say 10% of their 30,000 users add \u201cCOVID Cautious\u201d to their dating profiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a market that we didn\u2019t expect to target but we happily accept,\u201d Jacqueline said.",
      "Alexa said the precautions started as a way to protect Jacqueline, \u201cbut they\u2019re no longer about that.\u201d She\u2019s trying to avoid long COVID, a long-term disability.",
      "Tossing aside the threat of long COVID is hard to imagine for Yale University immunologist Akiko Iwasaki. Though people have been studying the virus since its emergence, she said scientists still don\u2019t know how pieces of the virus can stick around in the blood of some people for more than a year after they\u2019ve recovered from the illness.",
      "Iwasaki still wears masks indoors and stays up to date with vaccines.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t afford to get sick and become chronically ill,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that we really are in a position to be able to better understand the disease, to help millions of people.\u201d",
      "While Scarbro understands that others are ready to return to \u201cnormal,\u201d it\u2019s not that easy for her or her family. It's true for many others with chronic immune illnesses, said Jorey Berry, CEO of Immune Deficiency Foundation.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world is able to kind of go back to their regular lives, our community doesn\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d she said.",
      "Scarbro, her husband and children are constantly taking into account other people\u2019s COVID-19 safety practices.",
      "And as the world turns back to pre-COVID life, Scarbro's family is doing what they can to keep her healthy \u2014 but not in complete isolation.",
      "\u201cI feel very scared about the future,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that people are done, and I respect that, but it\u2019s only going to make it harder for me and my family to keep me safe.\u201d",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombian president Gustavo Petro warned on Monday that his nation\u2019s military will take offensive actions against the National Liberation Army after the rebels, known as the ELN, unleashed a wave of attacks in the country's northeast that left dozens of people killed and forced thousands to flee their homes.",
      "\u201cThe ELN has chosen the path of war, and that\u2019s what they will get,\u201d Petro wrote in a message on X, in which he accused the rebels of turning into a drug trafficking group and compared their methods to those of Pablo Escobar, the infamous cartel leader who bombed government buildings and murdered his enemies by hiring hundreds of hitmen.",
      "Petro, who was a member of a guerrilla group during his youth, initiated peace talks with the ELN in 2022, after promising in his presidential campaign that he could get the rebels to demobilize within three months of taking office.",
      "But talks have stalled over multiple disagreements about how the rebels would disarm and the kinds of economic reforms that the government would implement in exchange for their disarmament. The ELN has also criticized the government for staging separate negotiations with a breakout group in the country's southwest and angered officials by continuing to kidnap civilians and extort businesses.",
      "On Friday Petro suspended negotiations with the rebels after violence escalated in Catatumbo, a mountainous region that produces around 15% of Colombia's coca crop and is located along the border with Venezuela.",
      "The ELN, which has an estimated 6,000 fighters, reportedly attacked civilians it accused of being collaborators of a rival group, the FARC-EMC, taking people from their homes and shooting them in the streets, while in rural areas firefights broke out between members of both groups.",
      "In a statement issued on Monday ELN leader Antonio Garc\u00eda said that his organization does not intend to target civilians, but has been going after former rebel fighters who are now collaborating with the FARC-EMC.",
      "Over the weekend, however, thousands of people fled towns in the Catatumbo region, fearing for their lives, including community leaders who had been threatened by the ELN. Among those fleeing were former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, who demobilized in a 2016 peace deal with the government, and have now been targeted by the ELN.",
      "The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Colombia said Monday that the new wave of violence in Catatumbo has displaced 18,300 people, who are staying in shelters and hotels in the cities of Tibu, Oca\u00f1a and C\u00facuta, where officials have warned of a looming humanitarian crisis.",
      "The governor of the Norte de Santander Department, where the Catatumbo region is located, said this weekend that at least 80 people have been killed in the fighting that broke out last week.",
      "Sandra Tijaro said in an interview she fled her village on Friday after armed men showed up and told everyone to evacuate. She is now staying with her children at a shelter in Tibu.",
      "\u201cWe want the armed groups to think about the welfare of rural folks,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are hard-working people who end up carrying the burden of this conflict.\u201d",
      "The 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia led to the demobilization of 11,000 fighters. However it left a power vacuum in some rural areas that smaller rebel groups have tried to fill, with the government struggling to reduce violence against civilians.",

      "BANGKOK -- Myanmar\u2019s military government and a major ethnic rebel group in the country\u2019s northeast have signed a formal ceasefire agreement, mediator China said Monday.",
      "The ceasefire between the military and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), which seized large tracts of territory along the border with China, is the second such pact in little over a year and came into effect on Saturday. A previous pact in January last year was not honored by either side.",
      "The new ceasefire was brokered by China in mid-January, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing.",
      "China is the most important foreign ally of Myanmar\u2019s military rulers, who took power after ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. The takeover led to nationwide peaceful protests that escalated into civil war.",

      "A meeting between the two leaders in ethnically divided Cyprus has ended without an agreement",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A meeting between the two leaders in ethnically divided Cyprus ended without an agreement on Monday, with both sides failing to reach a decision on a deal aimed at building trust that included opening new crossing points across a U.N.-controlled buffer zone.",
      "Nicos Christodoulides, the country\u2019s Greek Cypriot president and Ersin Tatar, the leader of the breakaway Turkish Cypriots, said in a joint statement that they have instructed their representatives to continue talks and that they would meet \u201cin the coming days.\u201d",
      "The leaders met for nearly two hours at the official residence of Colin Stewart, the U.N. peacekeeping force\u2019s chief of mission in Cyprus, to hammer out an agreement on opening new crossing points at specific points along a 180-kilometer (120-mile) U.N.-controlled buffer zone that cuts across the island.",
      "But the leaders left the meeting without announcing any crossing point openings. They affirmed in the joint statement that they \u201cboth believe that opening of new crossing points is critical to promote people-to-people contacts, strengthen economic ties and build trust.\u201d",
      "The dispute appears to be over the location of the crossing points, which would be of mutual benefit. Christodoulides said after the meeting that Tatar rejected a specific crossing point location and \u201cwasn\u2019t ready\u201d to agree on a package of eight trust-building initiatives that included the setting up of joint committees on youth affairs, as well as a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.",
      "\u201cEverything depends on when the Turkish side is ready,\u201d Christodoulides said.",
      "There are eight such crossing points along the entire length of the buffer zone, enabling people from each side to cross daily \u2014 many, primarily Turkish Cypriots, to work \u2014 since the first such crossings opened in April 2003.",
      "But people on both sides want to see more such crossing points opened to ease and speed up their commutes across the dividing line that was cemented in 1974 when Turkey invaded a few days after a coup mounted by supporters of uniting the island with Greece.",
      "A Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence is recognized only by Turkey, which maintains more than 35,000 troops in the island\u2019s northern third.",
      "A crossing point deal would have given a much-needed boost to U.N. efforts to get formal talks on resolving the island\u2019s ethnic division up and running again after a seven-year hiatus. The United Nations will host Christodoulides and Tatar along with senior officials from the island\u2019s so-called guarantors \u2014 Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom \u2014 in Switzerland in March to figure out how to get negotiations back on track.",
      "But an insistence by Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots on ditching a U.N.-endorsed plan to reunify Cyprus as a federation made up of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot zones and demanding a two-state deal instead has dampened hopes of a peace deal.",
      "Greek Cypriots won\u2019t sign up to any deal that formally partitions the island, and they oppose any clause, as demanded by Turkey, to permanently station Turkish troops on the island and to grant military intervention rights to Ankara."

      "An Indian court has sentenced a police volunteer to life in prison after finding him guilty in the rape and killing of a trainee doctor last year",
      "NEW DELHI -- An Indian court on Monday sentenced a police volunteer to life in prison after finding him guilty in the rape and killing of a trainee doctor last year, a crime that sparked nationwide protests over inadequate safety for women and led to a speedy trial in the country\u2019s slow-moving justice system.",
      "Sanjay Roy, 33, who has consistently maintained his innocence, can appeal the judgment in a higher court.",
      "The killing of the 31-year-old physician while she was on duty at a hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the country. Police discovered the woman's bloodied body at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital\u2019s seminar hall last Aug. 9. An autopsy found she had been strangled and sexually assaulted.",
      "Federal police, who investigated the case, said the crime deserved the death penalty. Parents of the victim had also sought the death penalty for Roy and said they suspected more people were involved in the crime.",
      "The case was initially investigated by Kolkata police but later the court handed over the probe to federal investigators after state government officers were accused of mishandling the investigation.",
      "After the assault, doctors and medical students across India held protests and rallies demanding better security. Thousands of women also protested in the streets demanding swift justice for the victim.",
      "Roy was arrested a day after the crime, and arguments in the case began in November. The assault prompted India\u2019s Supreme Court to set up a national task force to suggest ways to enhance safety in government hospitals.",
      "Many crimes against women go unreported in India due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence, as well as a lack of faith in the police. Women\u2019s rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where communities sometimes shame victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing.",
      "In 2012, the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus galvanized massive protests across India. It inspired lawmakers to order harsher penalties for such crimes, as well as the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases. The government also introduced the death penalty for repeat offenders. Four men sentenced to death for the 2012 crime were hanged in 2020.",
      "The rape law amended in 2013 also criminalized stalking and voyeurism and lowered the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16.",
      "Activists say new sentencing requirements haven\u2019t deterred rapes and the number of recorded rape cases has increased. In 2022, police recorded 31,516 reports of rape \u2014 a 20% jump from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have signaled they will limit their attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships, just as a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip entered its second day Monday.",
      "The Houthis' announcement, made in an email sent to shippers and others on Sunday, likely won't be enough to encourage global firms to reenter the route that's crucial for cargo and energy shipments moving between Asia and Europe. Their attacks have halved traffic through the region, cutting deeply into revenues for Egypt, which runs the Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.",
      "The Houthis separately planned a military statement on Monday, likely about the decision.",
      "The Houthis made the announcement through their Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center, saying it was \u201cstopping sanctions\u201d on the other vessels it has previously targeted since November 2023.",
      "However, it left open resuming attacks against both the United States and the United Kingdom, which have launched airstrikes targeting the rebels over their seaborne assaults.",
      "\u201cIn the event of any aggression ... the sanctions will be reinstated against the aggressor state,\u201d the center said. \"You will be promptly informed of such measures should they be implemented.\"",
      "The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, after Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel's military offensive in Gaza has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up more than half the fatalities.",
      "The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels.",

      "China\u2019s decision to send Han, rather than its ambassador to Washington as is usual, appears to be a carefully calibrated signal that it is willing to improve relations with the U.S., while not leaving Xi exposed to criticism should ties worsen.",

There he caught the eye of senior leaders and was elevated to district-level governance before becoming the city's mayor and then party secretary, the city's highest position, following a financial scandal involving his predecessor. Xi had briefly held the position after the scandal, giving Han access to him before him became China's new leader.",
      "In 2017, Han reached the apex of Chinese political power, the party's seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and after serving one five-year term was given the position of vice president, a position Xi has imbued with new weight as adviser and envoy.",

      "On Sunday, Han met with U.S. Vice President-elect J.D. Vance and U.S. business leaders, including Elon Musk, in Washington on the eve of the inauguration.",

      "Poland says they\u2019re assisted by the Belarus security services and other \u201corganizers.\u201d They're mostly Ukrainians, perhaps fallen on hard times since fleeing the war. They can earn $500 for each person they help, border officials say.",
      "Border guards claim to be routinely attacked. One guard was killed last year and several injured.",
      "They say that migrants shoot slingshots, throw small explosives or rocks, or use pepper spray on guards. More than 400 incidents were recorded last year in this section of the border, with 307 people hospitalized.",
      "The deputy commander of the Podlaski border guard division, Col. Andrzej Stasiulewicz, said the migrants are hard to discourage. \u201cWarning shots don\u2019t work, so force is needed,\u201d he said. Reporters were shown video and photos purported to show migrants assailing the border.",
      "Stasiulewicz said their actions are \u201cvery unpredictable, and very precise and coordinated.\u201d",
      "Medical aid group Doctors Without Borders paints a different picture. The charity says it's treated more than 400 people since November 2022, \u201cmany of them stranded for weeks in uninhabitable forests and exposed to violent practices at the border.\u201d",
      "People suffered from exhaustion, hypothermia, dehydration and mental health issues. Last year, it noted \u201ca sharp increase in people carrying the scars of physical assaults, including bruises and dog bites.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s almost impossible to independently verify such reports. The area is off limits. NGOs and media must apply for a permit to enter. EU and international agencies that work with migrants are not invited either, although migrants are provided with their contact details should they want to complain.",
      "Stasiulewicz said those who force their way in \u201care sent back to Belarus, which is in line with our legal framework.\u201d",
      "The Norwegian Refugee Council, a migrant aid charity, has another take. It said that nearly 9,000 \u201cviolent pushbacks \u201d have been reported by NGOs in what it describes as \u201cEurope\u2019s death zone\u201d since 2021.",
      "Pushbacks \u2013 depriving someone who may be in fear for their safety of their right to apply for asylum \u2013 are illegal under international law.",
      "Polish Undersecretary of State Maciej Duszczyk rejects the pushback allegations. He prefers \"turnbacks.\u201d The rationale is that migrants are obliged to apply for asylum in good faith at open border points, not force their way in.",
      "The nearest place they can do that is in Terespol, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Po\u0142owce.",
      "As far as the Polish authorities are concerned, their methods are working. The number of people arriving in Po\u0142owce has dropped significantly. Around 670 people applied for asylum there last year, and none to mid-January. The Office for Foreigners was empty when reporters visited.",
      "To keep numbers down, the government intends to suspend asylum applications in times of crisis.",
      "A draft law winding its way through parliament would see the border shut for 60 days if Warsaw suspects that migrants are being \u201cweaponized\u201d \u2014 should they approach the border in large groups, try to intimidate Polish officers or damage border infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf anyone uses violence against the border guards, we close the border,\u201d Duszczyk said.",
      "Doctors Without Borders says this could have \u201cdramatic consequences.\u201d It\u2019s urged Poland \u201cto drastically change course of action\" and do all it can to protect migrants and refugees.",
      "But EU leaders signed off on Poland\u2019s actions at a summit last month. Countries on Europe\u2019s eastern flank received a greenlight to suspend the right to protection when they believe that Belarus and Russia are \u201c weaponizing\u201d migrants.",
      "Ultimately, security and migration policies are highly politicized. Tusk has been in power for more than a year but his party\u2019s candidate in a presidential election in May faces a strong challenge from a nationalist opponent.",
      "The EU shifted further right in June after elections to the European Parliament, with nationalists and populists shaking Europe\u2019s foundations, particularly in major powers France and Germany. Tusk believes that tough migration policy can win back voters.",
      "\u201cIf we do not want to hand over these matters to radicals, extremists, populists, we must find the right answers so that no one in the world doubts that democratic states are able to effectively defend themselves against illegal migration,\u201d he said on Friday.",
      "He described the \u201ctough protection\" of borders as a \"sacred duty.\u201d Poland\u2019s borders also make up the 27-nation EU\u2019s external frontier. For Tusk, his country\u2019s security is Europe\u2019s security. It's a similar argument made by Hungary's staunchly nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",

      "Billionaire's wealth has grown faster last year, and now the world can expect at least 5 trillionaires within a decade, even as the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990",
      "DAVOS, Switzerland -- Billionaires' wealth grew three times faster in 2024 than the year before, a top anti-poverty group reported on Monday as some of the world's political and financial elite prepared for an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Joe Biden last week of a \u201cdangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\u201d The group's sharp-edged report, titled \u201cTakers Not Makers,\u201d also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",
      "The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation \u2014 including his own \u2014 and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\u201d Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about one specific individual. It\u2019s the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\u201d he added.",
      "Like Biden\u2019s call for making billionaires \u201cbegin to pay their fair share\u201d through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam \u2014 a global advocacy group \u2014 called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \u201cdismantle the new aristocracy.\u201d",
      "The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay \u201cliving wages\u201d to workers.",
      "Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said.",
      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \u201cbarely changed\u201d since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes\u2019 Real-Time Billionaire List\u201d as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \u201cminted\u201d every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \u201ccrony connections,\u201d it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \u201cGlobal Risks Report,\u201d which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \u201csocietal polarization\u201d \u2014 a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",
      "As in past years, protesters calling for more economic equality, taxing the rich and pressing other demands took to the streets. Some blocked roads to Davos, snarling traffic in places and delaying trips for some attendees to the event, which runs through Friday."

      "The blast claimed so many victims because a crowd had gathered at the scene, including people taking pictures, bystanders, and others attempting to scoop gasoline, Isah said.",

      "Egeland, who has made several visits to Afghanistan since 2021, said: \u201cWe see one after the other peer organization cutting programming and staff in the last two years.

      "The independent Italian fashion brand Simon Cracker denounced the luxury fashion system with an upcycled collection previewed during Milan Fashion Week",
      "MILAN -- The independent Italian fashion brand Simon Cracker denounced the luxury fashion system with an upcycled collection previewed during Milan Fashion Week on Sunday that riffed on what they see as bygone days of quality and creativity.",
      "The coed looks created from recovered and deadstock garments, materials and accessories included a tongue-in-cheek swipe at Hermes\u2019 highly prized Birkin bag, with the designers drawing the telltale hardware on leather bags or screen-printing images of the coveted bag on sweaters.",
      "Co-creative directors Simone Botte and Filippo Biraghi were delighted that Walmart came out with what was widely seen as a Birkin knockoff while they were working on this collection.",
      "\u201cPeople have lost interest in fashion,'' Biraghi said. \"They have been taken for a ride for 20 years. And with 50 wars in the world, climate change, we all are getting poorer. There is no longer a connection between price and value. At a certain point, you can't go on.\u2019\u2019",
      "The collection pokes fun at the typical Milanese signora, known in dialect as sciura, sending her up with funky tweed separates, a foulard and even a tiny dog. Each silhouette is unique, constructed from garments the pair recover from dry cleaners and other sources, and models slide into character with insouciant slouches and exaggerated catwalk strides.",
      "The brand extended its collaboration with Doc Martens, decorated with trompe l\u2019oeil ballerina shoes. At times, skirts, collars and decorative fringe were fashioned out of shiny tinsel packing material, and ribbons covered shoes.",
      "The show closed with a garment completely concealed by luxury tags from Biraghi\u2019s own wardrobe collected over the years. \"We are making fun of wealth,'' he said.",
      "The Simon Cracker runway critique hits the sector when its down \u2014 and analysts say in need of reform.",
      "A new study by McKinsey consultancy and The Business of Fashion said that top brands are facing a significant slowdown this year, after a four-year period of exceptional growth from 2019-2023 that allowed the sector to grow by a compounded 5% a year despite the pandemic.",
      "Most of that expansion \u2014 a full 80% \u2014 was due to price increases that outpaced innovation, the McKinsey-Business of Fashion report said.",
      "The Bain consultancy similarly has forecast a contraction of 2% for 2025, the first since the Great Recession, not including the 2020 pandemic year. It cited a crisis in creativity along side global turbulence.",
      "The findings are of no surprise to Botte and Biraghi.",
      "\u201cIf a garment is not interesting, it it doesn\u2019t tell a story, if there is nothing creative, who cares,'' said Biraghi. \u201cWe all have lots of clothes, too many. We don\u2019t need more.\u201d",
      "Italian singer Chiara Galiazzo was in the front row dressed in a pinstripe and plaid jacket painted in sky blue and worn with royal blue Bermuda cutoffs and matching painted boots. She said she was drawn to the brand by its authenticity.",
      "\u201cI feel like I am part of a community,\u2019\u2019 she said after the show. \u201cI think this is something that is important, and a lot of fun.\u201d"

      "MILAN -- MILAN (AP) \u2014 Miuccia Prada and her co-creative director Raf Simons described the latest Prada menswear collaboration unveiled during Milan Fashion Week on Sunday as raw and cinematic.",
      "While the Milan Fall-Winter 2025-2026 runway was full of faux fur collars, Prada went the usual step beyond and created primitive detailing in shearling that looked almost torn from the beast and set askew on outerwear lapels, or patchworked into garments.",
      "\u201cMaybe, it reads as savage, primitive cavemen. I think that our aim was to make it feel warm and human and instinctive, but also kind of beautifully domestic in a way,\u201d Simons said backstage.",
      "Cinematic references were broad and not specific to any film, director or even character type, Simons said. Western touches included scuffed cowboy boots and knitwear mimicking a wrangler\u2019s shirt - without creating characters or caricatures.",
      "Feminine touches flourished. Men were invited to wear jewelry, such as bracelets with mini basketballs or baseballs. Chains with amulets hung from fine knits. Fake fur-lined hoods came in florals.",
      "The silhouette mixed skinny trousers, often in bright rock-and-roll satin, with more ample volumes like pajama tops or slightly ratty sweaters. Suits required no shirts, as the designers advocated instinctive dressing.",
      "One look seemed to distill the collection to its boyish essence: Straight leg jeans with a knit top featuring striped detailing, worn with floral-stamped cowboy boots.",
      "The designers said the collection was meant to offer hope in difficult times, proffering humanity as a form of resistance to whatever may be oppressing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of an answer to what of course is happening. We have to resist with our instinct, with our humanity, with our passion, with our romance,\u2019\u2019 Prada said backstage. Good work, she said, is also a form of resistance.",
      "The message contained in the collection \"has to be optimistic by definition and in principle,\u2019\u2019 Prada said.",
      "The ever-transforming showroom inside the Prada Foundation\u2019s Deposito contemporary art space was sheathed in Art Noveau carpet, and the runway was set on raised metal scaffolding. Simons said it represented contrasts, decoration and a work-in-progress.",
      "Suits require no shirts. Two puffers are better than one. Raw shearling collars let loose primitive instincts. Subtle jewelry and florals for men. Cowboy boots.",
      "Prada's front row hailed from across the globe and disciplines, including British actor and musician William Gao, arriving with British musician Olivia Hardy, U.S. actor Keith Powers, South Korean actress Kim Tae-ri, Chinese table tennis player Ma Long and British actor Louis Patridge. A crowd of fans waited just beyond a barricade to cheer them all."

      "A settlement has been reached by North Carolina's Insurance Department and the industry that sells homeowner policies",
      "RALEIGH. N.C. -- Base rates for North Carolina homeowners' insurance premiums will increase on average by about 15% by mid-2026 as part of a settlement reached by the state Insurance Department and the industry.",
      "The agreement announced Friday by Commissioner Mike Causey contrasts with the January 2024 request by the North Carolina Rate Bureau, which represents insurance companies, seeking a 42.2% overall average increase.",
      "Causey, an elected official who began his third term earlier this month, formally rejected the bureau's request last year. That led to a formal hearing that began in October and included multiple weeks of witnesses, evidence and arguments. The state Insurance Department said its witnesses would contend rates should be lowered or increased by less than 3%.",
      "Except for the settlement, a hearing officer \u2014 in consultation with Causey \u2014 would have decided what the new rates should be. The Rate Bureau could have appealed that decision in court.",
      "Causey said in a news release that the proposed rate increases \u201care sufficient to make sure that insurance companies, who have paid out large sums due to natural disasters and face increasing reinsurance costs due to national catastrophes, have adequate funds on hand to pay claims.\"",
      "The bureau attributed its large request to high inflation \u2014 particularly on building materials \u2014 combined with calamitous storms and \u201cseverely inadequate\u201d premium rates to cover claims. The bureau\u2019s requested increases had varied widely from just over 4% in parts of the mountains to over 99% in some beach areas.",
      "The agreed-upon increases, carried out in two parts, will vary based on location. On average statewide, the base rate will increase by 7.5% on June 1 and by another 7.5% on June 1, 2026.",
      "The highest increases generally will occur in parts of eastern North Carolina hit hard by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, The News & Observer of Raleigh reported. For example, beach areas from Carteret to Brunswick counties will see an average 16% increase in mid-2025 and an additional 15.9% in mid-2026.",
      "Areas harmed the most by historic flooding from Hurricane Helene in the fall will face lower-than-average increases. Base rates in Buncombe, Watauga and Yancey counties, for example, will increase by 4.4% in 2025 and 4.5% in mid-2026.",
      "Among highly populated areas, base rates in Raleigh and Durham will increase on average by 7.5% in each of the next two years. In Charlotte, rates would increase by 9.3% in 2025 and by 9.2 % in 2026.",
      "The settlement also bars the Rate Bureau from undertaking an effort to increase rates again before June 1, 2027, Causey's release said.",
      "Bureau Chief Operating Officer Jarred Chappell said separately that the settlement is \u201ca step in the right direction\" but that the bureau had asked for a larger increase \u201cbecause that\u2019s what recent claims data called for.\"",
      "\"Storms have gotten stronger and more damaging, more people are living in disaster-prone areas, inflation in the construction industry has been particularly high and reinsurance costs have exploded. All these cost drivers remain an issue,\u201d Chappell said in a written statement.",
      "North Carolina insurance law contains a \u201cconsent-to-rate\u201d exception that allows industry members to insure high-risk homeowners if they agree to pay premiums at rates that are up to 250% of the bureau\u2019s rate.",
      "While some insurers have pulled out of disaster-prone parts of North Carolina, the exception has helped prevent a mass exodus of home insurers from the state. About 40% of the state\u2019s homeowners\u2019 policies were set by consent-to-rate policies in 2022, The News & Observer reported."

      "DEERFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions in the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids, according to a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",
      "Walgreens, one of the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 locations, said in a statement that it stands behind its pharmacists. It said they say fill legitimate prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved medications written by Drug Enforcement Administration-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",
      "The company said it is asking the court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacies and pharmacists and to protect against the government\u2019s attempt to enforce arbitrary \u201crules\u201d that do not appear in any law or regulation and never went through any official rulemaking process.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

      "A fire at a one of the world\u2019s largest battery plants in California contained tens of thousands of lithium batteries that store power from renewable energy sources",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A fire at one of the world\u2019s largest battery plants in Northern California contained tens of thousands of lithium batteries that store power from renewable energy and have become a growing electricity source.",
      "By a long shot, California and Texas are opening more large-scale battery projects than anywhere else in the U.S., bolstering power reliability in two large states where extreme weather fueled by climate change has led to electricity shortages and blackouts.",
      "The fire that started Thursday at the Vistra Energy battery plant in Moss Landing, roughly 80 miles (about 130 kilometers) south of San Francisco, led to 1,700 people evacuating, closed part of Highway 1 and generated huge flames and significant amounts of smoke. The cause is under investigation.",
      "Experts say lithium batteries are a safe technology essential for lowering carbon emissions and making grids more reliable. Still, residents near the fire expressed concerns about the impact.",
      "In Texas, which is bracing for another blast of Artic winter weather next week, officials have credited batteries with helping stabilize the state\u2019s independent grid, which was pushed to the brink of collapse during a deadly winter storm in 2021.",
      "Here\u2019s how and why batteries are booming in the two states:",
      "Both Texas and California grapple with blackouts while trying to meet the energy needs of tens of millions of people as well as industry, including artificial intelligence and data centers.",
      "Batteries soak up excess wind and solar energy for later use. That backup supply helps the grid during times of high demand, such as during a heat wave, when air conditioning use is heavy.",
      "The cost of lithium batteries has dropped dramatically, boosting their popularity. For electric vehicle lithium batteries, as an example, prices fell by about 90% between 2008 to 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Vehicle Technologies Office.",
      "Cheaper lithium has made utility-scale batteries more cost-competitive than some natural gas alternatives. Batteries can also be switched on and discharge power in a matter of seconds.",
      "The Texas grid is rapidly gaining utility-scale batteries and added a whopping 5 gigawatts of storage over the last year, helping to keep up with demand and avoid blackouts.",
      "The 2021 blackout and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 have helped drive the expansion. Texas\u2019 deregulatory environment has also allowed wind and solar projects to develop quickly and easily, increasing the demand for batteries.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot less red tape that power plants have to go through in Texas,\u201d said Joshua Rhodes, an energy researcher at The University of Texas at Austin. \u201cTexas generally doesn\u2019t have any regulations that stop development.\u201d",
      "Some experts say the cheaper cost of batteries is fueling their rapid adoption more than anything, however.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much of a story of regulation as it is economic efficiency,\u201d said Jay Turner, professor of environmental science at Wellesley College. \u201cThe price of batteries and renewable generation has fallen so much that batteries and solar and wind, when put together, are so cost-competitive.\u201d",
      "The state has long pursued sustainable energy and in 2002 created a set of clean energy standards that the International Energy Agency considers one of the most ambitious in the nation.",
      "As solar and wind became increasingly popular, there were concerns that it would be extremely challenging to integrate that energy into the grid because of their intermittent nature.",
      "\u201cEven back in 2005, it was like any more than 15% renewables on the grid would be impossible,\u201d said Sally Benson, professor of energy science engineering at Stanford University. Last year California had more than 11 gigawatts of utility-scale storage on the grid.",
      "Part of California\u2019s motivation to act stems from electricity shortages. In 2020 the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) ordered rotating outages because the grid was overwhelmed with demand during a heat wave.",
      "Since then several gigawatts of battery storage has been added, a major reason CAISO hasn\u2019t ordered rotating outages in nearly four years, according to Denise Grab, an energy policy researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re really in uncharted territory here in terms of tech policy,\u201d said Sarak Kreps, the director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "Under the law, mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could pay up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties could total to a large sum.",
      "A lawyer representing TikTok told Supreme Court justices last week that the platform will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the law isn\u2019t struck down. But TikTok, which is not required to block its own platform under the statute, has not said whether it will limit access to the app, or its website, on Sunday. Experts have noted TikTok\u2019s app should remain available for current users, but existing ones will no longer be able to update it, making it unusable in the long term.",
      "Trump\u2019s national security adviser has signaled this week that the incoming administration may take steps to \u201ckeep TikTok from going dark,\u201d though what that looks like \u2014 and if any of those steps can withhold legal scrutiny \u2014 remains unclear.",
      "\u201cMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not-too-distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,\u201d Trump said Friday in a post on Truth Social after the court\u2019s ruling. Earlier in the day, he said in another post that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "In the meantime, some of the attention has turned to tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Oracle, who currently offer TikTok on their app stores or host company data on their servers.",
      "Tech CEOs have been attempting to forge friendlier ties with Trump, who wants to put the TikTok ban on hold, since he was elected in November. But Kreps said it would \u201cdefy credulity\u201d for them to continue to offer TikTok, even if they want to please Trump, since it would open them up to punitive fines.",
      "Tech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.",
      "\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d",
      "Apple, Google and Oracle did not respond to questions sent this week about their plans on TikTok.",
      "In a video after the court ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is expected to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration and be granted a prime seating location on the dais, thanked the president-elect for \u201chis commitment to work\u201d with TikTok to \u201cfind a solution\u201d that keeps the platform available.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform \u2014 one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\u201d Chew said.",
      "Earlier this week, TikTok told its U.S. employees that its offices would remain open for work even if the \u201csituation\u201d won\u2019t be resolved by Sunday. In the memo, which was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed by the company, TikTok told workers that their \u201cemployment, pay and benefits\u201d were secure, adding that the law was written in a way that impacts the U.S. user experience, not the entities that employ them.",
      "Meanwhile, in a letter sent Friday to Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, an attorney for TikTok creators who sued the government asked the administration to pause enforcement of the law \u201cuntil there is further definitive guidance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn addition, we request that you clarify that no app store, internet hosting service, or other provider faces any risk of enforcement or penalties with respect to TikTok, CapCut, or any other ByteDance apps, until such further guidance has been issued,\u201d said the letter by attorney Jeffrey Fisher."

      "A sale does not appear imminent, meaning the ban should go into effect Sunday. But the ruling also arrives just days before the inauguration of a new president.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said in a letter to IRS workers on Friday that he intends to step down from his position on President-elect Donald Trump's Inauguration Day.",
      "\u201cAfter significant introspection and consultation with others, I\u2019ve determined the best way to support a successful transition is to depart the IRS on January 20, 2025,\u201d Werfel said in a note addressed to all IRS employees. \u201cWhile leaving a job you love is never easy, I take comfort in knowing that the civil servant leaders and employees at the IRS are the exact right team to effectively steward this organization forward until a new IRS Commissioner is confirmed.\u201d",
      "Werfel's term was not scheduled to end until 2027. His early departure on Monday is unusual, since IRS commissioners' terms typically extend from one presidential administration into another. Werfel's term began in March 2023, under President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and was set to end in November 2027, under Trump, a Republican.",
      "However, Trump in December announced plans to nominate former Missouri congressman Billy Long, who worked as an auctioneer before serving six terms in the House, to serve as the next IRS commissioner.",
      "\"While I had always intended to complete my full term as Commissioner,\" Werfel said, \u201cthe President-elect has announced his plan to nominate a new IRS Commissioner. I have been touched by those who have reached out to me to share how they were hopeful that I could remain in seat and continue the important work underway. But as civil servants, we have a job to do, and that job is to now ensure a new Commissioner is set up for success.\u201d",
      "Democrats including Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon have called Long\u2019s nomination \u201ca bizarre choice.\u201d"

      "Once a skeptic who said a few years ago that bitcoin \u201c seems like a scam,\u201d Trump has embraced digital currencies with a convert\u2019s zeal.

      "The highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies as well as their use by criminals, scammers and rogue nations, has attracted plenty of critics, who say the digital currencies have limited utility and often are just Ponzi schemes.",
      "But crypto has so far defied naysayers and survived multiple prolonged price drops in its short lifespan. Wealthy players in the crypto industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump win last November\u2019s election. Bitcoin has surged in price since Trump's victory, topping $100,000 for the first time last month before briefly sliding down to about $90,000 earlier this week.

      "At last year\u2019s bitcoin conference, Trump told crypto supporters that new regulations \u201cwill be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry.\u201d Trump's pick to lead the SEC, Paul Atkins, has been a strong advocate for cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto investors and companies chafed as what they said was a hostile Biden administration that went overboard in unfair enforcement actions and accounting policies that have stifled innovation in the industry \u2014 particularly at the hands of outgoing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.",
      "\u201cAs far as general expectations from the Trump Administration, I think one of the best things to bet on is a tone change at the SEC,\u201d said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the executive director of the advocacy group Coin Center.",
      "Gensler, who is set to depart as Trump takes office, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg that he\u2019s proud of his office\u2019s actions to police the crypto industry, which he said is \u201crife with bad actors.\u201d",
      "Trump also promised that as president he\u2019ll make sure the U.S. government stockpiles bitcoin, much like it already does with gold.

The draft order calls for the Treasury Department to eventually hold at least $21 billion in bitcoin.",
      "Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming previously proposed legislation mandating the U.S. government stockpile bitcoin, which advocates said would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks. Critics say bitcoin\u2019s volatility make it a poor reserve.",
      "Creating such a stockpile would also be a \u201cgiant step in the direction of bitcoin becoming normalized, becoming legitimatized in the eyes of people who don\u2019t yet see it as legitimate,\u201d said Zack Shapiro, an attorney who is head of policy at the Bitcoin Policy Institute.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Few Democrats found ways to negotiate with Republicans quite like Shalanda Young \u2014 whose work as White House budget director stopped several potential economic crises from erupting.",
      "She brokered a 2023 deal to stop the government from defaulting on its debt. She worked to keep the government from shutting down, preserve disaster relief and address a baby formula shortage. She helped save aid to Ukraine with a loan based on frozen Russian assets.",
      "Young may have been the most powerful low-profile person in the Biden administration. And while President Joe Biden leaves office with a dismal approval rating and a mixed legacy, she departs as the director of the Office of Management and Budget with a record with more wins than losses.",
      "Her formula for success: a blend of understanding the arcana of federal spending, reading the politics of the moment, and convincing reluctant lawmakers that compromise was in their interest.",
      "\u201cShe was an enormous challenge to negotiate with because of her skills, her intelligence and her wicked sense of humor,\u201d said former Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry. \u201cI mean that as the highest of compliments.\u201d",
      "Sitting on a couch in her high-ceilinged office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Young attributed her success to \"giving Republicans who want to do the right thing the political space to do that.\u201d",
      "Now, the incoming Trump administration will face some of the same vexing issues: raising the debt limit, preparing a budget and figuring out how to extend roughly $4 trillion in tax cuts set to expire after this year while also taming a budget deficit expected to be $1.9 trillion.",
      "Trump has nominated his previous budget director Russell Vought to return to the post. With Republicans controlling the House and Senate, Vought won't necessarily need Young's nimble political skills. At his confirmation hearing Wednesday, he declined to say whether he would allow the remaining Ukraine aid to be spent in accordance with Congress' wishes.",
      "For their part, Democrats will no longer have Young as a deal broker. At 47, Young, whose judgment was honed by nearly 15 years as a House Appropriations Committee staffer, feels no need to sugarcoat the hard math.",
      "She figured out how to balance conflicting issues caused by the mix of challenging numbers and toxic partisanship. She also did it while juggling the challenge of being a single parent to her daughter, Charlie, 3 \u2014 meaning that her evening phone calls with lawmakers, cabinet officials and others often had the soundtrack of cooing and crying.",
      "\u201cTo talk to me is to know I have a child,\" Young said.",
      "She had decided to undergo in vitro fertilization treatments, believing that a woman could take the most high-powered of government jobs as well as handle the demanding work of parenthood.",
      "It meant a messy existence of little sleep, high-pressure phone calls and only four weeks of maternity leave.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a choice. I wanted the job and I wanted to at least have a shot at being a parent, and both had a high likelihood of failure,\u201d Young said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I chose chaos.\u201d",
      "The process of parenthood also changed her. She wondered how parents with fewer resources could make it, and concluded that people working 40 hours a week ought to be able to afford decent child care and health care.",
      "Young sees much of her approach stemming from how she grew up in Clinton, Louisiana, where her grandmother came out of retirement to be her middle school basketball coach. She stressed to her that she needed to live as a role model would: \"You don\u2019t know what young girl is watching you. So you are always to be on your best behavior. Be a leader of this team.\"",
      "That guided how she drives a deal. She let lawmakers, colleagues and even the president be human. When she negotiated on Ukraine funding, she thought about visiting that country as a congressional staffer and her trip to a child center there, where she played with the kids.",
      "When negotiations were faltering in 2023 to raise the debt ceiling, she worried about a growing number of Republicans who seemed to view default as an acceptable risk. But she says there is still enough of a governing majority who understood the threat to the nation and their constituents.",
      "The talks had become a circus on Capitol Hill, with reporters chasing the negotiators, so she moved negotiations to the Office of Management and Budget conference room with its relative privacy on the White House campus. She said she needed to get the right Republicans, such as McHenry, in the room.",
      "After agreeing on top-line numbers, Republicans said they needed to be able to go to their fellow lawmakers with work requirements on people who receive food aid. Young agreed to their terms, knowing some would lose benefits.",
      "To ultimately settle the deal, Young needed to bring Biden back from a foreign trip in Asia. At their final meeting on a May Friday, Young felt confident she had a deal. But she needed to fly to New Orleans to deliver a commencement speech at Xavier University. Her final phone calls ended at 3 a.m. and she then spent Saturday morning on the phone with Biden going over the deal.",
      "\u201cI'm glad I went,\u201d she said of the speech, but then added with laughter, \u201cThat weekend almost killed me.\u201d",
      "For her part, Young admitted she was most nervous to present the deal to Democratic lawmakers, scared that they might tear her head off for the resulting compromise.",
      "Instead, she got a standing ovation from the room.",
      "\u201cI cried like a baby,\u201d she said.",
      "Young has a position lined up for life after the White House, but it hasn't been announced yet. She said she's looking forward to the idea of living with just one cellphone."

      "During his first term, Trump frequently promoted his golf courses and routinely played at them with a large, taxpayer-funded entourage in tow, leading to criticism that he was using the power of the presidency to enrich himself. Trump pushed to host the international Group of Seven summit at the Doral property in 2019. But he dropped the plan amid accusations he would violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution that bans presidents from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments.",

The company hasn\u2019t disclosed how many users it has, so it\u2019s hard to know how broad Trump\u2019s reach there is.",
      "But what is clear is that Trump is the primary player in Trump Media & Technology Group, which started trading on the NASDAQ stock market in March.

      "China\u2019s population has fallen for the third straight year, pointing to further demographic challenges for the world\u2019s second most populous nation that is now facing both an aging population and an emerging shortage of working age people able to support...",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China's population fell last year for the third straight year, its government said Friday, pointing to further demographic challenges for the world's second most populous nation, which is now facing both an aging population and an emerging shortage of working age people.",
      "China's population stood at 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year.",
      "The figures announced by the government in Beijing follow trends worldwide, but especially in East Asia, where Japan, South Korea and other nations have seen their birth rates plummet. China three years ago joined Japan and most of Eastern Europe among other nations whose population is falling.",
      "The reasons are in many cases similar: Rising costs of living are causing young people to put off or rule out marriage and child birth while pursuing higher education and careers. While people are living longer, that's not enough to keep up with rate of new births.",
      "Countries such as China that allow very little immigration are especially at risk.",
      "China has long been among the world\u2019s most populous nations, enduring invasions, floods and other natural disasters to sustain a population that thrived on rice in the south and wheat in the north. Following the end of World War II and the Communist Party\u2019s rise to power in 1949, large families re-emerged and the population doubled in just three decades, even after tens of millions died in the Great Leap Forward that sought to revolutionize agriculture and industry and the Cultural Revolution that followed a few years later.",
      "After the end of the Cultural Revolution and leader Mao Zedong's death, Communist bureaucrats began to worry the country\u2019s population was outstripping its ability to feed itself and began implementing a draconian \u201cone child policy.\u201d Though it was never law, women had to apply for permission to have a child and violators could face forced late-term abortions and birth control procedures, massive fines and the prospect of their child being deprived an identification number, effectively making them non-citizens.",
      "Rural China, where the preference for male offspring was especially strong and two children were still ostensibly allowed, became the focus of government efforts, with women forced to present evidence they were menstruating and buildings emblazoned with slogans such as \u201chave fewer children, have better children.\"",
      "The government sought to stamp out selective abortion of female children, but with abortions legal and readily available, those operating illicit sonogram machines enjoyed a thriving business.",
      "That has been the biggest factor in China\u2019s lopsided sex ratio, with as many as millions more boys born for every 100 girls, raising the possibility of social instability among China\u2019s army of bachelors. Friday\u2019s report gave the sex imbalance as 104.34 men to every 100 women, though independent groups give the imbalance as considerably higher.",
      "More disturbing for the government was the drastically falling birthrate, with China\u2019s total population dropping for the first time in decades in 2023 and China being narrowly overtaken by India as the world\u2019s most populous nation in the same year. A rapidly aging population, declining workforce, lack of consumer markets and migration abroad are putting the system under severe pressure.",
      "While spending on the military and flashy infrastructure projects continues to rise, China\u2019s already frail social security system is teetering, with increasing numbers of Chinese refusing to pay into the underfunded pension system.",
      "Already, more than one-fifth of the population is aged 60 or over, with the official figure given as 310.3 million or 22% of the total population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 30%, sparking discussion of changes to the official retirement age, which one of the lowest in the world. With fewer students, some vacant schools and kindergartens are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Such developments are giving some credence to the aphorism that China, now the world\u2019s second largest economy but facing major headwinds, will \u201cgrow old before it grows rich.\u201d",
      "Government inducements including cash payouts for having up to three children and financial help with housing costs have had only temporary effects.",
      "Meanwhile, China continued its transition to an urban society, with 10 million more people moving to cities for an urbanization rate of 67%, up almost a percentage point from the previous year.",

    "story": [
      "China has reported that its economy expanded at a 5% annual pace in 2024, slower than the year before but still hitting Beijing\u2019s target of \u201caround 5%\u201d growth",
      "HONG KONG -- China's economy expanded at a 5% annual pace in 2024, slower than the year before but in line with Beijing\u2019s target of \u201caround 5%\u201d growth, thanks to strong exports and recent stimulus measures.",
      "The economy picked up speed in the last quarter, the government reported Friday, growing 5.4% in October-December.",
      "Exports have surged as companies and consumers rush to beat potential tariff hikes President-elect Donald Trump may impose on Chinese goods.",
      "\u201cThe national economy was generally stable with steady progress and new achievements were made in high-quality development,\u201d the report by the National Bureau of Statistics said. \"Particularly, with a package of incremental policies being timely rolled out, public confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,\u201d it said.",
      "Manufacturing was a strong engine for growth last year, with industrial output jumping 5.8% from a year earlier. Total retail sales of consumer goods grew 3.5% at an annual rate. Exports expanded 7.1% in annual terms, while imports grew 2.3%.",
      "The world\u2019s second largest economy has struggled with weaker consumer spending and resulting deflationary pressures as its recovery after the COVID 19 pandemic faltered and the property sector, once a main driver of business activity, fell into a downturn.",
      "The Chinese economy grew at a 5.2% annual rate in 2023, and economists have forecast that it will slow further in coming years.",
      "Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said that the economy regained some momentum last quarter thanks to recent policy easing.",
      "\u201cIncreased fiscal spending should continue to provide a near-term prop to activity,\u201d Huang said in a report. \u201cWe still expect growth to slow for 2025 as a whole, with Trump likely to follow through on his tariff threats soon and persistent structural imbalances still weighing on the economy.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s population also is aging and declining, adding to pressures on growth. The government reported Friday that the population fell for a third straight year in 2024, to 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year.",
      "With costs of living rising faster than wages, young Chinese are putting off or ruling out marriage and childbirth, accentuating the impact of birth control policies that once limited most families to one child each.",
      "Some economists say the economy is growing at a slower pace than shown in official estimates.",
      "\u201cThe precise achievement of the official growth target is highly dubious at a time when most indicators of economic activity and financial markets are flashing red,\u201d Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, said in an emailed comment.",
      "\u201cThe economy continues to be beset by a combination of weak domestic demand and persistent deflationary pressures, in addition to a hostile external environment that could limit exports,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump, who will be inaugurated next week, has pledged to increase U.S. import duties on Chinese goods. This week, the Biden administration also imposed further restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductors and technology, seeking to maintain the U.S. lead on advanced technologies and block China\u2019s access.",
      "The ruling Communist Party has rolled out a series of stimulus measures, including reducing banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratios, cutting interest rates and frontloading billions from its budget in 2025 to fund construction projects. It has ordered banks to lend to beleaguered property developers that were left mired in debt after authorities cracked down on excess borrowing.",
      "National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson Fu Linghui told reporters in Beijing that boosting consumption and expanding domestic demand are priorities this year.",
      "\u201cWith the coordinated efforts of stock policies and a package of incremental policies, the momentum of economic recovery is strengthening, the recovery of consumer demand has accelerated, and there are more favorable factors for a moderate rebound in prices,\u201d he said.",
      "Beijing has expanded a trade-in scheme for consumer goods and raised the wages of millions of government workers to revive domestic demand.",
      "Those incremental moves need to be accompanied by broader structural reforms, some economists say, that will improve productivity and make the economy less reliant on construction and export manufacturing. In particular, private businesses remain wary of boosting investment or hiring after years of policy shifts that have added to uncertainty over their role in the economy.",
      "Scant social safety nets, meanwhile, lead families to save rather than spend, and falling housing prices and weak stock prices have hurt household wealth, compounding the problem.",
      "\u201cChina needs a strong and multi-pronged policy package to revive growth momentum,\u201d Prasad said. Such a package would need to include substantial and well-targeted monetary and fiscal stimulus, complemented by reforms and other measures to revive private sector confidence.\""

      "The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won\u2019t...",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \u201cstamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\u201d while putting the new administration on notice.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to keep an eye on whether this administration decides to make a total U-turn and say, it\u2019s okay for children to be exploited in these dangerous industries and get injured and die and have their futures robbed,\u201d said Berkowitz, who is now a fellow at George Washington University focused on labor issues.",
      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it. Over the past fiscal year the department found more than 4,000 children in all industries employed in violation of federal child labor laws.",
      "That PSSI case got started after one 13-year-old suffered a serious chemical burn from the caustic chemicals used to clean the JBS plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, every night. But then investigators found more and more examples of PSSI employing children.",
      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor is determined to stop our nation\u2019s children from being endangered in jobs for which they should never be hired and to leverage our enforcement work to affect industries,\u201d said Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda.",
      "Some of the settlements included a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, that paid a $165,000 penalty following the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service LLC, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota,",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The Department didn't name the companies that own those plants",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate because investigators didn't provide details of the violations the company could verify. \u201cQSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\u201d he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\u201d",
      "Perdue was employing children at a Virginia plant using dangerous knives and other tools to slaughter chicken.",
      "The JBS agreement didn't include a finding that children were working directly for that company, but there have been examples at its plants.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor has made clear that too often, companies look the other way and claim that their staffing agency, or their subcontractor or supplier is responsible. But everyone has a responsibility to keep children \u2014 our most vulnerable workers \u2014 safe,\u201d the Department said.",
      "The Labor Department has more than 1,000 open child labor investigations it is pursuing. And every one of these settlements includes a set of standards for hiring practices that the Labor Department believes will help keep kids from getting hired.",
      "That includes steps like training all managers about how to spot underage applicants and avoid hiring them. False identification documents continue to be a problem. Companies are also expected to require all of their subcontractors to take precautions.",
      "Companies are also expected to set up hotlines where people can report any child labor concerns. And the Labor Department expects them to maintain accurate records of all their employees including their birth dates and work they do.",
      "And companies should discipline anyone who does hire children in violation of labor laws."

      "\u201cI considered it to be humor, which is consistent with most things I do,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHaving said that, I was made aware ... that the Djokovic camp was not happy at all with those comments. I immediately contacted the Djokovic camp and issued an apology to them. And as I stand here now, I stand by that apology to Novak.\u201d",
      "Jones also offered words to Serbians.",
      "\u201cI do feel as though I\u2019ve let down the Serbian fans,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not just saying this to try and wriggle out of trouble or anything. I genuinely feel for those fans.\u201d",
      "Serbia\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Rade Stefanovic, even got involved Monday, telling the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that Jones\u2019 comments were \u201cclearly unprofessional,\u201d including a \u201cmost concerning\u201d reference to what happened three years ago when Djokovic was kicked out of the country ahead of the tournament amid the pandemic.",
      "Before Jones and his employer offered their apologies, Djokovic posted a message on social media reiterating why he declined to speak. That drew a reply from billionaire X owner Elon Musk, who said, \u201cIt\u2019s way better just to talk to the public directly than go through the negativity filter of legacy media.\u201d",
      "Djokovic replied to Musk's tweet with \u201cIndeed\u201d and a raised-hands emoji.",

      "Officially, Indiana will be the home team on the scoreboard when it plays San Antonio in Paris on Thursday",
      "NANTERRE, France -- Officially, Indiana will be the home team on the scoreboard when it plays San Antonio in Paris on Thursday.",
      "The Pacers know better. They will not be feeling right at home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big crowd against us, honestly,\u201d Indiana guard Andrew Nembhard said.",
      "He\u2019s not wrong, for one 7-foot-4 reason. The upcoming NBA Paris Games \u2014 Indiana vs. San Antonio on Thursday and Saturday, the Pacers being the designated home team for the first matchup and the Spurs getting that distinction for the second game \u2014 are essentially going to be a weeklong celebration of France\u2019s own Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio\u2019s reigning NBA rookie of the year who likely will be an All-Star this season for the first time.",
      "In other words, welcome to Wemby Week in Paris.",
      "The teams arrived in Paris on Monday, with practices and other events scheduled throughout the week and then the games toward the end. The Spurs were coming straight from the airport to a light workout in Nanterre \u2014 the place where Wembanyama started his pro career in the French league as a 15-year-old.",
      "There have been single games in Paris in each of the last two seasons \u2014 Chicago-Detroit in 2023, Brooklyn-Cleveland last year \u2014 but this season, it\u2019s a two-game trip and Wembanyama is surely one of the reasons for that.",
      "Ticket demand was off the charts. The games sold out in a day. Some tickets remain as part of packages; for example, a game ticket for Thursday, including a chance to grab a picture with the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy, will set you back $730. Flight not included, of course.",
      "Then again, not everyone in attendance will have bought their tickets. Wembanyama arranged a treasure hunt for 10 tickets; there were QR codes hidden in five cities \u2014 Paris, Lyon, Lille, Marseille and Bordeaux \u2014 and he encouraged fans to start hunting.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t come back to the capital without giving you the opportunity to come see me play,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "The Spurs are a global brand with deep ties to France that pre-date Wembanyama\u2019s arrival in San Antonio. Tony Parker and Boris Diaw helped the Spurs establish that relationship with France during their years in Spurs colors, and now the interest can be marked in plenty of ways off the court as well. Last week, the Spurs announced a series of events for this week in collaboration with Paris-Saint Germain, one of the world\u2019s most-followed soccer teams.",
      "\u201cWe have a long history with France for obvious reasons in many ways. So, it\u2019s just another milestone or opportunity, I think, to probably strengthen that bond or connection,\u201d Spurs interim coach Mitch Johnson said. \u201cVery cool for Vic. Obviously, he just got done in the Olympics as well.\u201d",
      "France played host to the Paris Games last summer and Wembanyama helped his home nation get to the gold-medal game against the U.S. He was spectacular in the final, scoring 26 points. It wasn\u2019t enough, not with Stephen Curry leading the way with 24 for the Americans \u2014 capped by a barrage of four 3-pointers in the final couple of minutes to clinch the gold.",
      "Wembanyama settled for silver that night. The games this week are in the same arena as the Olympic final was. He was asked earlier this season how often he thinks about this trip and getting to play in Paris again.",
      "\u201cAll the time,\u201d he said.",
      "Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton was on that U.S. Olympic team. He knows what that arena felt like and can envision what it\u2019ll be like for Wembanyama\u2019s return this week.",
      "\u201cThe game has never seen anybody like him,\u201d Haliburton said.",
      "The Spurs played in Miami on Sunday and lost, then stuck around for a few hours to have some dinner and get their body clocks right for the 8-hour flight from South Florida to France. The Pacers were heading to do some sightseeing after landing Monday, including the Eiffel Tower.",
      "\u201cAll that good stuff,\u201d Pacers center Myles Turner said in a video released by the team.",
      "Paris has been waiting. And Wemby will be welcomed back like a conquering hero.",
      "\u201cI think any time anybody gets to play (or) perform back home, especially when that\u2019s not something you do consistently or regularly, it\u2019s a pretty cool opportunity,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be people at the game that haven\u2019t seen him play in a long time or typically maybe never have. You know, hometown kids get to see you \u2026 maybe they\u2019ve never been to an NBA game. So, I know there\u2019s a lot of things, not to speak for him, that I\u2019m sure he\u2019s looking forward to and that are unique in a very, very cool way for him to connect.\u201d",

      "The White Sox said on social media that Torborg \u2014 who was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2010 \u2014 died in his hometown of Westfield, New Jersey. A cause of death wasn't given.",
      "\u201cI am heartbroken,\u201d former White Sox player and manager Ozzie Guillen posted on X. \u201cMy mentor and my friend has passed away. Someone who truly understood me and gave me a chance to lead, to be a captain. So much of my way of managing and being in a clubhouse came from him.\u201d",
      "Torborg was behind the plate for three no-hitters, the first with Koufax and the Los Angeles Dodgers for the perfect game against the Chicago Cubs in 1965. Torborg had the second in 1970 with Bill Singer for the Dodgers against Philadelphia, then in 1973 with the Angels caught the first of Nolan Ryan\u2019s record seven no-hitters in a game against Kansas City.",
      "After starring at Westfield High School and Rutgers University, Torborg spent 10 seasons in the majors as player \u2014 the first seven with the Dodgers and the last three with the Angels. He hit .214 with eight homers and 101 RBIs in 574 games.",
      "He began his managing career with Cleveland in 1977 at the age of 35 and was let go in 1979. He was with the White Sox from 1989-91 and also had stints with the New York Mets (1992-93), Montreal (2000) and Florida (2002-03). He was the AL manager of the year in 1990, leading the White Sox to 94 victories.",
      "\u201cRIP Jeff Torborg!\u201d former White Sox slugger Frank Thomas said on X. \u201cYou were my first big league manager and I enjoyed playing for you. You gave me a chance to shine right away and I\u2019m very thankful. God Bless the Torborg family.\u201d",
      "Torborg was a member of the Dodgers' 1965 championship team, but didn't appear in the World Series against Minnesota.",
      "Torborg also spent time as a broadcaster.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day to lose a great man with such high character,\u201d said Robin Ventura, who played for Torborg from 1989-91 with Chicago. \u201cHe was a family man who ran his team like a family. I smile as I think of him in the dugout wearing his soccer cleats as he managed his team.\u201d",
      "Torborg is survived by his wife of nearly 62 years, Suzie, sons Doug, Greg and Dale, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.",

      "Ichiro Suzuki is all about baseball, but he is much more than that at home in Japan",
      "TOKYO -- Ichiro Suzuki is all about baseball, but he's much more than that in Japan.",
      "Back home, he's a wellspring of national pride, much like Shohei Ohtani now. His triumphs across the Pacific buoyed the nation as Japan's economy sputtered through the so-called lost decades of the 1990s and into the 2000s.",
      "\u201cHe healed the wounds in Japan\u2019s national psyche,\u201d Kiyoteru Tsutsui, professor of sociology at Stanford University, told The Associated Press.",
      "On Tuesday, he\u2019s expected to be the first Japanese player elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and possibly only the second player chosen unanimously after New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera.",
      "Ichiro debuted in Major League Baseball in 2001 with the Seattle Mariners, the first Japanese position player to span the Pacific and an instant star. Left-handed pitcher Hideo Nomo preceded him, and Hideki Matsui came just after, both boosting the country's confidence in a period of national malaise.",
      "Tsutsui termed Ichiro a \u201cgreat cultural export,\" akin to Hello Kitty, sushi, manga and others creations from Japan.",
      "\u201cIt may not be an exaggeration to say that Ichiro represents Japan's transition from the faceless economic animal to a producer of global cultural icons,\u201d Tsutsui said.",
      "Ichiro started playing baseball at age 7 on a Little League team near Nagoya in central Japan. Sure, baseball is baseball, but the culture around the game \u2014 known as \u201cyakyu\u201d (field ball) \u2014 is special.",
      "He was driven by his father, Nobuyuki Suzuki, and came up through what is often described as a regimented baseball-training system that some link to the martial arts and even samurai history.",
      "Ichiro grew to be hip in the majors, which fit the nation\u2019s branding as \u201cCool Japan.\u201d On the way, he bumped into pressure in Japan to conform, expressed in the saying \u201cderu kugi wa utareru.\u201d",
      "Roughly in English: \u201cThe nail that sticks up gets hammered down.\u201d",
      "\u201cYoung people flocked to watch him because they saw his do-it-my-way rebel spirit,\u201d William Kelly, emeritus professor of Japanese studies at Yale University, wrote in an email. \u201cOld fans were drawn to his seriousness of purpose and his force of concentration.\u2019",
      "Ichiro developed his unique swing very early, lifting his right leg and almost running to first base before hitting the ball. Repeatedly told in Japan to change it, he declined.",
      "His given name Ichiro \u2014 \u2019ichi\u201d means \u201cone\u201d in Japanese \u2014 started appearing on the back of his jersey in 1994 with the Orix BlueWave. Suzuki is a very common family name, and manager Akira Ohgi wanted to single out Ichiro for attention.",
      "\u201cI see Ichiro as an artist, a craftsman,\u201d said Shimpei Miyagawa, an assistant professor at Temple University in Japan. \u201cThe point is that Ichiro is someone who stands out in both singular talent and longevity in a game that is ironically played as a team sport.\u201d",
      "A Japanese, Miyagawa taught high school in Massachusetts and recalls students wearing Ichiro jerseys \u2014 in the heart of Boston Red Sox country.",
      "\u201cTo me that speaks volumes about the cultural breakthrough,\u201d Miyagawa said.",
      "Ichiro's games were shown live and on tape when be began playing with the Mariners.",
      "Nomo had a similar effect when he debuted with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1995. Ichiro topped that interest level, wrote Robert Whiting in his book \u201cThe Samurai Way of Baseball.\u201d",
      "\u201cIchiro was the first to appear front and center ever single day \u2014 a slender Japanese among pumped up musclemen, sparking big American teammates to victory \u2014 and the public could simply not get enough of this delectable sight,\" he wrote.",
      "Whiting wrote that few Japanese had seen much of Ichiro when he played in Japan for the BlueWave in the western city of Kobe.",
      "\u201cHis face adorned billboards all over Japan. Yet he nearly always played to half-empty stands, in games that were almost never telecast nationally.\u201d",
      "Ichiro will go into the Hall of Fame as professional baseball\u2019s all-time leader in hits with 4,367 (3,089 in MLB and 1,278 in Japan) \u2014 more even than Pete Rose's 4,256. He broke George Sisler\u2019s single-season hits mark of 257 in 2004. The new mark is 262.",
      "He played his last two games in 2019 in the Tokyo Dome against the Athletics, going 0 for 5 for the Mariners and then retiring at 45.",
      "\u201cI really wanted to play until I was 50,\u201d he said after his final game. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t do it. But it was a way of motivating myself. If I had never said that, I don\u2019t think I would have come this far.\u201d",
      "Ichiro made global news just over a year ago when he broke a window with a 426-foot home run while teaching students batting techniques at a Japanese high school.",
      "Much of Ichiro\u2019s early life is documented in the modest Ichiro Exhibition Room in his hometown of Toyoyama. It\u2019s situated in a residential area, a four-story, inconspicuous building; a shrine filled with Ichiro memorabilia.",
      "It\u2019s only open on the weekends and it\u2019s sure to become popular as this summer\u2019s Cooperstown induction nears. A marker guiding tourists to the office is graced with a silhouette of left-handed hitting Ichiro \u2014 his right leg raised as he begins his swing.",
      "Baseball was introduced into schools in Japan in 1872 by an American teacher, and many have used it to gauge the country\u2019s march toward modernization after centuries of isolation from the West.",
      "Ichiro's Hall of Fame enshrinement coincides with a surge of Japanese players shining in MLB. Ohtani is a singular talent in the history of the sport, and he was one of a dozen Japanese exports in the majors last season, including Yu Darvish, Shota Imanaga and $325 million Dodgers ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto.",
      "\u201cIchiro and Ohtani command so much respect from their peers and the public alike because they are focused on honing their crafts,\u201d Tsutsui wrote.",
      "Phenom pitcher Roki Sasaki, who announced Friday he's leaving Japan to join Ohtani on the Dodgers, continues the evolution.",
      "\u201cThe Hall of Fame vote caps that process,\u201d Tsutsui added. \u201cAnd many Japanese embrace the recognition that he is one of the greatest players to ever play in the Majors.\u201d",

This one, though, will be the first at the Australian Open \u2014 and the first in the quarterfinals of a tournament; each of the others came in either a semifinal or final.",
      "\u201cWell, this is not the right player to play in a quarterfinal, I guess,\u201d a grinning Alcaraz said, looking ahead to Tuesday's encounter. \u201cBut facing Novak, for me, it\u2019s not going to change anything if I\u2019m playing him (in a) quarterfinal or semifinal. Probably change a little bit if it is a final, obviously. Being in a quarterfinal, I\u2019m going to approach the match the same as I did in the previous matches against him, and let\u2019s see.\u201d",
      "Alcaraz reached his 10th career Grand Slam quarterfinal, tied for the most by a man before his 22nd birthday, by advancing when 15th-seeded Jack Draper stopped playing because of a hip injury after dropping the first two sets Sunday afternoon.",
      "Djokovic, who is being coached in Melbourne by old rival Andy Murray, did his part at night in Rod Laver Arena, needing to work a little longer but getting through just the same with a 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory over No. 24 Jiri Lehecka.",
      "Djokovic smacked a ball off a wall in the third set, drawing boos and whistles from some spectators. When they made more noise moments later, chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani admonished the folks in the stands to be more polite toward the players.",
      "Otherwise, though, Djokovic had plenty of support, from the Serbian flags in the stands to the chants of his nickname, \u201cNole,\u201d that reverberated around the main stadium.",
      "Afterward, Djokovic dispensed with the customary on-court interview, instead holding the microphone himself and telling the crowd: \u201cThank you very much for being here tonight. I appreciate your presence and the support. I\u2019ll see you next round. Thank you very much.\u201d Then he walked off.",
      "There is plenty at stake at this tournament for both No. 3 seed Alcaraz, who is 21, and No. 7 Djokovic, who is 37.",
      "Alcaraz seeks to become the youngest man to complete a career Grand Slam with at least one trophy from all four of the most prestigious events in tennis. His four so far came elsewhere: two at Wimbledon by virtue of wins over Djokovic in the 2023 and 2024 finals, and one apiece at the U.S. Open in 2022 and the French Open last year.",
      "Djokovic, meanwhile, is trying to claim an 11th title in Melbourne to become the first player in tennis history with 25 major singles championships. He leads the overall head-to-head against Alcaraz 4-3, including a victory in the final at the Paris Olympics last August to claim a gold medal for Serbia.",
      "At the majors, though, Alcaraz leads 2-1.",
      "\u201cIf I think about everything he has done in tennis, I couldn\u2019t play. I mean, 24 Grand Slam, the most weeks at No. 1 \u2014 everything. He almost broke every record in tennis. I\u2019m trying not to think about that when I\u2019m in the match. I\u2019m just trying ... to beat him,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cI know my weapons. I know that (if) I\u2019m able to play good tennis against him, I\u2019m able to beat him.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Alcaraz was ahead 7-5, 6-1 when Draper decided he couldn't continue. He'd been dealing with physical issues after winning each of his first three matches at Melbourne Park in five sets.",
      "\u201cIt's not the way I want to win a match, to get through to the next round,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cHappy to play another quarterfinal here in Australia, but a little bit sad for Jack.\u201d",
      "Sunday's match goes into the books as a victory for Alcaraz, his first against a top-20 opponent at the Australian Open. He pulled even with Bjorn Borg, Boris Becker and Mats Wilander for the highest number of major quarterfinal appearances before 22.",
      "Alcaraz's best run at Melbourne Park was getting to the quarterfinals last year, before losing at that stage to Alexander Zverev. The other quarterfinal on the bottom half of the men's bracket will be No. 2 Zverev against No. 12 Tommy Paul.",

      "It didn't matter.",
      "The Lions self-destructed against the Washington Commanders, turning the ball over five times in a 45-31 loss on Saturday night that ended another chance at the franchise's first Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cWe just didn't complement each other,\u201d said coach Dan Campbell, who nearly came to tears during his postgame news conference. \u201cWe didn't get a stop when we needed one, and when we got a stop, we turned the ball over. With five turnovers \u2014 even if one was at the end and it was really four, that's too much.\u201d",
      "Jared Goff took most of the blame \u2014 he threw three interceptions and lost his first fumble of the season. One of the picks was returned 40 yards for a touchdown by Quan Martin to give the Commanders a 24-14 lead.",
      "\u201cIf I play better, do we win? Quite possibly,\u201d Goff said. \u201cI cost us points by not taking care of the ball, and that's something that's going to hurt for a long time.\u201d",
      "Goff didn't have a great night, but he wasn't playing defense. Washington rookie Jayden Daniels played a lot like Goff at his best \u2014 completing passes that gave his receivers a chance to run. Of his 299 passing yards, 188 came after the catch.",
      "\u201cWe knew what the tape said about him,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe knew we were going to have our hands full and we didn't handle it as well as we wanted.\u201d",
      "That wasn't the only problem, though. Detroit's injury-riddled defense gave up 481 yards \u2014 its third most this season \u2014 including 182 on the ground. Brian Robinson Jr. and Austin Ekeler combined for 124 yards on 21 carries and Daniels added 51 more.",

      "The injuries didn't explain the mental mistakes, though. Detroit was within 31-28 early in the fourth quarter and had the Commanders facing fourth-and-2 from the Lions 5. A stop could have changed the game \u2014 but the Lions were called for 12 men on the field. Two plays later, Robinson scored to make it 38-28.",
      "Campbell took the blame for the play, but there was still time to rally until an inexplicable decision to have Jameson Williams throw a pass to Jahmyr Gibbs. Williams looked tentative as he rolled right and threw into coverage. Rookie Mike Sainristil grabbed his second interception of the night and Washington ran 4:33 off the clock before scoring another touchdown that made it 45-28.",
      "\u201cObviously, I wish he had run the ball,\u201d Campbell said.",

      "This time, he couldn't even address that topic.",
      "\u201cThis isn't the time \u2014 this hurts too much,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn't the time to talk about our great season and all our wins. The whole point of playing is to get to the biggest game and we didn't make it.\u201d",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses could push states to become more open to crypto and lead public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it.",
      "Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.",
      "Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to say government-backed currencies are prone to devaluation and increased government buy-ins will stabilize future price swings, giving them more legitimacy and boosting already rising prices.",
      "But the risks are significant. Critics say crypto investments are highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting future returns. They warn that investors should be prepared to lose money.",
      "Only a couple of public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency. A U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued late last year, warned it has \u201cuniquely high volatility.\u201d It found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto.",
      "2024 was a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin surpassing $100,000. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. Now, crypto enthusiasts are banking on Trump's promise to make the United States the \u201cbitcoin superpower\u201d of the world.",
      "Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills this year to make them crypto-friendly. Analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby. Bitcoin miners are building new installations and venture capitalists are underwriting a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies.",
      "Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback.",
      "A bill introduced in November in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir.",

      "Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn\u2019t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto.",
      "Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek.",
      "\u201cThere might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,\u201d Brainard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.\u201d",
      "Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system allowing people to pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies.",
      "Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather views it as a recognition that the government must innovate and be flexible about helping people do business with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that at some point it\u2019ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cAnd when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation.",
      "Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said.",
      "Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin.",
      "That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York.",
      "Pension boards got investment tools they like last year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. In October, it approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said.",
      "Many \u201care likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that\u2019s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs.",
      "In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it.",
      "Michigan's state investment board reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases, while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto.",
      "Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund.",

      "After going dark for users this weekend, Trump said on his social media site that he would issue an executive order after he's sworn in for a second term on Monday delaying a TikTok ban \u201cso that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\u201d He said the order would make clear that companies will not be held liable for violating a law that aimed to force TikTok's sale by its China-based parent company. Hours later, the app returned, to the relief of its legions of dedicated users.",
      "\u201cThanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!\" read the announcement.",
      "Trump's legal authority to unilaterally decide not to enforce the law, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in April and was upheld by the Supreme Court on Friday, is unclear. But the rapid developments over the weekend served as a reminder of how dramatically debates over technology, social media and national security have changed since Trump was last in the White House. It also signaled how closely Trump is following those shifts after waging a successful campaign in which he made inroads with voters in part by harnessing the appeal of some social media platforms.",
      "Trump can now take credit for reviving an app with 170 million users that is especially popular with younger Americans, many of whom spend hours a day on the platform to get news, make money and find entertainment.",
      "\u201cThis is one of those things where the domestic politics has become so upside down and crazy that it turns out there\u2019s only upside for Trump now,\u201d said Bill Bishop, a China expert who has been closely following the back-and-forth. If the bans ends up being enforced, he said, Trump will say it was on outgoing President Joe Biden\u2019s watch. \u201cAnd if it does come back then Trump is a savior. And he will be rewarded both by users\u201d as well as the company, which he said is now \u201cbeholden to Trump\u201d and will have an incentive to make sure content on the platform is favorable to him.",
      "TikTok\u2019s move comes as tech companies and CEOs have been been working furiously to improve their standing with Trump. X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has enjoyed unprecedented access to the president-elect after spending more than $200 million and personally campaigning to help him get elected.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and reshaped his social media platforms\u2019 policies to align more closely with Trump\u2019s worldview earlier this month, ending third-party fact-checking, loosening rules against hate speech, ending his company\u2019s diversity and equity policies and naming Dana White, the president and CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a familiar figure in Trump\u2019s orbit, to its board.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Amazon, Meta and Google have all pledged to donate $1 million each to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "The companies have a lot on the line, including regulatory challenges. Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump\u2019s first term as president \u2014 and flourished under Biden \u2014 most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to business mergers.",
      "TikTok also worked to curry Trump's favor, with CEO Shou Chew meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago in December. In a video responding to the Supreme Court decision, Chew was careful to praise Trump and cast the app's fate as dependent on him.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform.\"",
      "When the app went dark, it had initially posted a simple message informing users of the change, but later updated the language to include Trump.",
      "\u201cSorry, TikTok isn\u2019t available right now,\u201d it read. \u201cA law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\u201d",
      "The federal law had required TikTok parent company ByteDance to cut ties with the platform\u2019s U.S. operations by Sunday. The Biden administration had stressed in recent days that it did not intend to enforce the ban before Trump took office. But TikTok said it would nonetheless \u201cgo dark\u201d because the Biden administration had not provided \u201cnecessary clarity and assurance\u201d to service providers \u2014 a stance outgoing Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer cast as disingenuous.",
      "\u201cFrankly, it doesn\u2019t feel completely on the level,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\" \u201cI think we were extremely clear that there was no need to take this action,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Saturday that he was considering granting ByteDance a 90-day extension to sell. ByteDance has repeatedly refused to sell, but the company is being eyed by investors including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said there was no evidence ByteDance had made any meaningful progress toward divestiture, \u201cso I don\u2019t see how, by any measure, it would legally meet those conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cFurther, an Executive Order cannot legally override or cancel a law that Congress passed,\u201d she said. \"Laws enacted through the legislative process have a higher legal standing and an EO that conflicts with the existing law, the law takes precedence and the EO would likely be struck down by the courts.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republican chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, warned Sunday that there is no legal basis for the kind of extension Trump is pursuing.",
      "\u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThink about it.\u201d",
      "Trump, in his Sunday post, proposed new terms of a deal in which he said the United States would have \u201ca 50% ownership position in a joint venture\u201d that would be \"set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.\u201d But the details remained murky and it was unclear whether Trump was proposing control by the U.S. government or another company. Trump did not elaborate during a rally Sunday night, where he hailed the move.",
      "\u201cAs of today, TikTok is back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice. We have to save it.\u201d",
      "Though Trump sought to ban TikTok during his first term, he reversed that stance during his 2024 campaign, when he came to believe a ban would help the app's rival, Facebook, which he held responsible, in part, to his 2020 election loss to Biden.",
      "Trump ended up joining the app last year and has grown his following to nearly 15 million users. He has since credited the app for helping him win over young voters.",
      "\u201cI have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d he said during a December news conference. \u201cTikTok had an impact.\u201d",

      "About half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure and too few have it under control",
      "WASHINGTON -- Nothing doctors prescribed controlled Michael Garrity\u2019s dangerously high blood pressure \u2014 until they zapped away some nerves on his kidneys.",
      "If that sounds weird, well, kidneys help regulate blood pressure in part through signals from certain nerves. The new treatment disrupts overactive renal nerves.",
      "\u201cMy blood pressure would spike and I\u2019d run out of breath and feel tired, and that doesn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d said Garrity, 62, of Needham, Massachusetts. He still takes medicine but at lower doses, his blood pressure normal for the first time in years. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure, a major risk for heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, even dementia. Many people don\u2019t even realize they have hypertension until it\u2019s done serious damage.",
      "\u201cKnow your blood pressure, know the numbers,\u201d stressed Dr. Randy Zusman of Massachusetts General Hospital, who specializes in the hardest-to-treat cases and advises people who think they\u2019re fine to at least get a yearly check.",
      "And only a fraction of patients have their hypertension well-controlled, meaning there\u2019s a need for novel strategies. The Food and Drug Administration approved that \u201crenal denervation\u201d option about a year ago, based on studies showing a modest benefit in patients whose blood pressure remains high despite multiple medicines.",
      "Now, after the American Heart Association recently deemed it promising, some hospitals including Mass General Brigham are cautiously offering it as they work out who are good candidates \u2014 and whether their insurance will cover a minimally invasive procedure costing thousands of dollars.",
      "Two numbers describe blood pressure. The top, \u201csystolic\u201d pressure, is the force blood puts on the walls of arteries as its pumped out of the heart. The bottom \u201cdiastolic\u201d number measures that same pressure but between heartbeats.",
      "Normal is less than 120 over 80. Blood pressure naturally fluctuates throughout the day, higher when you\u2019re physically active or stressed. But when it stays high \u2014 consistently 130 over 80 or higher, according to the most recent guidelines \u2014 it stiffens arteries and makes the heart work harder.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take a doctor\u2019s visit. Pharmacies and sometimes even libraries offer screening, and people can use at-home monitors.",
      "To avoid falsely high readings, the American Medical Association has tips: Sit quietly with feet on the floor, legs not crossed. Place the cuff on a bare arm, not over clothing. Don\u2019t dangle the arm \u2014 rest it on a table.",
      "Lifestyle changes are the first step, especially for otherwise healthy people. Guidelines urge losing weight, exercise, eating more fruits and vegetables, limiting salt and alcohol, and taking steps to handle stress.",
      "Medicine is a must once hypertension reaches 140 over 90. The average patient requires two or three drugs, sometimes more, along with healthier living, Zusman said.",
      "But the hypertension Garrity has struggled with since his late 20s is treatment-resistant. Despite taking four to six drugs plus a strict diet and exercise, his blood pressure regularly reached 150 over 100 or worse.",
      "Doctors thread a small catheter, or tube, through blood vessels to reach the kidneys, and then beam in ultrasound or radiofrequency energy. Those pulses pass through the renal arteries to selectively target surrounding nerves, said Dr. Joseph Garasic, a Mass General interventional cardiologist who performed Garrity\u2019s procedure. It takes about an hour.",
      "Although already used in other countries, a key U.S. trial of renal denervation failed about a decade ago, prompting changes before researchers tried again. In November 2023, the FDA approved two catheter systems, from Recor Medical and Medtronic.",
      "It\u2019s not a cure \u2013 and some patients get no benefit. But Garasic said multiple studies show on average an 8 to 10-point drop in blood pressure, a modest but important improvement. Some like Garrity see a bigger drop, enough to gradually scale back medications.",
      "The FDA deemed the procedure safe for carefully chosen patients \u2014 it wasn\u2019t tested in those with kidney disease or narrowed arteries, for example. And studies have lasted only a few years, not long enough to tell if the nerves might eventually regenerate.",

      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles versus those still standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world",
      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles next to those left standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world.",
      "For many homeowners, like Enrique Balcazar, the sometimes scattershot nature of the carnage can seem like random chance. Balcazar, a real estate agent, posted video that showed little more than chimneys remaining of most homes on his block after fire leapt through his Altadena neighborhood. Balcazar stood on his neighbor's destroyed classic Mustang to douse his smoldering roof, but his home was otherwise fine.",
      "\u201cIt's an older house and it still has the old wood sidings,\u201d Balcazar said. \u201cTo me there's nothing explainable in logical or scientific reason of why my house would not have burned.\u201d",
      "Many experts say luck does play a part. After all, wind can shift 180 degrees in a split second, pushing fire away from your house and towards a neighbor's. But they also say there are many ways that homes can be made less vulnerable to fire.",
      "\u201cBecause there are, say, 50 ways a fire can burn your house,\" said Greg Faulkner of Faulkner Architects in California, who has focused on less combustible home exteriors for more than a decade. \u201cIf you eliminate half of those, or three-quarters of them, that\u2019s not luck, that\u2019s increasing your odds.\u201d",
      "People in fire country generally know that trees, landscaping and wood fences near homes can be a fire risk. Architects and contractors are going beyond that, using newer materials and techniques in roofing, walls and windows to keep buildings standing. The measures do add cost to the homes \u2014 around 3% to 6%, Faulkner said, or as much as 10% for the most robust protection.",
      "Many of these experts no longer use wood siding. Where it is used, or still allowed, it needs to have a fire-resistant barrier underneath, often made of gypsum, the same material used to make drywall. That way if the wood catches fire, it takes longer for the heat to reach inside the home",
      "But even with that, you\u2019re still putting a combustible material on the building, said Richard Schuh, with Nielsen : Schuh Architects. \u201cSo that would be something we would avoid. Use of fire-resistant materials is critical.\u201d",
      "Stucco, a cement material, is a common exterior for Southern California houses and it's fire-resistant. Reviewing AP photographs showing buildings still standing, Arnold Tarling, who has four decades experience in fire protection and building inspection in Britain, said houses with stucco walls appeared to survive the Los Angeles fires better. Yet if more of them had had a layer of gypsum beneath the stucco, it would have given more protection from the heat, he said.",
      "Windows are a huge factor in whether a home burns down, because so much heat is transmitted through them. Double-pane windows significantly slow heat coming from the burning building next door.",
      "\u201cThe outside layer protects the inside layer until it fails,\u201d said Schuh. Codes in many places require one of the two panes to be tempered, which is much more resistant to heat than conventional glass, he said.",
      "Tarling noted one intact Malibu beachfront home, surrounded by gutted buildings. He speculated that the fact that no windows faced a neighbor helped protect it because radiated heat couldn\u2019t penetrate as easily.",
      "In his buildings, Faulkner builds in fire shutters that can slide closed and cover the windows.",
      "Then there's the roof \u2014 a convenient landing pad for fire embers.",
      "Simpler roof lines can allow red-hot embers to slide off. Spanish Mission, for example, is an iconic Los Angeles style \u2014 part of what says \u201cHollywood\u201d in movies about the city, for example, as well as a reminder of its Mexican and Spanish history. That style doesn\u2019t always have simple roof lines \u2014 the knee walls that are common on Mission-style roofs create corners.",
      "\u201cThe embers could, just like snow, gather in that corner,\u201d Faulkner said.",
      "Many roofs in the U.S. are covered in asphalt. Areas that are designated as wildfire-prone in California \u2013 an ever-growing area \u2013 are required to use roofing that delays the transfer of heat to the inside of the building, called one-hour or Class A.",
      "Still, asphalt is a petroleum product. Some building professionals prefer metal, which doesn\u2019t burn. Metal has its own downside, though: It conducts heat. Putting a layer of gypsum under a metal roof is becoming a common practice in some areas.",
      "Maybe as important as which material is used on a roof is whether the roof offers fire a way to get in. Here, as in so many tradeoffs, one effort to do good conflicts with another: Contractors have been more careful over the years to make sure moisture doesn't build up in attics by making sure air circulates, using those vents that are visible on many roofs or under eaves.",
      "But in a powerful fire, Schuh says, \u201cif you\u2019re on the side where the wind is putting pressure against the house, it\u2019s also blowing the flames into the house like a blow torch,\u201d and fire gets in through the vents.",
      "On the other side of the house, it can create a vacuum, several experts said, sucking fire in.",
      "But you can\u2019t easily just eliminate roof ventilation because it will cause moisture problems, said Cesar Martin Gomez, an architect at the University of Navarra, Spain, who\u2019s worked for 25 years in building services.",
      "Faulkner said in some buildings he's eliminating the need for ventilation in the roof structure by sealing the spaces. Schuh is using a cover on roof vents that can actually respond to fire with a mesh that closes.",
      "Martin Gomez noted that in some parts of Australia, new homes are required to have water tanks. \u201cIf each home has the ability to protect itself, fire won\u2019t be able to spread as much,\u201d he said.",
      "And some homes in the U.S. are now built with sprinkler systems for the outside of the house, not just the inside. It sprays water with a soapy solution to make it flow over the surface of the building, Schuh said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re adding one more layer of protection to your building, and that\u2019s more of a priority now than ever because your insurance company may or not be around for you,\u201d he said.",

      "With President-elect Donald Trump adding uncertainty around whether a TikTok ban will go into effect, the focus is now turning to companies like Google and Apple that are expected to take the popular video sharing app off their platforms in just two days.",
      "Though the Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a federal law that could ban TikTok nationwide, it\u2019s unclear how a shutdown of the popular social media platform will play out and what Americans will see when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday.",
      "The court decision comes against a backdrop of unusual political agitation by Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution after he takes office, and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it won\u2019t enforce the law beginning Sunday, his final full day in office. Now, tech observers \u2014 and some users \u2014 are intently watching to see what happens over the weekend and beyond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really in uncharted territory here in terms of tech policy,\u201d said Sarak Kreps, the director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "Under the law, mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could pay up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties could total to a large sum.",
      "A lawyer representing TikTok told Supreme Court justices last week that the platform will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the law isn\u2019t struck down. But TikTok, which is not required to block its own platform under the statute, has not said whether it will limit access to the app, or its website, on Sunday. Experts have noted TikTok\u2019s app should remain available for current users, but existing ones will no longer be able to update it, making it unusable in the long term.",
      "Trump\u2019s national security adviser has signaled this week that the incoming administration may take steps to \u201ckeep TikTok from going dark,\u201d though what that looks like \u2014 and if any of those steps can withhold legal scrutiny \u2014 remains unclear.",
      "\u201cMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not-too-distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,\u201d Trump said Friday in a post on Truth Social after the court\u2019s ruling. Earlier in the day, he said in another post that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "In the meantime, some of the attention has turned to tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Oracle, who currently offer TikTok on their app stores or host company data on their servers.",
      "Tech CEOs have been attempting to forge friendlier ties with Trump, who wants to put the TikTok ban on hold, since he was elected in November. But Kreps said it would \u201cdefy credulity\u201d for them to continue to offer TikTok, even if they want to please Trump, since it would open them up to punitive fines.",
      "Tech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.",
      "\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d",
      "Apple, Google and Oracle did not respond to questions sent this week about their plans on TikTok.",
      "In a video after the court ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is expected to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration and be granted a prime seating location on the dais, thanked the president-elect for \u201chis commitment to work\u201d with TikTok to \u201cfind a solution\u201d that keeps the platform available.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform \u2014 one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\u201d Chew said.",
      "Earlier this week, TikTok told its U.S. employees that its offices would remain open for work even if the \u201csituation\u201d won\u2019t be resolved by Sunday. In the memo, which was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed by the company, TikTok told workers that their \u201cemployment, pay and benefits\u201d were secure, adding that the law was written in a way that impacts the U.S. user experience, not the entities that employ them.",
      "Meanwhile, in a letter sent Friday to Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, an attorney for TikTok creators who sued the government asked the administration to pause enforcement of the law \u201cuntil there is further definitive guidance.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- As the fate of TikTok hangs in the balance, U.S. TikTok users are flocking to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu, also called RedNote \u2013 making it the top downloaded app in the U.S.",
      "Some of the \u201cTikTok refugees,\u201d as they call themselves, say the TikTok alternative, a Chinese app, is being chosen in protest of the TikTok ban. Here's what you need to know about Xiaohongshu.",
      "It is a lifestyle social media app which allows users to post short videos, photos and texts, and it also includes functions like live-streaming and shopping.",
      "A rare wave of U.S.-China camaraderie broke out online in recent days as \u201crefugees\u201d from the popular short video platform TikTok poured onto a Chinese social media platform to protest a likely ban on the service.",
      "They were met with surprise, curiosity and in-jokes on Xiaohongshu \u2014 literally, \u201cLittle Red Book\u201d \u2014 whose users saw English-language posts take over feeds almost overnight.",

      "It\u2019s a rare moment of direct contact between two online worlds that are usually kept apart by language, corporate boundaries, and China\u2019s strict system of online censorship that blocks access to nearly all international media and social media services.",
      "Chinese and American users rarely find themselves in the same online spaces, in large part because China\u2019s \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d blocks internationally popular platforms like Instagram and X. Even TikTok blocks users in China, directing them to its onshore sister platform Douyin.",

      "The company hasn\u2019t released official data, but the app has reached No. 1 in free downloads on both iOS and Android, remaining in that spot for days.",
      "On the platform, two versions of the TikTok refugee hashtag have over 24 million posts, with related posts appearing at the top of many users\u2019 feeds.",
      "A large number of American users say they\u2019ve received a warm welcome from the community, with #TikTokrefugee. \u201cWelcome the global villagers\u201d remains the top one trending topic on Xiaohongshu, with 8.9 million views on Thursday.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. is inching closer and closer to a potential TikTok ban \u2014 with the nation's highest court upholding a law that's set to halt new downloads of the app starting Sunday. But many questions around what exactly this ban will look like, and whether it will actually be enforced, remain.",
      "That puts millions of users and content creators in limbo \u2014 particularly influencers and small business owners who have come to rely on the mega-popular social media platform as a source of income.",
      "Among those individuals is Terrell Wade, a comedian, actor and content creator with 1.5 million followers on TikTok under the handle @TheWadeEmpire. Wade, who has turned his TikTok presence into a full-time job, said he expects \u201ctwo days of chaos\u201d as the Sunday deadline nears.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d Wade told The Associated Press.",
      "In a unanimous decision on Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that will ban TikTok unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company before Jan. 19 \u2014 ruling that a risk to national security posed by the platform's ties to China overcomes First Amendment concerns about limiting free speech on and by the app.",
      "A sale does not appear imminent, meaning the ban should go into effect Sunday. But the ruling also arrives just days before the inauguration of a new president.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration has maintained that TikTok must change its ownership to address national security concerns, but signaled that it won't enforce the law on Sunday, the Democrat's final full day in office. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that actions to enforce the law will fall to the new administration due to \u201cthe sheer fact of timing.\" Meanwhile, Republican President-elect Donald Trump, who once also tried to ban TikTok, has now vowed to preserve access to the platform. But what his options will be following Monday's inauguration remains unclear.",
      "Among other points of confusion is what a ban on TikTok will look like. Experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users\u2019 devices once the law takes effect. But new users won\u2019t be able to download it and updates will not be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department said in court filings.",
      "All of this is \u201ca reminder to the creator community that social media platforms can come and go,\u201d notes Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst at Forrester, stressing the disruptions TikTok creators and influencers will feel if the ban takes effect. If access is lost, she adds, many will have to pivot and re-build their presence on other platforms.",
      "While bracing for a potential Sunday ban, Wade is among creators who hope that something happens to avert the shutdown, although he thinks he has enough followers on other platforms to stay afloat.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still remaining optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Still, many continue to express fears over the potential of losing TikTok.",
      "Janette Ok, a full-time content creator based in Los Angeles, says TikTok is the primary platform she uses today. As an influencer and also an artist, she says the platform has helped her make brand deals and promote her music \u2014 bringing \u201copportunities that I never believed I could experience in my lifetime.\u201d",
      "Ok was also among influencers who TikTok brought to Washington in 2023 to lobby for the preservation of the app, and remembers a ban being discussed as far back as 2020. And as someone who is Asian, the efforts to ban TikTok over the years have also felt \u201ca little xenophobic,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cI hear all these different things, and I don\u2019t know what to believe \u2014 so that\u2019s where I\u2019m very frustrated. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m disappointed,\" Ok said. \"It\u2019s a beautiful app, it\u2019s brought so many people together, it\u2019s changed a lot of people\u2019s lives, and for it to just be taken away like that feels ... so not American.\u201d",
      "Jordan Smith, a former WNBA player who operates The Elevated Closet in Austin, Texas \u2014 a clothing brand for tall women \u2014 depends on TikTok and TikTok Shop to find customers that fit her niche demographic that\u2019s difficult to specifically market to otherwise.",
      "\u201cOn TikTok I\u2019ve just been able to find that audience so much easier,\u201d she said.",
      "She fears losing TikTok will hurt her business, and she'll miss it personally, too. So she\u2019s following what people are saying will happen on Sunday and hopes a ban might be diverted.",
      "\u201cIt kind of seems like Biden\u2019s kind of pushing it off to Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cSo people have hopes that maybe we have a few more days and it won\u2019t go dark on Sunday, but I don\u2019t really know.\u201d",
      "Alejandro Flores-Munoz owns a catering business in the Denver area called Combi Taco, or @combicafe on TikTok. TikTok helped him reach customers without spending money on marketing, he said. He was optimistic that TikTok would stick around until he heard Friday's Supreme Court decision.",
      "\u201cUp until today, I was extremely optimistic. And after today\u2019s Supreme Court decision to uphold the ban or the sale of TikTok, I weigh my options,\u201d he said. \u201cBut honestly, it\u2019s very disheartening, specifically because I truly did rely on the app for my business and my growth of my business.\u201d",

      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Sebastian Ray Serpa, a 16-year-old high school student from Volusia County, passes by Daytona International Speedway often and hears the roar of race cars from outside the gates but had never before been inside the \u201cWorld Center of Racing.\u201d",
      "After an immersive experience Friday designed for talented STEM students, Ray Serpa \u201cwill definitely\u201d be returning for next week's Rolex 24 at Daytona \u2014 his first ever motorsports event.",

      "Ray Serpa, who described himself as passionate about mechanical engineering, was blown away. He thought he'd like a future learning about how the human joint works. After stops at four different stations and a tour of the speedway and cars, he's now aware motorsports is an option.",
      "\u201cThis has been a real eye-opener for me,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI knew that behind almost every concept out there there were opportunities, but I never realized how wide that actually went. There are so many applications that require STEM skills. I heard from marketing people who went to school for mechanical engineering, and then ended up getting greater satisfaction from marketing. Or, they still work hand-in-hand. I would really like to get to a point where I can say the same.\u201d",
      "It is the debut year for the program in IMSA sports car racing, but series president John Doonan ran a similar STEM experience when he was head of Mazda. It took sponsorship from Gainbridge, Konica Minolta and EVERFi, which is working to develop the curriculum to continue the program, to launch it in IMSA.",
      "The students made four stops at the track: Tires, Traction and Tread to learn about physics and engineering at the Michelin Tire Center; Data-Driven Racing at the IMSA Engineering Center to learn about data, science and technology; Engineering Safety at IMSA Tech Inspection Area to learn about material science; and IMSA Technology Lab, with the IMSA GTP Hybrid Electrified Race Car, at Action Express Racing to learn about physics and engineering.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is a laboratory. It\u2019s a laboratory for the automakers. It\u2019s a laboratory for Michelin on the tire front. It\u2019s a laboratory for all these teams,\u201d Doonan said. \"For the students to be able to see what they\u2019re doing in the classroom, be applied in a real-world environment, that gives me and all of my IMSA teammates a lot of satisfaction.",
      "\"These students here, some of the top students from the Volusia County schools surrounding the Daytona area, they\u2019re our future. We are going to do it at five other races this year and then have a web portal to allow the educators and students to follow up. For me it\u2019s the best of both worlds.\u201d",
      "Doonan in his morning remarks to the students tried to prep them for what they were about to learn concerning STEM and motorsports.",
      "\u201cI told them, \u2018Look, algebra, calculus, physics, chemistry, as much as you may dislike it at the moment, it\u2019s being applied here real-time,\u2019\u201d Doonan said. \u201cAnd when you say that to the students, the teachers all raise their hand and cheer and tell them \u2018I told you so!\u2019 And then the opposite side, I think, once the web portal gets established by EVERFI, the teachers are going to be able to leverage this resource in story problems and race strategy and aerodynamics, potentially, ride height, all the things that the teams are doing.\u201d",
      "Amy Monahan, a K-12 STEM Specialist for Volusia County Schools, said the students who attended were selected by their teachers for \u201cshowing tenacity in what they do on a daily basis.\u201d One of the students said prior to Friday he'd been thinking of enlisting in the military after high school but now wonders if there might be something in motorsports he can pursue.",
      "\u201cThis whole program is educating them to many opportunities are out there and this one is in your backyard. Some of them think the military or trade jobs are all that is available to them,\" Monahan said. \u201cThey don't know.

      "New research shows that the mutation is, surprisingly, harmless for decades. But it quietly grows into a larger mutation \u2014 until it eventually crosses a threshold, generates toxic proteins, and kills the cells it has expanded in.",
      "\u201cThe conundrum in our field has been: Why do you have a genetic disorder that manifests later in life if the gene is present at conception?\u201d said Dr. Mark Mehler, who directs the Institute for Brain Disorders and Neural Regeneration at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and was not involved in the research. He called the research a \u201clandmark\u201d study and said \"it addresses a lot of the issues that have plagued the field for a long time.\u201d",
      "The brain cell death eventually leads to problems with movement, thinking and behavior. Huntington\u2019s symptoms \u2013 which include involuntary movement, unsteady gait, personality changes and impaired judgment \u2013 typically begin between the ages of 30 and 50, gradually worsening over 10 to 25 years.",
      "Scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, McLean Hospital in Massachusetts and Harvard Medical School studied brain tissue donated by 53 people with Huntington\u2019s and 50 without it, analyzing half a million cells.",
      "They focused on the Huntington\u2019s mutation, which involves a stretch of DNA in a particular gene where a three-letter sequence \u2013 CAG \u2013 is repeated at least 40 times. In people without the disease this sequence is repeated just 15 to 35 times. They discovered that DNA tracts with 40 or more such \u201crepeats\u201d expand over time until they are hundreds of CAGs long. Once CAGs reach a threshold of about 150, certain types of neurons sicken and die.",
      "The findings \u201cwere really surprising, even to us,\u201d said Steve McCarroll, a Broad member and co-senior author of the study, which was published Thursday in the journal Cell. The study was partly funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, an organization that also supports The Associated Press Health and Science department.",
      "The research team estimated that repeat tracts grow slowly during the first two decades of life, then the rate accelerates dramatically when they reach about 80 CAGs.",
      "\u201cThe longer the repeats, the earlier in life the onset will happen,\u201d said neuroscience researcher Sabina Berretta, one of the study's senior authors.",
      "Researchers acknowledged that some scientists were initially skeptical when results were shared at conferences, since previous work found that repeat expansions in the range of 30 to 100 CAGs were necessary \u2014 but not sufficient \u2014 to cause Huntington\u2019s. McCarroll agreed that 100 or fewer CAGs are not sufficient to trigger the disease, but said his study found that expansions with at least 150 CAGs are.",
      "Researchers hope their findings can help scientists come up with ways to delay or prevent the incurable condition, which afflicts about 41,000 Americans and is now treated with medications to manage the symptoms.",
      "Recently, experimental drugs designed to lower levels of the protein produced by the mutated Huntington's gene have struggled in trials. The new findings suggest that's because few cells have the toxic version of the protein at any given time.",
      "Slowing or stopping the expansion of DNA repeats may be a better way to target the disease, researchers said.",
      "Though there are no guarantees this would stave off Huntington\u2019s, McCarroll said \u201cmany companies are starting or expanding programs to try to do this.\u201d",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- U.S. defense contractor Anduril Industries is preparing to build a massive advanced manufacturing facility in central Ohio, adding a planned 4,000 jobs to the area's burgeoning high-tech sector, state officials announced Thursday.",
      "The Cosa Mesa, California-based defense technology company plans to begin construction of what it's calling \u201cArsenal 1\u201d as soon as state and local approvals are secured. The 5 million-square-foot (464,515-square-meter) facility will be located on a 500-acre (202-hectare) site near Rickenbacker International Airport in rural Pickaway County, about 16 miles (26 kilometers) southeast of Columbus.",
      "Production of military drones and autonomous air vehicles would begin in July 2026 under the plan, said Christian Brose, Anduril's chief strategy officer.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said it is the largest single job creation and payroll project that Ohio has announced. The governor said winning Anduril's manufacturing plant marks a continuation of Ohio's history of advanced advanced aviation, which began with the Wright brothers and continues to grow surrounding the Dayton-area Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.",
      "\u201cWe are an aerospace state,\u201d DeWine said. He called Ohio \u201cthe brains of the Air Force.\u201d",
      "DeWine, Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and JobsOhio CEO J.P. Nauseef said that, through targeted economic development efforts, the state boasts a strong and diverse aerospace workforce. They said it also has a network of job training centers, colleges and universities prepared to educate new advanced manufacturing workers. Those helped attract the nationally-competitive deal, they said.",
      "\u201cOhio has literally built a strategy around this kind of project, and so we are perfect for them,\" Husted said.",
      "The aerospace sector in Ohio includes the global headquarters of GE Aerospace and a new Joby Aviation manufacturing facility near Dayton that's preparing to manufacture electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft beginning this year.",
      "Anduril casts the Ohio facility as integral to its goal to \u201cRebuild the Arsenal\u201d of U.S. military weapons and platforms by \u201chyperscaling\u201d manufacturing with advanced software and production technologies.",
      "The latest development adds to what is becoming known as a \u201csilicon corridor\u201d based in Ohio. It includes Intel, which is building a $20 billion chip factory just east of the Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea, which are building a $3.5 billion battery plant in nearby Fayette County that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub. Ohio State University also announced plans in 2023 to build a $110 million software innovation center to dovetail with those efforts.",
      "At separate upcoming state meetings, the Anduril project will pursue a job creation tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $70 million infusion from the All Ohio Future Fund, which the DeWine administration and lawmakers established to help local governments prepare sites for economic development projects. JobsOhio also plans to provide the project a sizeable grant, whose exact amount will be announced once agreements are signed, as well as talent acquisition services.",

      "Years in the making with heavy funding by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the 320-foot (98-meter) rocket carried an an experimental platform designed to host satellites or release them into their proper orbits.",
      "All seven main engines fired at liftoff as the rocket blazed through the predawn sky to the delight of spectators lining nearby beaches. Bezos took part in the action from Mission Control and Blue Origin employees erupted in cheers once the craft successfully reached orbit 13 minutes later, a feat that drew praise from SpaceX's Elon Musk.",
      "The first-stage booster missed its landing on a barge in the Atlantic, but the company stressed that the more important goal was achieved. Bezos said before the flight it was \u201ca little crazy\u201d to even try to land the booster on the first try.",

      "Efforts to ban students' cellphones at school is gaining rare bipartisan consensus in Republican and Democrat-led states",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Arkansas' Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom have little in common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an idea that's been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states: Students' cellphones need to be banned during the school day.",
      "At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years, and proposals are being considered in several more states this year.",
      "Here is a look at the push by states for such bans.",
      "The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the impact screen time has on children\u2019s mental health and complaints from teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the classroom.",
      "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people\u2019s lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free times.",
      "Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them.",
      "Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile devices.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,\u201d she said.",
      "At least eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia \u2014 have enacted measures banning or restricting students\u2019 use of cellphones in schools.",
      "The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media on district Wi-Fi.",
      "A 2024 California law requires the state\u2019s nearly 1,000 school districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026.",
      "Several other states haven't banned phones, but have encouraged school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to store phones during the day.",
      "Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 schools signed on. In her state of the state address this week, Sanders proposed an outright ban.",
      "\u201cWe will ban cellphones in our schools, bell to bell, so that our kids are not distracted, in class or out of it,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has suggested she'll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered specifics.",
      "The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of emergency.",
      "Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last time.",
      "But supporters of the bans have noted that students' phones could pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or by revealing their location during an active shooter situation.",
      "Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating transportation.",
      "Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she agrees about the dangers of social media on children but that the bans sought by states are taking too broad of an approach. Banning the devices during the school day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers of social media, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the skills they need to actually navigate this technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe've just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of the pool when they're by themselves after school.\u201d",

      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery in southern Britain shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage",
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\u201cThat was really jaw-dropping \u2013 it\u2019s never been observed before in European prehistory,\u201d said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2013 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \u201cit\u2019s your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife\u2019s family for land and livelihood,\u201d said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2013 called matrilocality \u2013 is historically rare.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2013 women leaving their homes to join their husband\u2019s family group \u2013 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives\u2019 extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2013 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2013 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain\u2019s Celtic society \u201cmore egalitarian than the Roman world,\u201d said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

      "The two landers rocketed away in the middle of the night from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, the latest in a stream of private spacecraft aiming for the moon. They shared the ride to save money but parted company an hour into the flight exactly as planned, taking separate roundabout routes for the monthslong journey.",
      "It\u2019s take 2 for the Tokyo-based ispace, whose first lander crashed into the moon two years ago. This time, it has a rover on board with a scoop to gather up lunar dirt for study and plans to test potential food and water sources for future explorers.",
      "Lunar newcomer Texas-based Firefly Aerospace is flying 10 experiments for NASA, including a vacuum to gather dirt, a drill to measure the temperature below the surface and a device that could be used by future moonwalkers to keep the sharp, abrasive particles off their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a species of U.S. Southeastern fireflies \u2014 should reach the moon first. The 6-foot-6-inches-tall (2-meter-tall) lander will attempt a touchdown in early March at Mare Crisium, a volcanic plain in the northern latitudes.",
      "The slightly bigger ispace lander named Resilience will take four to five months to get there, targeting a touchdown in late May or early June at Mare Frigoris, even farther north on the moon\u2019s near side.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a race. Some people say \u2018race to the moon,\u2019 but it\u2019s not about the speed,\u201d ispace\u2019s founder CEO Takeshi Hakamada said this week from Cape Canaveral.",
      "Both Hakamada and Firefly CEO Jason Kim acknowledge the challenges still ahead, given the wreckage littering the lunar landscape. Only five countries have successfully placed spacecraft on the moon since the 1960s: the former Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can on the design and the engineering,\u201d Kim said. Even so, he pinned an Irish shamrock to his jacket lapel Tuesday night for good luck.",
      "The U.S. remains the only one to have landed astronauts. NASA\u2019s Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, aims to get astronauts back on the moon by the end of the decade.",
      "Before that can happen, \u201cwe\u2019re sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\u201d NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox said on the eve of launch.",
      "If acing their respective touchdowns, both spacecraft will spend two weeks operating in constant daylight, shutting down once darkness hits.",
      "Once lowered onto the lunar surface, ispace\u2019s 11-pound (5-kilogram) rover will stay near the lander, traveling up to hundreds of yards (meters) in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. The rover has its own special delivery to drop off on the lunar dust: a toy-size red house designed by a Swedish artist.",
      "NASA is paying $101 million to Firefly for the mission and another $44 million for the experiments. Hakamada declined to divulge the cost of ispace\u2019s rebooted mission with six experiments, saying it's less than the first mission that topped $100 million.",
      "Coming up by the end of February is the second moonshot for NASA by Houston-based Intuitive Machines. Last year, the company achieved the first U.S. lunar touchdown in more than a half-century, landing sideways near the south pole but still managing to operate.",

      "Trump is expected to further direct the incoming attorney general to move to dismiss all pending indictments against Jan. 6 defendants who have not yet had their cases fully adjudicated, which would shutter roughly 470 ongoing cases, according to recently released numbers by the District of Columbia U.S. Attorney's Office.",
      "Current and former DOJ officials have expressed alarm over the potential that Trump would hand down pardons -- or otherwise free -- violent offenders, citing the potential risk they could seek to target the prosecutors who oversaw their cases, the judges who sentenced them to periods of incarceration, or witnesses who may have testified against them.",

      "Of the nearly 1,600 individuals have faced charges associated with the Capitol attack, according to figures released by the U.S. Attorney's Office, 608 individuals have faced charges for assaulting, resisting or interfering with law enforcement trying to protect the complex that day, the office said. Approximately 140 law enforcement officers were injured during the riot, the DOJ has said.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office said it is evaluating whether to bring charges in roughly 200 cases that have been referred to them by the FBI, about 60 of which involve potential felony charges involving allegations of assault or impeding law enforcement.",

      "Trump\u2019s executive actions are expected to rescind Biden administration policies.",

      "\u201cIt is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These are sexes that are not changeable, and they are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,\u201d an incoming White House official said during the call, which took place ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive actions are expected to rescind 2023 Biden administration policies related to the treatment of transgender individuals in the federal workplace.",
      "Policies include Biden administration guidance on gender and inclusion for public servants, which was issued on March 31, 2023, marking Trans Visibility Day, in which the Office of Personnel Management updated guidance on gender inclusion in the federal workplace, including ensuring that \u201call federal employees have their respective gender identities accurately reflected and identified in the workplace.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration guidance also directed federal agencies to \u201ctake steps to implement or increase the availability of training programs on gender identity and inclusion in the federal workplace for employees, managers, and leadership.\u201d",

      "In addition, entities like prisons and shelters that receive federal funds would also be required to designate \u201csingle sex\u201d spaces, White House officials said, assigning people to certain areas based on their gender assigned at birth.",

      "The move, which was designed to accommodate nonbinary, intersex and gender nonconforming individuals, was announced by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken on March 31, 2022, marking Transgender Day of Visibility.",

    "published": "Mon, 20 Jan 2025 15:42:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump promises to sign executive actions to address immigration and border security. Some will likely spark legal battles.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cThis is about national security,\" said an incoming official.",
      "On a call with reporters on Inauguration Day morning, incoming White House officials previewed a series of executive orders and other actions they said the incoming Trump administration plans to take to address immigration and U.S. border issues.",
      "\"We will protect the American people against invasion,\" one of the incoming officials said during the call. \"This is about national security. This is about public safety. And this is about the victims of some of the most violent, abusive criminals we've seen enter our country in our lifetime. And it ends today.\"",
      "Many of the proposed executive orders revealed on Monday's call require help from international partners like Mexico and would almost certainly spark legal battles.",
      "Although one of the incoming officials said that the call would \"preview a series of actions to be taken today,\" it was not clear from the call, during which officials took very few questions from reporters, that everything about which they spoke would actually happen Monday.",
      "Here's a look at some of the promised executive actions:",
      "The incoming administration will be declaring a national emergency at the southern border. This will allow DoD to deploy armed forces to the region and free up resources to build a wall and other barriers there, as he promised to do during his first administration.",
      "\"What this action does is it deploys armed forces, erects physical barriers by directing DOD and DHS secretaries to finish the wall along the border, and allows for counter-UAS capabilities near the southern border in addition,\" an incoming White House official said.",
      "It's not totally clear what the official meant by \"counter-UAS capabilities,\" but it is important to note that since at least the Obama administration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has used drones and other UAS (unmanned aircraft systems) to help conduct surveillance of the southwest border.",
      "The secretary of defense will be directed to deploy armed troops as well as the National Guard to the border, according to the call. In response to a follow-up question, an incoming White House official was unable to say how many troops will be deployed, responding that the decision \"is going to be up to the secretary of defense.\"",
      "This executive order aims to allow the military to \"prioritize our borders and territorial integrity,\" an incoming White House official said during the call. The official further said that the order will direct the military to plan operations to maintain territorial integrity by \"repelling forms of invasion including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and other criminal activities.\"",
      "In addition to creating federal and state partnerships to help enforce immigration policies and deportation priorities, this executive order would also aim to end the practice of \"catch and release,\" and mandates building a wall along the southern U.S. border.",
      "Though often used pejoratively, \"catch and release\" describes the practice of releasing undocumented immigrants after they've been processed at the U.S. border and while they await immigration hearings in court. The term originated during the George W. Bush administration and describes a practice that has been implemented during every administration since, including Donald Trump's first administration.",
      "Because it's logistically impossible to safely detain migrants indefinitely, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other authorities release some migrants into the community to wait out their legal proceedings.",
      "Remain in Mexico is a policy implemented during the first Trump administration that required some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico, rather than in the U.S., as their petitions were processed in U.S. courts. This action would require Mexico's cooperation, which incoming White House officials did not address during Monday's call.",
      "Trump also promised during his first presidential campaign to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and signed an executive order to that end days after assuming office. Few new sections of barrier along the border were erected during his administration, though many sections of damaged or outdated barriers were repaired or replaced.",
      "The incoming administration will sign an executive order to designate drug cartels and other criminal organizations, including the U.S.-El Salvadoran-based MS-13 and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, as foreign terrorist organizations or specifically designated global terrorists (SDGT).",
      "An incoming White House official said Monday that the order will direct authorities to specifically remove members of Tren de Agua from the United States. And, citing the Alien Enemies Act enacted more than two centuries ago, the official said Tren de Agua has become an \"irregular armed force of Venezuela's government conducting a predatory incursion and invasion into the United States.\"",
      "The incoming White House official said the Trump administration is going to \"end asylum and close the border to illegals via proclamation.\" Essentially, this means undocumented migrants caught between ports of entry will not be able to claim asylum, which in turn will \"create an immediate removal process without possibility of asylum,\" the incoming official said.",
      "Like other executive orders announced Monday, this one would possibly face legal hurdles for several reasons. Current laws allow asylum seekers the ability to attempt to request asylum or protection once they enter the country, regardless of if they crossed between ports of entry. This has been the basis for several legal battles against some of the more recent asylum restrictions that the Biden administration implemented in June 2024.",
      "The incoming official said during Monday's call that the incoming Trump administration also plans to suspend refugee resettlements for at least four months.",
      "An incoming officials on Monday's call said \"We are then going to end birthright citizenship. This action gives effect to the phrase 'and subject to the jurisdiction thereof' in the 14th Amendment to clarify that \u2026 the federal government will not recognize automatic birthright citizenship for children of illegal aliens born in the United States.\"",
      "It was unclear from Monday's call whether ending birthright citizenship will be part of the day's announcements or will come later. Trump made the same promise during his first term in office.",
      "The incoming official said Monday that the new administration is also going to \"enhance vetting and screening of illegal aliens\" and direct agencies to provide recommendations to the president for suspending entry for migrants from \"countries of particular concern.\"",
      "To help target gang members, criminals and other undocumented migrants, the new administration is planning to establish \"federal homeland security task forces\" so federal, state and local law enforcement can cooperate further in removing them.",
      "According to the incoming official, the new administration plans to \"restore the death penalty in public safety\" by directing the attorney general to seek capital punishment when an undocumented immigrant murders a law enforcement officer or commits other capital crimes. The new administration will also encourage state attorneys general and district attorneys to also pursue the death penalty in such cases, according to the incoming official.",

      "\"This ideology is rooted in the pernicious and false belief that America is an irredeemably racist and sexist country,\" the executive order said, adding that DEI training \"perpetuates racial stereotypes and division and can use subtle coercive pressure to ensure conformity of viewpoint.\"",
      "Outgoing President Joe Biden signaled his support for DEI initiatives on his first day in office, signing an executive order that \"emphasized the enormous human costs of systemic racism, persistent poverty, and other disparities,\" and \"directed the federal government to advance an ambitious, whole-of-government equity agenda that matches the scale of the challenges we face as a country and the opportunities we have to build a more perfect union.\"",

      "The portrait was unveiled on Friday, Jan. 10, at a ceremony in that hallway, with both Milley and then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin present. The portrait's disappearance was first noted by reporters at the Pentagon who observed the empty space where the portrait hung just a few hours before. It is not clear why the portrait was removed from the hallway, but ABC News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Milley, who was preemptively pardoned on Monday by then-President Joe Biden as part of a last-minute slate of pardons, retired as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2023.

      "\"My family and I are deeply grateful for the President's action today,\" he said. \"After forty-three years of faithful service in uniform to our Nation, protecting and defending the Constitution, I do not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights.

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's inaugural benediction on the federal holiday that celebrates Martin Luther King Jr. included an homage to the civil rights leader's legacy. The prayer by a Michigan pastor heavily cited King's seminal \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech alongside the Declaration of Independence, patriotic songs and gospel hymns.",
      "In his spirited roughly three-minute invocation on Monday, Rev. Lorenzo Sewell thanked God for the incoming Trump administration and prayed \u201cthat America would begin to dream again.\u201d",
      "The comments were at times a near complete rendition of King\u2019s 1963 address. He asked God to \u201clet freedom ring\u201d nationwide and ensure that Americans are \u201cfree at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.\u201d",
      "Sewell was a mainstay of Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. He hosted Trump at his church in June, spoke at the Republican National Convention in July, and attended numerous campaign roundtables of faith leaders and pro-Trump conservative Christian rallies.",
      "Sewell said during a Sunday night inaugural gala that Trump had personally asked him to pray during the inauguration.",
      "\u201cHeavenly father, we are so grateful that you gave our 45th and now our 47th president a millimeter miracle,\u201d Sewell said Monday, referencing the July attempt on Trump\u2019s life.",
      "Here is more about Sewell and the reaction to his benediction:",

      "Sewell adheres to a charismatic, conservative Christian doctrine and does not shy away from politics in his ministry.",
      "\u201cThe gospel message is a political message. The Bible is a political book, from Genesis to Revelations. We see that the Bible is a political book,\u201d Sewell told Fox News in January. \u201cIt is impossible to be politically neutral.\"",
      "At the Black Conservative Federation\u2019s Legacy of Freedom Ball on Sunday night, Sewell invoked Bible verses and gospel hymns as he prayed for Trump's protection.",
      "\u201cWould you put angels around him, angels that excel in strength, warring angels and ministering angels and flames of fire. And we decree and declare tonight that no weapon formed against him shall prosper,\u201d Sewell said.",
      "Shortly after delivering his energetic benediction, Sewell posted on social media that he had launched a cryptocurrency and he encouraged followers to buy it to support his charitable activities. Other major rightwing figures, including Trump, have recently launched cryptocurrencies.",
      "Monday's ceremony was the third time a presidential inauguration has coincided with Martin Luther King Day in the nearly 40 years since its enactment as a federal holiday. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were also inaugurated for their second terms on the holiday.",
      "Trump referenced King in his remarks.",
      "\"To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records and I will not forget it. I\u2019ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come,\" Trump said.",
      "\"Today is Martin Luther King Day, and his honor \u2014 this will be a great honor \u2014 but in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true,\" Trump declared.",
      "He said he intends to \u201cend the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life\u201d and promised to \u201cforge a society that is colorblind and merit based.\u201d",
      "King's family observed the holiday with a day of service and prayer, but references to the new administration were evident throughout. During proceedings at the King Center in Atlanta, Rev. William Barber III rejected the idea that Trump has the right to carry out the most sweeping parts of his agenda.",
      "\u201cYou never win a mandate to violate justice. You never win a mandate to hurt people with your power,\u201d Barber said. \u201cWe come today to remember Dr. King but more so to commit ourselves to the spirit,\u201d he continued, praying \u201cthat every day we\u2019ve got life in our bodies, to tell America who she is supposed to be.\u201d",
      "Civil rights leaders, including King\u2019s family, said before the inauguration that they were unsettled by the juxtaposition of Trump\u2019s return to the White House and the King holiday.",
      "But many, including King\u2019s youngest daughter Dr. Bernice King, urged those who want to carry out King\u2019s vision to watch the inaugural address. Major civil rights organizations have adopted a wait-and-see approach to Trump\u2019s second term, even as many privately prepared for him to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion policies, social programs and civil rights laws.",
      "\"For some, today\u2019s inauguration represents the best of time: Make America great again. And for others, it highlights the worst of times: Set America back again. For some, today\u2019s King holiday represents a day to champion freedom, justice and democracy. For others, it\u2019s a day to decry DEI, disavow a legacy of peace, love and justice and distort the meaning of King\u2019s words,\" she said.",
      "\"But regardless of how this day shows up for you, we must remember the mission and be in pursuit of it,\" King continued.",
      "The holiday proceedings took place in Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the late King once presided. The senior of that church was not present for the sermons and day of service. Rev. Raphael Warnock, who also serves as a senator for Georgia in Congress, was in Washington observing the inaugural proceedings.",
      "Sewell's prayer received widespread praise from GOP lawmakers, conservative activists and the president's rank-and-file supporters online and in the Capitol One Arena where a rally for the president took place concurrently with events at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "But some Black faith leaders and civil rights figures expressed unease at Sewell's prayer and Trump's references to King.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let them hijack what Dr. King was about,\u201d said the Rev. Al Sharpton. \u201cDr. King was a fighter. Dr. King used economic leverage. Dr. King was a man who stood up for economic justice,\" Sharpton argued. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t celebrate Dr. King without celebrating what he stood for.\u201d"

      "Musk, standing just a few feet away, grinned widely and pumped his fists in the air.",
      "The moment sharply illustrated the unusual partnership the billionaire tech titan, who has lucrative contracts with the federal government, has established with the incoming president.",
      "The blossoming relationship was on full display throughout the inaugural ceremonies. Musk heaped praise on Trump during a rally shortly after the swearing-in, repeating Trump's promise of a coming \u201cgolden age\u201d for the country.",
      "\u201cIt is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured,\u201d Musk told the crowd at Capital One Arena.",
      "On his social media platform X, Musk posted his approval of Trump returning to power for a second term: \u201cThe Return of the King.\"",
      "During the inauguration inside the Capitol Rotunda, Musk was seated in a row that included other tech giants, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. All were seated behind Trump's wife, Melania, and children, though Musk was seated closest to Trump.",
      "Shortly after Trump's youngest son, Barron, arrived at his seat in the second row, he turned and shook hands with Musk, who was visible in the televised shot of the podium throughout much of the proceedings. The treatment follows a hearty embrace by Trump of Musk, the Tesla owner and world's wealthiest person.",
      "Musk contributed roughly $200 million to America PAC, a super political action committee that worked to organize Trump support last fall.",
      "The proximity of so many of the world's wealthiest people to Trump's incoming government led former President Joe Biden to warn of a burgeoning U.S. oligarchy of tech billionaires.",
      "Among the projects Trump has assigned Musk is to work with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy on an effort known as the Department of Government Efficiency. The mandate of the advisory group, which operates outside the formal government, is to slash federal bureaucracy, regulations and spending, a target Musk set last year at $2 trillion, roughly the size of the deficit.",
      "Cuts of that scale would likely require targeting entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, as well as laying off hundreds of thousands of federal employees. Though still bullish on the prospect for deep cuts, Musk noted during a public forum earlier this month that the $2 trillion target might be difficult to achieve.",
      "\u201cI think if you try for $2 trillion, I think we can get to 1 (trillion),\u201d Musk said during a question-and-answer session on X with pollster Mark Penn.",
      "Since the election, Musk has been a regular visitor to Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and has been part of calls and meetings with prospects for Cabinet positions and world leaders.",
      "He also is credited with helping scuttle a bipartisan government funding proposal last month, in part by posting false claims on X, where he has over 200 million followers. The platform has largely abandoned guardrails against misinformation and has experienced a surge in conspiracy theories and bogus claims since Musk bought what was then Twitter nearly three years ago. That has raised concerns about how it could be used to manipulate public perception given its owner's ties to the Trump administration.",
      "During his rally speech later at the arena, Musk could hardly contain his enthusiasm.",
      "\u201cMan, I can\u2019t wait,\" he said. \"This is going to be fantastic.\u201d",

      "Trump, who took office for a second time Monday, said he planned to \u201crestore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.\u201d Trump also announced plans to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.",

      "A prospector in 1896 dubbed the peak \u201cMount McKinley\u201d after President William McKinley, who had never been to Alaska. The name was formally recognized by the U.S. government until Obama changed it \u2014 in spite of opposition from lawmakers in McKinley\u2019s home state of Ohio.",

      "The Tanana Chiefs Conference, a consortium of Athabascan tribes in Interior Alaska, spent years advocating for the peak to be recognized as Denali.",
      "McKinley, a Republican native of Ohio, was the 25th president. He was assassinated early in his second term in 1901.",
      "Alaska and Ohio had been at odds over the name since at least the 1970s. Alaska had a standing request to change the name since 1975, when the legislature passed a resolution and then-Gov. Jay Hammond appealed to the federal government."

      "In the quest to make apple trees more resilient in a warming climate, some researchers in Michigan are looking for a late bloomer",
      "In the quest to make apple trees more resilient in a warming climate, some Michigan researchers are looking for a late bloomer.",
      "A native Michigan apple tree, the Malus coronaria, learned to fight frost by blooming two or three weeks later than the trees that produce cultivated varieties of apples like Honeycrisp or Red Delicious.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but almost always that\u2019s enough for the flowers to escape the killing spring frost,\u201d said Steve van Nocker, a Michigan State University professor and plant geneticist.",
      "Van Nocker wants to identify the genes responsible for the Malus coronaria\u2019s delayed blooms and use them to develop more frost-resistant apple varieties, a decades-long process. But first, he\u2019s hiking through forests, trying to find the elusive trees.",
      "Van Nocker\u2019s project is one of many ways researchers and growers are trying to make apples more resilient as climate change makes weather less predictable.",
      "In Europe and South Korea, growers are experimenting with solar panels in vineyards and orchards. The panels protect fruit from hail and sun damage but also let in light and heat when necessary, said Jared Buono, the director of Cornell University\u2019s Hudson Valley Research Lab. Buono\u2019s lab is also adding solar panels to its experimental orchard.",
      "University of Maryland researchers recently announced the development of a more heat-tolerant apple variety. At Penn State University, a team built an unmanned vehicle with a propane-fueled heater that can roll through an orchard and automatically warm trees.",
      "Buono said such efforts can mitigate the impact of unusual weather like a May 18, 2023 frost that damaged trees across New York state and cut apple production by 20%.",
      "\u201cGrowers\u2019 jobs are already hard,\u201d Buono said. \u201cThe change in climate, the increased unpredictability and variability, makes it that much harder.\u201d",
      "According to a Washington State University study published this month, major apple-growing counties in the top three U.S. apple-producing states -- Washington, Michigan and New York -- are seeing fewer cold days and more warm fall nights than they used to. Washington also is experiencing more extreme heat.",
      "The study, which examined climate data from 1979 to 2022, said the temperature trends could alter bloom timing, bring trees out of dormancy too early and increase the risk of sunburn, which hurts the appearance and quality of apples.",
      "That\u2019s why, on a chilly day in December, van Nocker and graduate assistant Lily \u201cKaz\u201d Christian hiked through a public park near Michigan State to check on a handful of Malus coronaria trees they had found there.",
      "Malus coronaria \u2013 also called sweet crabapple -- was once so common in Michigan its blossoms were designated as the state flower in 1897. But the species appears to be in decline, van Nocker said. Parking lots and shopping centers now stand in many of the places where the tree was documented in the past, and the remaining trees often produce little new growth or fruit.",
      "When they reached the trees, van Nocker and Christian cut off small pieces of the stems. The snippets will be tested to ensure they are fully Malus coronaria and not a hybrid. Then, these Malus coronaria cuttings \u2014 along with cuttings from previous hunts \u2014 will be grafted onto an apple rootstock. That will allow them to grow into trees which are identical to the original.",
      "However, the goal is not to replace popular varieties like Fuji or Honeycrisp with Malus coronaria apples, since the Michigan tree's fruit is small, green and bitter.",
      "\u201cTo me, they don\u2019t taste good at all,\u201d van Nocker said.",
      "Instead, he wants to identify the genes that cause late blooming and create a genetic stock that breeders could use to develop commercial apples. Van Nocker also is sending seeds to the U.S. Department of Agriculture so the genetic stock won\u2019t be lost if the tree continues to decline.",
      "Making a later-blooming commercial apple could take decades. If a Malus coronaria is crossed with a commercial apple tree to make a new hybrid, it would take four or five years for that tree to start producing apples. Crossbreeding would continue until researchers developed an apple with the desired traits of both varieties.",
      "But van Nocker said it\u2019s critical to try.",
      "\u201cWith climate change, it\u2019s quite possible that apples won\u2019t be able to be produced in Michigan in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why cultivar improvement, especially in terms of frost resistance, is so important.\u201d",

      "Sala, deprived of news from the outside world, assumed she would have been held for much longer, given other Western prisoners have been held for over a year or more. She said she also feared Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House could have meant a much longer detention, because of regional tensions between Israel and Iran.",

      "But crypto has so far defied naysayers and survived multiple prolonged price drops in its short lifespan. Wealthy players in the crypto industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump win last November\u2019s election. Bitcoin has surged in price since Trump's victory, topping $100,000 for the first time last month before briefly sliding down to about $90,000. On Friday, it rose about 5%. It jumped more than $9,000 early Monday, according to CoinDesk.",

      "At last year\u2019s bitcoin conference, Trump told crypto supporters that new regulations \u201cwill be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry.\u201d Trump's pick to lead the SEC, Paul Atkins, has been a strong advocate for cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto investors and companies chafed as what they said was a hostile Biden administration that went overboard in unfair enforcement actions and accounting policies that have stifled innovation in the industry \u2014 particularly at the hands of outgoing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.",
      "\u201cAs far as general expectations from the Trump Administration, I think one of the best things to bet on is a tone change at the SEC,\u201d said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the executive director of the advocacy group Coin Center.",

At the bitcoin conference earlier this summer, Trump said it the U.S. government would keep, rather than auction off, the billions of dollars in bitcoin it has seized through law enforcement actions.",
      "Crypto advocates have posted a draft executive order online that would establish a \u201cStrategic Bitcoin Reserve\u201d as a \u201cpermanent national asset\u201d to be administered by the Treasury Department through its Exchange Stabilization Fund. The draft order calls for the Treasury Department to eventually hold at least $21 billion in bitcoin.",
      "Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has proposed legislation mandating the U.S. government stockpile bitcoin, which advocates said would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks. Critics say bitcoin\u2019s volatility make it a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Creating such a stockpile would also be a \u201cgiant step in the direction of bitcoin becoming normalized, becoming legitimatized in the eyes of people who don\u2019t yet see it as legitimate,\u201d said Zack Shapiro, an attorney who is head of policy at the Bitcoin Policy Institute.",
      "At the bitcoin conference earlier this year, Trump received loud cheers when he reiterated a promise to commute the life sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the convicted founder of the drug-selling website Silk Road that used crypto for payments.",

      "BOSTON -- Residents across the country from the Northern Plains to the tip of Maine are bracing for dangerously low temperatures as tens of millions of residents along the East Coast contend with a thick blanket of snow \u2014 and more snowfall in the forecast.",
      "Winter storm warnings issued by the National Weather Service were in effect for parts of the Mid-Atlantic through Monday morning, and warnings began in New England on Sunday afternoon. Heavy lake-effect snow was expected in western New York state Monday through Wednesday morning, with 2 to 3 feet (about 60 to 90 centimeters) possible in some areas including Oswego along Lake Ontario.",
      "Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland, projected that as many as 70 million residents will be under some kind of winter storm warning in the coming days.",
      "Sunday snowfall was just the start of a chaotic week of weather. Much of the Eastern Seaboard will be enduring some of the coldest temperatures this winter.",
      "An area from the Rockies into the Northern Plains will see colder than normal weather over several days, with temperatures forecast to drop to between minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 34 degrees Celsius) to minus 55 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 48 degrees Celsius) on Monday. Sub-zero wind chills are forecast to reach as far south as Oklahoma and the Tennessee Valley.",
      "Minnesota residents were urged to wear appropriate clothing and carry a survival kit for travel. Kristi Rollwagen, director of homeland security and emergency management at the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, also urged motorists to drive with a full tank of gas and a fully charged cellphone to keep in touch with loved ones.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not something we haven\u2019t experienced before, it\u2019s just a good reminder that it does get cold in Minnesota,\u201d Rollwagen said.",
      "Meanwhile, temperatures in Washington, D.C., are expected to dip into the 20s (about minus 7 C to minus 1 C) with wind gusts upwards of 30 mph (48 kph), Chenard said. The forecast prompted President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural ceremony to be moved inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.",
      "Like earlier this month, this latest cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole.",
      "The cold air will moderate as it moves southward and eastward, but the Central and Eastern U.S. will still experience temperatures in the teens and 20s Monday into Tuesday, Chenard said. The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast also will have highs in the teens and 20s, lows in the single digits and below zero degrees F (minus 18 C), and wind chills below zero.",
      "The colder temperatures will dip into the South early this week, where as many as 30 million people starting Monday could see a wintry mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. The unusual conditions are expected to stretch from Texas into northern Florida and the Carolinas. Impacts are expected starting Monday night in Texas and then spreading across the Gulf Coast and Southeast on Tuesday into Wednesday.",
      "Frigid air combined with a low-pressure system over the Gulf is behind the storm, which could bring heavy snow just south of the Interstate 20 corridor across northern Louisiana and into Mississippi and a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain near the Interstate 10 corridor from Houston to Mobile, Alabama.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry on Saturday issued a state of emergency ahead of the severe weather, urging residents to prepare and keep watch on the forecast.",

      "Southern Californians are bracing for gusty winds and a heightened risk of wildfires less than two weeks after deadly blazes that have killed at least 27 people and ravaged thousands of homes",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Southern Californians are bracing for gusty winds and a heightened risk of wildfires, less than two weeks after the outbreak of deadly blazes that have killed at least 27 people and charred thousands of homes.",
      "The National Weather Service has issued a warning of a \u201c particularly dangerous situation \u201d for parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties from Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning due to low humidity and damaging Santa Ana winds. Gusts could peak at 70 mph (113 kph) along the coast and 100 mph (160 kph) in the mountains and foothills.",
      "Windy weather and single-digit humidity are expected to linger through Thursday, said Rich Thompson, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. He said the fire risk is also elevated because the region hasn\u2019t seen rain since April.",
      "Critical fire weather with wind gusts up to 60 mph (97 kph) was also forecast for Southern California communities stretching to San Diego on Monday and Tuesday, with residents urged to take steps to get ready to evacuate such as creating an emergency kit and keeping cars filled with at least a half tank of gas. A windblown dust and ash advisory was also issued, as high winds could disperse ash from existing fire zones across Southern California.",
      "The warnings come as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area, the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have destroyed more than 14,000 structures since they broke out during fierce winds on Jan. 7. The Palisades fire was 52% contained on Sunday and the Eaton fire 81% contained, according to fire officials.",
      "Firefighters have made progress on the perimeter of the Palisades fire, which has blackened more than 37 square miles (96 square kilometers) near the Pacific coast, but there are areas in the interior that continue to burn, said Dan Collins, a spokesperson for the Palisades fire incident.",
      "\u201cThere is always a possibility in a red flag warning something hot, or some type of burning material from the interior, could be perhaps whipped up and blown across the containment lines,\u201d Collins said.",
      "While firefighters are fairly confident the Eaton fire further inland will remain contained, there are concerns a new fire could break out with vegetation especially dry for this time of year, said Carlos Herrera, an Eaton fire spokesperson.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has positioned fire engines, water-dropping aircraft and hand crews across the region to enable a quick response should a new fire break out, according to the governor's office of emergency services.",
      "\u201cThis proactive approach has proven to be a critical component of California\u2019s wildfire response strategy, reducing response times and containing fires before they escalate,\u201d the office said.",
      "Damage estimates have continued to climb for the Palisades and Eaton fires nearly two weeks since they began. Inspectors have fanned out to check buildings and assess damages, but Collins said it is impossible to know whether the remaining structures affected in the Palisades fire are intact.",
      "\u201cOur damage inspection teams have to inspect every structure within the fire perimeter,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey're about two-thirds of the way done.\u201d",
      "Fire officials said they were focused on repopulating evacuated areas, with residents allowed to return Sunday to the hillside area of Pacific Palisades known as the highlands.",
      "Authorities said two people were arrested Saturday while attempting to enter an evacuation zone for the Palisades fire and are being investigated for impersonating firefighters. The pair were wearing turnout gear and claimed to be from an Oregon fire agency, but they weren't, and the truck they were driving had been bought at auction, the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s department said in a statement."

      "Immigrants in large cities have been preparing for mass arrests since Trump won election in November, but reports that his initial push would be in the Chicago area has brought a new sense of urgency and fear.",
      "\u201cThey feel they have been targeted for who they are. They feel like they\u2019re reviving this fear they had eight years ago,\u201d said Sanchez of St. Rita of Cascia Parish on Chicago's South Side. \u201cThey\u2019re feeling like something is going to happen. This is not their city because of the threat.\u201d",

      "Plans for deportation arrests are in flux, but federal immigration officers will target more than 300 people with histories of egregious, violent crimes after Trump takes office Monday, one official said Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been made public.",
      "The operation will be concentrated in the Chicago area and continue all week, subject to potential weather delays, the official said. Temperatures in Chicago dipped to 6 degrees Fahrenheit (-14.4 degrees Celsius) with cold temperatures forecast throughout the week.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests a fraction of its targets in such operations, though Trump is expected to cast a wider net than President Joe Biden, whose focus on picking up people away from the border was largely limited to those with serious criminal histories or who pose a risk to national security. Biden's administration also ended the practice of mass worksite arrests, which were common under Trump, including a 2019 operation targeting Mississippi chicken plants.",
      "Trump aides have said they will arrest others, such as spouses or roommates, who are not targets but happen to be in the country illegally.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Saturday that mass deportations remain a top priority. He didn\u2019t give an exact date or city where they\u2019ll start, but he said they would begin soon.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll begin very early, very quickly,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t say which cities because things are evolving. And I don\u2019t think we want to say what city. You\u2019ll see it firsthand.\u201d",
      "Sanctuary cities, which limit how local police can cooperate with federal immigration agents, have been one of Trump's favorite targets \u2014 especially Chicago.",
      "The nation\u2019s third-largest city became a so-called sanctuary city in the 1980s and has beefed up its policies multiple times since, including after Trump first took office in 2017. Last week, the City Council heartily rejected a longshot plan calling for exceptions allowing local police to work with ICE agents on deportation cases for people accused or convicted of crimes.",
      "Trump's incoming so-called \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan blasted top Democratic leaders in the state during a visit to the Chicago area last month where he indicated enforcement would start there. But in recent days he told media outlets that plans were evolving.",
      "Homan told Fox News Sunday that Chicago was still on the table but that the new administration was \u201creconsidering when and how we do it.\u201d",

      "Immigrant rights advocates in Chicago rallied Saturday, including Democratic U.S. Reps. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia and Delia Ramirez. They urged immigrants in Chicago to remain calm and exercise their rights, particularly to remain silent and refuse to allow officers into their homes without warrants. Some advocacy groups have planned legal workshops anticipating mass arrests next week.",

      "Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in College Park Maryland, projected that as many as 70 million residents will be under some kind of winter storm hazards warning in the coming days including in New England and the Mid-Atlantic. Large cities like Philadelphia, New York and Boston could see several inches of snow this evening with the highest totals being outside of major cities.",
      "\u201cThere will certainly be some more hazardous road conditions anywhere from D.C. up the whole I-95 corridor and then inland from there later today and tonight,\u201d Chenard said. \u201cThen it gets quite cold behind that. By Monday morning, any roads that haven\u2019t been treated or cleared will still likely be some hazardous travel conditions.\u201d",
      "But the snow is just the start of a chaotic week of weather.",
      "Much of the Eastern half of the United States will be enduring some of the coldest temperatures this winter, if not for several years.",
      "An area from the Rockies into the Northern Plains will see colder than normal temperatures starting Sunday into the coming week, with temperatures dropping to minus 30 degrees F (minus 34 degrees C) to minus 55 F (minus 48 C) on Sunday and Monday. Wind chills of minus 40 F (minus 40 C) were already being clocked in parts of North Dakota and Minnesota. Sub-zero wind chills are forecast to reach as far south as Oklahoma and the Tennessee Valley.",
      "The cold weather forecasted for Monday for Washington, D.C., prompted President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural ceremony to be moved inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a cold day in Washington, D.C. on Monday. That's for sure,\u201d Chenard said, noting temperatures will be in the 20s with wind gust upwards of 30 mph (48 kph).",
      "As happened earlier this month, this latest cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole.",
      "The cold air will moderate as it moves southward and eastward, but the Central and Eastern U.S. will still be cold with highs in the teens and 20s on Monday into Tuesday, Chenard said. The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast also will have highs in the teens and 20s, lows in the single digits and below zero degrees F (minus 18 C) and wind chills below zero.",
      "The colder temperatures will reach down into the South early this week, where as many as 30 million people starting Monday could see a wintry mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. The unusual conditions are expected to stretch from Texas into northern Florida and the Carolinas. Impacts are expected to start in Texas on Monday night and spread across the Gulf Coast and Southeast on Tuesday into Wednesday.",
      "A combination of frigid air with a low pressure system over the Gulf are behind the storm, which could bring heavy snow just south of the Interstate 20 corridor across northern Louisiana and into Mississippi and a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain near the Interstate 10 corridor from Houston to Mobile, Alabama.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry on Saturday issued a state of emergency in advance of the wintry weather. He encouraged Louisianans to be prepared and to monitor the weather forecast.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump has launched a new cryptocurrency token that is soaring in value \u2013 and potentially boosting his net worth \u2013 just before his inauguration. It\u2019s the latest norm-defying promotion by Trump, who has also helped sell branded bibles, gold sneakers and diamond-encrusted watches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community,\u201d Trump said in a social post late Friday promoting the new tokens. They are marketed with a picture of Trump holding a fist up superimposed over the words \u201cFIGHT FIGHT FIGHT,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s response to an assassination attempt at a political rally in July.",

      "That hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying to make money. The Trump meme coins started selling for $10 each before soaring to as high as about $70 as of Sunday morning. It fell sharply later Sunday after Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, posted about a meme coin for her. The Melania coin was trading for around $5 Sunday afternoon.",
      "Meme coins are a strange and highly volatile corner of the crypto industry that often start as a joke with no real value but can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency whose mascot is a super-cute dog that muses things like \u201cmuch wow,\u201d is perhaps the most well known. Meme coins can be used by scammers looking to make a quick fortune at the expense of unwary investors.",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin\u2019s release, saying it\u2019s symbolic of the incoming president\u2019s support for an industry that felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. Trump has promised to usher in crypto-friendly regulations and picked crypto cheerleaders for key government positions.",

      "Trump and his family previously helped launch a new venture to trade cryptocurrencies last year. The president-elect has also dabbled in NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and last year reported earning between $100,000 and $1 million from a series of digital trading cards that portrayed him in cartoon-like images, including as an astronaut, a cowboy and a superhero.",
      "Trump's social media company, Truth Social, has also defied traditional notions of value. Despite struggling to raise revenue, the company is currently valued at more than $8 billion as Trump's supporters help boost the stock price and his net worth along with it.",

      "When Donald Trump arrived in Washington in 2017 on the eve of his first inauguration, he was a stranger to most in town",
      "NEW YORK -- When Donald Trump arrived in Washington in 2017 just before his first inauguration, he was a stranger to most in town. As the only president in history without prior experience in public office or the military, it was unclear how he would govern.",
      "Not this time.",
      "After four years in the Oval Office, the once and future president returns to power with know-how and a very different team. The political landscape has been transformed, with both chambers of Congress now filled with Republicans beholden to him. He has stocked the Supreme Court and federal courts at all levels. World leaders who were once critics have left the world stage or are more willing to work with him.",
      "Here are some of the ways things have changed:",
      "Trump's first-term agenda was, particularly in its early days, often stymied by the courts and infighting. Many of his Cabinet picks quietly or openly worked to stop his ideas.",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know the people. I had to rely on people to give me names,\u201d he said during a Turning Point event in 2023. But now, he said, \u201dI know the great ones. I know the smart ones. I know the dumb ones, I know the weak ones, I know the stupid ones.\u201d",
      "Trump and his allies have also had four years out of office to lay the groundwork for his return. Long before his formal transition kicked into gear, allied groups such as the Heritage Foundation and the America First Policy Institute were working to draft hundreds of policy papers, executive orders and legislation ready to push on Day 1.",
      "In 2017, the House speaker was Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had pulled his endorsement during the 2016 campaign and later called Trump an \u201c authoritarian narcissist.\" The Senate majority leader was Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who labeled Trump \u201cstupid,\" \u201cill-tempered\u201d and a \u201cdespicable human being.\"",
      "Ryan did not run for reelection in 2018. McConnell has stepped down as party leader but remains in the Senate. Vocal critics such as Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney are gone. Trump's aggressive plays in Republican primaries have created a new generation of members who listen to him. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the new Senate Majority Leader, John Thune of South Dakota, know their power depends, in large part, on Trump's backing.",

      "Banks cited the reaction when Trump addressed Senate Republicans in the Capitol while in town for former President Jimmy Carter\u2019s funeral. All the members, including past critics, he said, were on their feet, expressing their support for Trump, his agenda and his Cabinet nominees.",
      "Trump went through half a dozen campaign managers over his first two White House runs and four chiefs of staff during his first term. His White House was known for backbiting and squabbling among competing factions.",
      "Trump's 2024 operation was different. Guided by veteran Florida Republican operative Susie Wiles, the campaign was widely praised by both parties as his most disciplined, professional and competent by far.",
      "Wiles is joining Trump in Washington as his chief of staff. While there are still personality clashes, Wiles has made clear she won't tolerate those who try to hijack the operation.",
      "\"I don\u2019t welcome people who want to work solo or be a star,\u201d Wiles told the news outlet Axios in a recent interview. \u201cMy team and I will not tolerate backbiting, second-guessing inappropriately, or drama. These are counterproductive to the 'mission.\u201d",
      "German Chancellor Angela Merkel stepped down in 2021. Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau is on his way out. And there have been turbulent leadership changes in Britain, France and South Korea.",

      "As he prepares to become the nation\u2019s first millennial vice president, JD Vance is already a budding kingmaker in Republican politics and the presumptive heir to the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement",
      "NEW YORK -- As he prepares to become the nation's first millennial vice president, JD Vance is already the presumptive heir to the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement.",
      "Vance hasn't been assigned a specific portfolio in the White House like some of his predecessors. While he has long-standing areas of interest, from tech and disaster relief to immigration, people close to the former Ohio senator say he sees his role as doing whatever is needed to best help President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration accomplish his agenda. He is also expected to be a liaison to Capitol Hill, leveraging relationships he built during his two years in the Senate.",
      "\u201cI would say JD\u2019s the guy that will plug any hole or be as beneficial to the administration and be as beneficial to President Trump as possible,\u201d said Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, a friend and ally.",
      "Moreno said Vance would also continue the role he played during the campaign as Trump\u2019s chief messenger, defending him on television and jousting with reporters.",
      "\"His most important job is to be out there and be President Trump\u2019s pit bull,\u201d said Moreno. When Trump needs somebody to defend him or his policies, he added, \u201cJD\u2019s going to be the guy that leads the troops to have President Trump\u2019s back.\u201d",
      "It has been an astounding eight years for the 40-year-old \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author, who has transformed himself from a former venture capitalist and harsh Trump critic. Vance will be a critical part not just of Trump's return to the White House but the future of his political movement. With Trump prevented by the Constitution from running in 2028, Vance is a natural successor.",
      "But first, he needs to stay in Trump's good graces.",
      "Trump's decision to tap Vance as his No. 2 landed with a thud at first.",
      "Vance faced a barrage of criticism over his past remarks deriding women who weren't parents as \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d and for suggesting those without biological children should not be in positions of power. Headlines panned him as the least popular vice presidential candidate in modern history.",
      "But Vance soon delivered a widely praised performance during the vice presidential debate and established himself as a top Trump surrogate, someone who regularly answered reporters' questions and sat for interviews with outlets of all stripes. He once appeared on three Sunday shows in a single day.",
      "Vance's willingness to wade into sometimes hostile territory earned Trump's praise.",
      "\u201cHe is a feisty guy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Trump said during his victory speech the night of the election, describing how he had instructed Vance to \u201cgo into the enemy camp.\" While some Republicans might have resisted going on CNN or speaking with The New York Times, Trump said, Vance \"really looks forward to it, and then he just goes in and absolutely obliterates them.\u201d",
      "Vance, he added, \u201cturned out to be a good choice. I took a little heat at the beginning, but he was \u2014 I knew the brain was a good one, about as good as it gets.\"",
      "Things didn\u2019t go so well for Trump\u2019s last vice president.",
      "Mike Pence, who was unfailingly loyal to his boss, ended his term fleeing from a violent mob on Jan. 6, 2021, after he refused to go along with Trump\u2019s scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "Trump would not forgive Pence, blaming him for their loss, and turned legions of his supporters against his second-in-command. Pence would end his own bid for the 2024 nomination months before the first votes were cast after struggling to raise money or draw significant crowds.",
      "\u201cPence and Trump started off on this same footing, with the same high expectations, and had a great working relationship,\u201d said Devin O\u2019Malley, the vice president\u2019s former press secretary and senior adviser to his campaign. O\u2019Malley stressed that he did not expect things to end up the same way for Vance, whom he said \u201cappears to be hitting all the marks to be successful in the role.\u201d",
      "While Trump and Pence were always said to be close before their split, they had very different personalities. Trump picked Pence, someone he barely knew, in part to assuage evangelical Christians alarmed over Trump's behavior and to win over other Republicans skeptical of his outsider candidacy.",
      "Aides have long described Trump and Vance as real friends who enjoy each other\u2019s company. The two speak almost every day on the phone, in person or by text.",
      "Unlike Pence, Vance is also ideologically aligned with Trump on major issues ranging from trade to the use of U.S. forces overseas. He is close to Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and has developed strong relationships with incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles, senior adviser Stephen Miller and others.",
      "He also has ties to the new generation of tech billionaires ascendant in Trump's orbit, including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, who once employed Vance and backed his rise in politics.",
      "While 2028 is years away, Vance for now is seen by many as the natural torchbearer for the MAGA movement, even as other Republicans with national ambitions circle nearby.",
      "Senior Trump adviser Jason Miller called him \u201cthe future of the Republican Party and this movement that President Trump has started.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really see him as being the person to be the flag bearer going forward, following President Trump,\u201d he said at a recent gathering of business leaders.",
      "When he is sworn in on Monday, Vance will make history as the first millennial to serve in the role and the first vice president in nearly two decades with young children.",
      "Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., recently traveled with Vance to North Carolina to meet with victims of Hurricane Helene. She suggested his relative youth on the national stage gave Vance certain advantages including a comfort with social media and different communication style.",
      "\u201cI think because he is younger he has a boldness that \u2013 with the exception of President Trump \u2013 as you age, your boldness I think becomes shade by lessons learned over the years,\u201d Capito said.",
      "People close to Vance like to stress that he is a regular person \u2014 \u201cabout as normal a guy as there\u2019s ever been in politics,\u201d Moreno said \u2014 with a working-class background.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll wear sweatshirts. He roots for sports teams... He\u2019s a guy\u2019s guy. He\u2019s a bro\u2019s bro,\" said Terry Schilling, president of American Principles Project, who has been advising Vance informally on cultural and family issues since he started running for the Senate. \"He\u2019ll have a beer with you. He'll watch a football game with you. He'll tease you, he\u2019ll rib you. He\u2019s also going to work hard and be serious when he needs to.\u201d",
      "Indeed, after his beloved Ohio State clinched a spot in the national football championship game, Vance took to social media to bemoan his dilemma. The Buckeyes play Notre Dame for the title in Atlanta on Monday night, hours after he and Trump are set to be sworn into office.",
      "\u201cHopefully everyone is cool with me skipping the inauguration so I can go to the national title game,\u201d Vance joked on X, sharing a mock comic strip featuring two red buttons \u2014 \u201cAttend your own inauguration\u201d and \u201cGo watch the Buckeyes win a national title\u201d \u2014 and a sweating superhero torn between them.",
      "It was the kind of quip relatable to any sports fan and the latest burnishing of his regular-guy persona.",
      "But Vance is scheduled to stay in Washington \u2014 even if he'll be checking his phone at the Liberty Ball."

      "WASHINGTON -- Most presidents get to move into the White House once. President-elect Donald Trump is doing it twice, and his wife, Melania, says it's a lot easier the second time around.",
      "\u201cI know where I will be going. I know the rooms where we will be living. I know the process,\u201d the incoming first lady said recently. She described their first move to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. in 2017 as \u201cchallenging.\u201d",
      "Regardless of who is president, the whole process also challenges the White House residence staff: The maids, butlers and others who look after the president's private living space have about five hours \u2014 from start to finish \u2014 on Inauguration Day to move out one first family and settle in the next one.",
      "\u201cEverything needs to be planned to the minute,\u201d Melania Trump said on Fox News' \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d",
      "The clock starts ticking when the outgoing and incoming presidents leave the White House together for a shared limousine ride to the Capitol for the swearing-in.",
      "\u201cAs soon as they leave, the executive residence staff swings into action,\u201d Matthew Costello, chief education officer of the White House Historical Association, said during a recent online program about Inauguration Day history. \u201cEssentially, staff is working nonstop to inventory, process and move all of the personal items of one first family out and a new first family in.\u201d",
      "After the oath-taking, inaugural address, luncheon and traditional parade, the new president gets to go into the White House to find the family's clothes, furniture and other personal belongings in place and the kitchen stocked with favorite foods.",
      "It's possible that Monday's timeline could be altered after Trump announced that he's moving the inaugural ceremony indoors to the Capitol Rotunda because of approaching bitter cold weather. He's also turning what's typically an hourslong parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House into an indoor version at a pro sports arena.",
      "As the ceremony gets underway, moving trucks for each family that have been on standby nearby will get the all-clear to be waved through tight security to the White House.",
      "The residence staff works in groups. Some will be assigned to pack the Biden family's remaining items while another group loads the boxes onto the designated truck. Other staffers will bring the Trumps' things inside while another group unpacks and puts them where Melania Trump wants them.",
      "The White House is deep-cleaned in between families. Windows will be washed, carpets vacuumed or replaced, new mattresses brought in, and all bedrooms and bathrooms will be stocked with fresh linens and towels.",
      "The process typically starts after the November election when the White House chief usher gets in touch with the president-elect's team to begin coordinating the move.",
      "In November 2016, then-first lady Michelle Obama showed Melania Trump around the living quarters when she accompanied Trump for his Oval Office meeting with then-President Barack Obama.",
      "But after Trump lost reelection in 2020, he broke with tradition and refused to invite then-President-elect Joe Biden to meet. Melania Trump also didn't invite Jill Biden to the residence.",
      "This time around, Trump accepted Biden's invitation to the Oval Office while Melania Trump rejected Jill Biden's offer for them to meet."

      "President Joe Biden is spending his final full day in office in South Carolina",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Joe Biden is spending his final full day in office Sunday in South Carolina, a state that holds special meaning after his commanding win in the 2020 Democratic primary there set him up to achieve his life's goal of being elected president of the United States.",
      "On the eve of Monday's inauguration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, Biden planned to deliver a final farewell from the state that brought him to the dance, as he likes to say.",
      "Biden, accompanied by his wife, first lady Jill Biden, was scheduled to visit Royal Missionary Baptist Church in North Charleston to worship and speak on the legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the White House said. Monday is the federal holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader.",
      "Afterward, the Bidens will tour the International African American Museum. It was built on a waterfront site where tens of thousands of enslaved Africans were brought to the U.S. from the late 1760s through 1808, according to the museum's website.",
      "Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a key Biden ally, said the trip was Biden's way of saying \u201cthank you\u201d to the state.",
      "\u201cJoe Biden is showing once again who he is by coming back to the state that really launched him to the presidency,\u201d Clyburn told The Associated Press in an interview.",
      "The president delivered a televised farewell address to the nation on Wednesday.",
      "Back in 2020, Biden saw his campaign flounder after he lost the opening contests in New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada. But at the fourth stop, South Carolina \u2014 where Black voters make up a majority of the Democratic electorate \u2014 he was lifted to victory after Clyburn's endorsement.",
      "\u201cI know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us,\u201d the congressman said at the time.",
      "After winning election and taking office, Biden pushed for South Carolina to move to the head of the line and be the state that opened the Democratic Party's nominating process for 2024, instead of New Hampshire. He easily won the state's primary that year.",
      "\u201cIn 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign, and set us on the path to winning the presidency,\u201d Biden said in a statement after winning the primary for the second time. \u201cNow in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the Presidency again \u2014 and making Donald Trump a loser \u2014 again.\u201d",
      "It didn't turn out that way. After faltering in a debate against Trump, Biden dropped out of the race under pressure from many Democrats, though Clyburn notably was not among them.",
      "Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced him as the Democrats' nominee. She lost to Trump.",
      "Clyburn said Biden told him he wanted to visit the African American history museum, which Clyburn helped start. They were planning to spend some time together there.",
      "\u201cThis is his way of saying \u2018thank you,\u2019\u201d Clyburn said.",

      "Washington has prepared in unprecedented ways to keep the unfolding events save and secure. But unlike when Trump helped spark a mob of his supporters to attack the Capitol and tried to retain power in 2021 after his loss to Democrat Joe Biden, officials are not expecting massive protests, unrest and violence this time. Instead, the city is braced for crowds celebrating Trump's second term and MAGA's total control of the Republican Party.",
      "It is a remarkable turnaround after Trump left the nation\u2019s capital four years in disgrace and skipped the inauguration of his successor. Trump blasted his way through the 2024 GOP presidential primary and won November's election by an Electoral College margin unseen since Democrat Barack Obama was reelected in 2012.",
      "Yet even with that comfortable victory and his party in full, albeit narrow, control of Congress, the incoming president remains one of the most polarizing figures in U.S. history, with nearly as many fierce detractors as ardent supporters.",
      "That means it could be difficult to fulfill postelection pledges about promoting bipartisanship while healing political differences. He told NBC News on Saturday that unity would be a theme of his inauguration speech Monday at the Capitol, along with strength and fairness.",
      "\u201cJanuary 20th cannot come fast enough!,\" he posted on his social media site. \u201cEverybody, even those that initially opposed a Victory by President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Administration, just want it to happen.\u201d",
      "Keeping to tradition, Trump spent Saturday night at Blair House, the president's official guest residence on Pennsylvania Avenue, across from the White House. He arrived there after a party at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, about 30 miles west of the city, that illuminated the night sky.",
      "He had arrived in Washington from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, aboard a C-32, the military variant of the Boeing 757, painted in the iconic presidential powder blue and white color scheme. The aircraft that would be known as Air Force One if the president were aboard carried the president-elect as Special Air Mission 47.",

      "Baltimore is seeing a sustained reduction in gun violence and city leaders believe investments in robust anti-violence efforts are finally paying off",
      "BALTIMORE -- With his dad in prison and his mom suffering from alcoholism, Malik Grant faced abandonment and instability early on. He got used to people letting him down.",
      "So when outreach workers from a Baltimore anti-violence program offered to help him stay safe and leave the streets behind, he didn\u2019t necessarily have high expectations.",
      "Two years later, Grant has an apartment and a full-time job with the city\u2019s Department of Public Works. He recently started his own business that provides cleaning, landscaping and junk removal services. He plans to hire other young men from his old neighborhood to show them what is possible with hard work.",
      "\u201cI just needed a push,\u201d he said with a smile.",
      "Grant, 29, is among about 200 people receiving support through Baltimore\u2019s relatively new Group Violence Reduction Strategy, which targets the root causes of gun violence: hopelessness, joblessness, poverty, mental health, substance abuse, housing instability, poor conflict resolution and more.",
      "The program uses a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d approach. Where possible, it offers resources and social services to those most likely to become shooters or victims. But if they stay involved in crime, they face police investigation and potential prosecution, which has led to over 350 arrests since the new strategy launched in January 2022.",
      "The early results are promising.",
      "Baltimore recorded 201 homicides in 2024, the lowest annual total in over a decade, according to police data. It marks a 23% drop from the previous year, a downward trend that began in 2023. Nonfatal shootings also have fallen significantly.",
      "To some extent, the data echoes nationwide trends since many cities saw violence peak during the pandemic. Philadelphia and Detroit are among those recording a recent drop in homicides.",
      "It\u2019s a relief for Baltimore, where gun violence surged after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray exposed an urgent need for police reform. And while other factors almost certainly contributed to the decrease, including changes in policing and strong detective work, city leaders are quick to credit efforts like the Group Violence Reduction Strategy.",
      "The program assigns each participant a life coach to help navigate everything from obtaining a driver\u2019s license and opening a bank account to applying for food stamps, earning a GED, finding stable housing and holding down a job.",
      "That often means leaving behind familiar patterns and embracing the unknown, even when a brighter future seems inaccessible or unlikely, said Sterling Herring with Youth Advocate Programs, which contracts with the city to provide services.",
      "\u201cA lot of our guys won\u2019t know their social security number, but know their jail ID,\u201d Herring said. \u201cThat\u2019s the mindset that we have to change.\u201d",
      "Grant survived a shooting in 2020 that left him hospitalized in a coma. After he connected with Youth Advocate Programs, he was eligible for emergency relocation and spent several months in hotels before moving to his current apartment. It\u2019s the first place he can proudly call home, and he shares the space with his beloved husky-pit bull mix.",
      "After months of receiving rental assistance, he will soon start fully covering the rent on his own.",
      "And Grant\u2019s company recently signed its first contract. He joked that being diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder makes him uniquely suited to run a cleaning business.",
      "\u201cHe turned his childhood trauma into treasure,\u201d life coach Sacha Smith said.",
      "Experts say so-called \u201cfocused deterrence\u201d programs are among the best ways to reduce gun violence, but Baltimore has tried and failed to implement similar strategies in the past.",
      "For them to succeed, participants need a life-changing level of support, which requires dedicated and effective staff with access to sufficient resources. The law enforcement side of the equation requires building strong cases that lead to successful prosecutions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to get right,\u201d said Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore. \u201cWhat you really want that program to do is change an entire system of how law enforcement works to combat gun violence.\u201d",
      "While praising the city\u2019s recent efforts, Webster also pointed to federal and state legislation to tighten gun laws and a more aggressive approach to prosecuting illegal firearm cases in Baltimore.",
      "Meanwhile, the Baltimore Police Department is undergoing significant court-ordered changes aimed at curbing unconstitutional practices. The agency was placed under a federal consent decree after the Justice Department launched an investigation in the wake of Gray\u2019s death from spinal injuries sustained during police transport.",
      "Homicides spiked around that time and remained elevated for years.",
      "Police Commissioner Richard Worley said the city is now proving it\u2019s possible to simultaneously reduce violent crime and reform law enforcement. He attributed the success to strong partnerships between city agencies, community groups and law enforcement.",
      "The new anti-violence strategy now operates in four of nine police districts, with plans to expand citywide. Researchers found it was responsible for reducing shootings and homicides by roughly a quarter in the 18 months after it was implemented in the city\u2019s notoriously violent Western District.",
      "Worley said increased community trust and lower caseloads are also helping detectives solve more homicides. Officers are going after the relatively small number of known shooters, rather than conducting large-scale arrests.",
      "Mayor Brandon Scott, who won reelection last year, released a five-year plan in 2021 that he hoped would reduce Baltimore gun violence by 15% annually. He created a new office to oversee anti-violence efforts, including the city\u2019s flagship Safe Streets program, which employs conflict mediators with credibility and knowledge of the streets.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about really a herculean effort,\u201d Scott said in a recent interview.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore visited Baltimore earlier this month for a news conference about the homicide numbers, praising what he called \u201can \u2018all of the above\u2019 approach.\u201d",
      "But officials also acknowledged the still-staggering loss of life.",
      "Kierra Morrison, whose 17-year-old son was shot and killed on Christmas Eve, attended a candlelight vigil this month in downtown Baltimore to mourn last year\u2019s 201 victims. The city\u2019s recent accomplishments brought her little comfort.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lost for words,\u201d she said.",
      "Morrison said her son had recently been talking about enrolling in a job training program. It made her hopeful he would find a bright future despite recent challenges. If only he\u2019d had more time."

      "The booming solar industry has found an unlikely mascot in sheep as large-scale solar farms crop up across the U.S. and in the plain fields of Texas. In Milam County, outside Austin, SB Energy operates the fifth-largest solar project in the country, capable of generating 900 megawatts of power across 4,000 acres (1,618 hectares).",

      "\u201cThe industry tends to rely on gas-powered mowers, which kind of contradicts the purpose of renewables,\u201d SB Energy asset manager James Hawkins said.",
      "Putting the animals to work on solar fields also provides some help to the sheep and wool market, which has struggled in recent years. The inventory of sheep and lamb in Texas fell to 655,000 in January 2024, a 4% drop from the previous year, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Because solar fields use sunny, flat land that is often ideal for livestock grazing, the power plants have been used in coordination with farmers rather than against them.",
      "Sheepherder JR Howard accidentally found himself in the middle of Texas\u2019 burgeoning clean energy transition. In 2021, he and his family began contracting with solar farms \u2014 sites with hundreds of thousands of solar modules \u2014 to use his sheep to eat the grass.",
      "What was once a small business has turned into a full-scale operation with more than 8,000 sheep and 26 employees.",
      "\u201cJust the growth has been kind of crazy for us,\u201d said Howard, who named his company Texas Solar Sheep. \u201cIt\u2019s been great for me and my family.\u201d",
      "Some agriculture experts say Howard's success reflects how solar farms have become a boon for some ranchers.",
      "Reid Redden, a sheep farmer and solar vegetation manager in San Angelo, Texas, said a successful sheep business requires agricultural land that has become increasingly scarce.",
      "\u201cSolar grazing is probably the biggest opportunity that the sheep industry had in the United States in several generations,\u201d Redden said.",
      "The response to solar grazing has been overwhelmingly positive in rural communities near South Texas solar farms where Redden raises sheep for sites to use, he said.",
      "\u201cI think it softens the blow of the big shock and awe of a big solar farm coming in,\u201d Redden said.",
      "Agrivoltaics itself isn't new. Solar farms are land-intensive and require a lot of space that could be used for food production. Agrivoltaics compensates by allowing the two to coexist, whether growing food or caring for livestock.",
      "There is a lot still unknown about the full effects of solar grazing, said Nuria Gomez-Casanovas, an assistant professor in regenerative system ecology at Texas A&M University.",
      "Not enough studies have been done to know the long-term environmental impacts, such as how viable the soil will be for future agriculture, although Gomez-Casanovas suspects solar grazing may improve sheep productivity because the panels provide shade and can be more cost-efficient than mowing.",
      "\u201cWe really have more questions than answers,\u201d Gomez-Casanovas said. \u201cThere are studies that show that the land productivity is not higher versus solar alone or agriculture alone, so it's context-dependent.\u201d",
      "As one of Texas' largest solar sheep operators, Howard has more clients than he can handle. He expects to add about 20 more employees by the end of this year, which would nearly double his current workforce. As for the sheep, he has enough already.",

    "published": "Mon, 20 Jan 2025 05:55:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Lord Rose says it harms productivity but expert says hybrid work can be as good as full-time in the office.",
    "story": [
      "Working from home is creating a generation who are \"not doing proper work\", the former boss of Marks and Spencer and Asda has warned.",
      "Lord Rose told BBC Panorama that home working was part of the UK economy's \"general decline\" and employees' productivity was suffering.",
      "His comments come as some companies are calling time on remote working. Amazon, Boots and JP Morgan are just some of the businesses who now require their head office staff to be in every day.",
      "However, work-from-home expert Prof Nicholas Bloom said that while fully remote work can be \"quite damaging\" to some workers' productivity, spending three days out of five in the office was as productive as fully office-based work overall.",
      "Lord Rose, who was chief executive of M&S and recently stepped down as the chairman of Asda, said: \"We have regressed in this country in terms of working practices, productivity and in terms of the country's wellbeing, I think, by 20 years in the last four.\"",
      "In a November 2024 GB snapshot survey by the Office for National Statistics, 26% of people said they had been hybrid-working in the prior seven days, with some days in the workplace and some days at home - while 14% had been fully remote and 41% had commuted to their workplace every day (the remainder were not working in the week surveyed).",
      "The shift to working from home has transformed local economies. Industry estimates indicate that vacant office space has nearly doubled since the pandemic, a quarter of dry-cleaning businesses have shut down, and the number of golf games played during the working week has risen 350% - suggesting some people are mixing work and pleasure.",
      "Working from home is rapidly becoming a major battleground in the culture wars. The government is currently legislating to strengthen the right of employees across the UK to request working from home and says that it intends to make it harder for employers to turn down requests.",
      "But some employers - including government bodies - are battling with staff to get them back into the office, arguing that face-to-face interaction is essential to collaborative working.",
      "In some cases, such as independent record label Hospital Records, this requires negotiation between a young workforce - some of whom may never have worked full-time in an office - and their older bosses.",
      "Company founder Chris Goss, who introduced a new policy requiring staff work three days in the office rather than two, said he had \"a nagging feeling\" that remote working has affected the company's bottom line.",
      "\"I firmly believe that the music industry is all about relationships, and so the one single way for any of us to be able to build those kind of meaningful relationships is to do it in person.\"",
      "Maya, a 25-year-old marketing manager at the company, said she likes being around her more experienced colleagues in the workplace. \"There's a lot of people in my team that are a lot further along in their career, so if I need help with something, you know, I can just ask someone.\"",
      "But she believes she would not be able to be in the office five days a week \"because my social battery drains and I need sometimes to be just at home and just to smash out loads of admin\".",
      "Prof Bloom, a Stanford University economist, said his research into working from home suggests employees in their teens and early 20s should probably be in the office at least four days a week to maximise their opportunities for being mentored.",
      "However, he said polls of tens of thousands of employees in the UK, US and Europe suggest workers valued the ability to work from home for two days a week about as much as an 8% pay rise.",
      "Employment rights minister Justin Madders told Panorama there was a growing body of evidence that working from home was more productive. He also said it was good for growth because companies will have \"a much more motivated workforce\" and \"if we're able to get more people into work because flexibility is available for them, that will help us reach our growth ambitions\".",
      "Prof Bloom may not be as optimistic about the effect hybrid working has on productivity, but he does agree that increasing the number of roles which can be done from home could help with economic growth if it encourages more people back into work, such as those with caring responsibilities.",
      "\"That is a huge boost\" and \"kind of a win, win, win\", because people would be able to work in better conditions, contribute to tax revenue and \"everyone gains\".",
      "One of the people who could benefit is Harleen, who was made redundant after she had her second child and has been unable to return to work because she cannot find a fully remote role that fits around her autistic son's routine.",
      "\"I am not seeing those jobs advertised. I'm not seeing anything that caters to that flexibility,\" she said.",
      "\"Every day I wake up and I'm thinking I'm living in Groundhog Day. All I'm doing is being a mother. I enjoy being a mum, but I want productivity. I start to feel like I'm just being brain dead.\"",
      "In the public sector, productivity is the lowest it has been since 1997 - except for the pandemic lockdown years - and some blame working from home. Since November 2023, civil servants have been called back in for between two to three days a week.",
      "But in several public bodies, including at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in Newport, South Wales, some staff are refusing to return.",
      "Ed, an IT delivery manager at the ONS and a rep for the PCS trade union, said he has worked almost entirely from home since the pandemic. He says it helps him to get his children to school and nursery and not waste time on commuting.",
      "\"We've never been told by senior leaders at the ONS that there is a problem with productivity, there's a problem with quality, there's a problem with meeting deadlines,\" he said.",
      "\"We will never see this opportunity again. We have to fight for workers' rights.\"",
      "He and other union members are threatening to strike if they are forced to travel into the office 40% of the time. Civilian staff in the Metropolitan Police and union members at the Land Registry are also in dispute over policies on returning to the office.",
      "The ONS, which is in talks with the union, says it believes \"face-to-face interaction\" helps to \"build working relationships, supports collaboration, and innovation\".",
      "But whatever the outcome of disputes such as this, it is clear that all of us working full-time in the office is now a thing of the past."

      "\"Remain in Mexico\"",
      "His White House will also re-implement his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy in a day-one executive order, he said. A measure from his first term, it returned about 70,000 non-Mexican asylum seekers across the border to Mexico to await hearings.",
      "Terrorism designation for gangs and cartels",
      "The president will officially designate cartels and international gangs as foreign terrorist organisations, according to his inaugural address. Central American MS-13 and Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua will be added to a list that includes Al Qaeda, the so-called Islamic State and Hamas.",
      "Resume wall-building",
      "When Trump was first elected president in 2016, he signed an executive order to build a border wall. Although parts of the wall have been built, there is still much left uncompleted, and an official told reporters before the inauguration that Trump would issue a directive to finish what he started.",
      "End birthright citizenship",
      "Trump has called the constitutional right that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen \"ridiculous\". Trump officials also told reporters that the president would deny birthright citizenship to the children of immigrants who are in the US illegally.",

      "These pledges could face legal and logistical challenges.",
      "Closing the border on health grounds",
      "A 1944 measure called Title 42 allows the US government to curb migration to protect public health. It was last used during the pandemic, but US media report that the new administration is looking for a disease that would help justify its plans to close the southern US border with Mexico.",

      "Under a strange pink-purple glow, illuminated panels buzz and cylindrical columns of water bubble away, as a futuristic crop of microalgae grows.",
      "It's here that Iceland's Vaxa Technologies has developed a system that harnesses energy and other resources from the nearby power plant, to cultivate these tiny aquatic organisms.",
      "\u201cIt's a new way of thinking about food production,\u201d says general manager, Kristinn Haflidason as he gives me a tour of the space-age facility.",
      "For much of our history, humans have consumed seaweed, also know as macroalgae.",
      "But its tiny relative, microalgae has been a less common food source, although it was eaten for centuries in ancient Central America and Africa.",
      "Now scientists and entrepreneurs are increasingly exploring its potential as a nutrition-rich, sustainable food.",
      "About 35 minutes from the capital Reykjavik, the Vaxa site produces the microalgae Nannochloropsis, both as food for people, and for feed in fish and shrimp farming.",
      "It also grows a type of bacteria called Arthospira, also known as blue-green algae, as it shares similar properties with microalgae.",
      "When dried out it's know as spirulina and is used as a dietary supplements, a food ingredients, and as a bright-blue food colouring.",
      "These tiny organisms photosynthesise, capturing energy from light to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.",
      "\u201cThe algae is eating CO2, or turning the CO2 into biomass,\u201d explains Mr Haflidason. \u201cIt's carbon negative.\u201d",
      "Vaxa's plant has a unique situation.",
      "It's the only place where algae cultivation is integrated with a geothermal power station, which supplies clean electricity, delivers cold water for cultivation, hot water for heating, and even pipes across its CO2 emissions.",
      "\u201cYou end up with a slightly negative carbon footprint,\u201d says Asger Munch Smidt-Jensen, a food technology consultant at Danish Technology Institute (DTI), who co-authored a study assessing the environmental impact of Vaxa\u2019s spirulina production.",
      "\u201cWe also found a relatively low footprint, both in terms of land and water use.\u201d",
      "Round-the-clock renewable energy, plus a stream of CO2, and nutrients with a low carbon footprint, are needed to ensure the setup is climate-friendly, and he thinks that isn\u2019t easily replicated.",
      "\u201cThere is a huge input of energy to run these photo-bioreactors, and you have to artificially simulate the sun, so you need a high energy light source,\u201d he explains.",
      "\"My main takeaway is that we should utilise these areas [like Iceland] where we have low impact energy sources to make energy intensive products,\u201d adds Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen.",
      "Back at the algae plant, I climb onto an elevated platform, where I\u2019m surrounded by noisy modular units called photo-bioreactors, where thousands upon thousands of tiny red and blue LED lights fuel the microalgae\u2019s growth, in place of sunlight.",
      "They\u2019re also supplied water and nutrients.",
      "\u201cMore than 90% of the photosynthesis happens within very specific wavelengths of red and blue light,\u201d explains Mr Haflidason. \u201cWe are only giving them the light that they use.\u201d",
      "All the conditions are tightly controlled and optimised by machine learning, he adds.",
      "About 7% of the crop is harvested daily, and rapidly replenished by new growth.",
      "Vaxa\u2019s facility can produce up to 150 metric tonnes of algae annually, and it plans to expand.",
      "As the crops are rich in protein, carbohydrate, omega-3s, fatty-acids, and vitamin B12, Mr Haflidason believes growing microalgae this way, could help tackle global food insecurity.",
      "Many other companies are betting on the potential of microalgae - it's estimated the market will be worth $25.4bn (\u00a320.5bn) by 2033.",
      "Danish start-up Algiecel has been trialling portable shipping container-sized modules that house photo-bioreactors, and which could link up to carbon-emitting industries to capture their CO2, while simultaneously producing food and feed.",
      "Crops are also being used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, biofuel and a replacement for plastic.",
      "Perhaps also microalgae could be produced in space.",
      "In a project funded by the European Space Agency, the Danish Technological Institution plans to test if a microalgae can be grown on the International Space Station.",
      "Despite all the investment, there\u2019s some way to go before micro-algae become an everyday part of our diet.",
      "It still needs a lot of development, according to Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen.",
      "He points out that the texture lacks firmness. Meanwhile the taste can be \"fishy\" if the algae is a saltwater variety.",
      "\u201cBut there are ways of coming overcoming this,\u201d he adds.",
      "There\u2019s also the societal question.",
      "\u201cAre people ready for it? How do we make it so that everyone wants to eat this?\"",
      "Malene Lihme Olsen, a food scientist at Copenhagen University who researches micro algae, says its nutritional value needs more research.",
      "\"Green microalgae [chlorella] have a very robust cell wall, so it can be difficult for us to digest and get all the nutrients,\u201d she says.",
      "For now she says microalgae is better added to other \u201ccarrier products\u201d like pasta or bread to help with taste, texture and appearance.",
      "However, Ms Olsen believes microalgae are a promising future food.",
      "\u201cIf you compare one hectare of soy in Brazil, and imagine we had one hectare of algae field, you could produce 15 times more protein a year [from the algae].\u201d",
      "Back at the plant I'm looking at an unappetising green sludge. It's the harvested microalgae with the water squeezed out, ready for further processing.",
      "Mr Haflidason offers me a taste and, after initial reluctance, I try some and find its flavour neutral with a texture like tofu.",
      "\u201cWe are absolutely not proposing that anyone should eat green sludge,\u201d jokes Mr Haflidason.",
      "Instead the processed algae is an ingredient for everyday foods, and in Reykjavik one bakery makes bread with Spirulina and a gym puts it in smoothies.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to change what you eat. We're just going to change the nutritional value of the foods that you eat,\u201d he says.",

      "The UK has effectively stopped its own vessels from fishing the species since 2021 through its licensing regime, on the grounds it is required to prevent overfishing and protect the North Sea ecosystem.",
      "Rishi Sunak's Conservative government then banned all vessels from catching the species in English waters of the sea in March last year, with a similar ban in Scottish waters brought in by ministers in the SNP-led Scottish government.",
      "It won the UK plaudits from conservation groups, which had long campaigned for an outright ban, and Sir Keir's Labour government has kept the ban in place since taking power in July.",
      "But it has outraged Danish fishermen, who sell sandeel to animal feed and fish oil producers and under the post-Brexit trade deal hold the right to fish the overwhelming majority of the EU's share of the species in UK waters.",
      "Small fish, big row",
      "The dispute centres on whether the UK's right to restrict trawlers for conservation reasons unnecessarily restricts agreed EU fishing rights.",
      "In its submissions to the court, the EU has argued the geographical scope of the ban is not justified by the scientific modelling on stock levels, or the \"economic and social impacts\" on Danish fishing communities.",
      "In a response published by the court, the UK has defended the scientific advice behind the ban, adding that the EU has failed to point out \"any superior model\" available at the time.",
      "It added that the UK was within its rights to bring in the ban, highlighting that the trade agreement itself commits both sides to taking account of the impact of fishing on marine diversity.",
      "The UK decision to continue the ban has been backed by an unlikely coalition stretching across three political parties, conservation groups and committed Brexiteers.",
      "The renewable energy industry has also taken an interest, arguing the ban helps achieve the necessary level of seabird \"resilience\" to allow more wind farms to be built whilst still hitting conservation targets.",
      "The UK has previously estimated sandeel caught in its waters is worth around \u00a345m a year, a tiny industry in the context of the wider trade relationship.",

      "But Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that \"for consumers who want to post videos of their cats dancing, that doesn't seem like a security threat to me\".",
      "The West - and the rest",
      "Another aspect to consider about TikTok's future post-US ban is whether or not the app can continue to thrive without a US customer base.",
      "Any app that loses 170m users would suffer but US users in particular are valuable for creators, advertisers and direct spending in TikTok Shop.",
      "If the rest of the West follows it will reduce the money flowing into the company and curtail development of new features, further entrenching the dominance of US platforms like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and Snapchat.",
      "TikTok is already banned in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India too - a massive market. It has no presence in China because of its sister app Douyin.",
      "Kaspersky and Huawei both managed to weather their storms by relying on home-grown customer bases and by pivoting to regions like Africa and the Middle East.",
      "So it might be possible for TikTok to build its user bases here. But if the US ban creeps around the world then the app will likely never be as big as it currently is and may well wither and die a slow death."

    "story": [
      "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its growth forecast for the UK economy this year, but has also warned about the possible impact of Donald Trump's economic plans.",
      "The global institution upgraded its prediction for UK growth to 1.6% for this year from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "But it said a threatened wave of tariffs by incoming US president Trump could make trade tensions worse, lower investment, and disrupt supply chains across the world.",
      "The IMF also said although tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation could boost the US economy in the short term, they could ultimately backfire.",
      "The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because they will make it more expensive for companies to sell their goods in the world's biggest economy.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue - and has threatened to issue tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico on day one of his presidency next week.",
      "He has also said he would impose 100% tariffs on the BRICS bloc of nine nations if they were to create a rival currency to the US dollar.",
      "The IMF said such policies could set the scene for an inflationary boom followed by a bust and could weaken US Treasury bonds as a safe bet.",
      "As well as upgrading its outlook for the UK, the IMF suggested the UK economy would perform better than European economies such as Germany, France and Italy over the next two years.",
      "The improved forecast could be a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has faced pressure over her policy decisions this week, after figures showed the economy had flatlined.",
      "Labour has made growth its key objective, but Reeves has admitted the government has to \"do more to grow our economy\", in order to boost living standards.",
      "The latest IMF figures suggested the UK economy had weaker growth last year than the organisation had expected.",

      "Forecasts are never perfect given the many factors that affect economic growth - from geopolitics to the weather. But such reports can point in the right direction, especially where they align with other predictions.",
      "Global growth forecast to flatline as tariffs add to strains",
      "Three reasons Trump tariffs aren't China's only problem",
      "The IMF predicted \"stable, albeit lacklustre\" global growth of 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026, below a historical average of 3.7%.",
      "Its 2025 forecast was largely unchanged from a previous one, mainly because it expects higher US growth than previously predicted to offset lower growth in other major economies.",
      "The imminent arrival of Trump in the White House dominates the section on risks in the IMF's twice-yearly forecast for the world economy.",
      "When he was last in power, Trump launched into a trade war with China, and US policy led to tit-for-tat tariffs with the EU.",

      "It warns that an inflationary US boom could be followed by a possible bust that would potentially \"weaken the role of US Treasuries as the global safe asset\".",
      "Investors see US Treasury securities as one of the safest possible bets, because the bonds - which are kind of like an IOU -  are backed by the US government.",
      "In addition, if red tape on business is cut too much, this could lead to a runaway dollar that could suck money out of emerging economies, depressing global growth.",
      "Trump going ahead with deportations of illegal immigrants could \"permanently reduce potential output\" and also raise inflation, The IMF said.",

      "Strict rules on mortgage lending could be loosened to allow more people to borrow for a home, as regulators respond to a call to boost the economy.",

      "It is likely to review the balance between protecting borrowers and access to home loans, in a move that would be welcomed by lenders.",
      "The FCA will also consider whether to scrap the \u00a3100 cap on purchases made by contactless cards, in line with digital wallets where providers set their own limits.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the chancellor and business secretary wrote to the UK's main regulators in December asking them to come up with ideas for reform that could boost economic growth.",
      "They gave a deadline of mid-January. In its response, published on Friday, the FCA outlined various programmes underway as part of its aim to boost growth.",
      "But two new ideas are among others mooted, looking at mortgages and contactless payments.",
      "Strict rules mean lenders have to be sure that people can repay mortgages, testing them for higher rates of interest.",
      "Other rules were also imposed on mortgage providers after the financial crisis almost 20 years ago exposed reckless lending and put major financial institutions at risk.",
      "The FCA points to current low numbers of borrowers missing repayments, or having homes repossessed, as evidence of questioning whether the rules are too strict.",
      "\"We will begin simplifying responsible lending and advice rules for mortgages, supporting home ownership and opening a discussion on the balance between access to lending and levels of defaults,\" the letter by FCA chief executive, Nikhil Rathi said.",
      "It will consider the balance between its primary objective of protecting consumers, and a secondary objective of promoting growth.",
      "If you can't see the calculator, click here.",
      "Same mistakes?",
      "Lenders have welcomed the move, but some analysts and borrowers may question whether lessons have been learnt from the crisis.",
      "Charles Roe, director of mortgages at UK Finance, which represents lenders, said: \"Reviewing the mortgage lending rules would help with affordability issues, not just for first time buyers but also those looking to move further up the housing ladder.",
      "\"Banks will always lend responsibly but the current rules are restricting the number of people who can get a mortgage and so could be relaxed.\"",
      "Analysts said the move could prove to be more beneficial in certain parts of the country.",
      "\"The big question is whether current rules go too far but there is a risk for consumers and the government in how far this might go,\" said Richard Donnell, executive director of research at Zoopla.",
      "\"Finding the balance not easy and is compounded by the huge north-south divide in affordability.\"",
      "Contactless limits",
      "The FCA's second new idea is to scrap the \u00a3100 limit on contactless cards, to make it easier to spend.",
      "When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at \u00a310. Cards were generally used in this way in place of small change when buying snacks, papers and occasional groceries.",
      "The limit was raised gradually, to \u00a320 in 2012, then to \u00a330 in 2015, before going up to \u00a3100 in October 2021.",
      "Both ideas would be designed to encourage spending but could also be inflationary.  They would need to go through reviews and consultation, so are unlikely to be imminent changes, even if approved.",
      "The letter also outlines potential digital advances, such as requiring firms to accept electronic verification of death to speed up bereavement claims in insurance."

    "summary": "AI can take a second look at medical scans and flag up potential problems that doctors might not see.",
    "story": [
      "This is the sixth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "When 58-year-old Will Studholme ended up in accident and emergency at an NHS hospital in Oxford in 2023 with gastrointestinal symptoms, he wasn't expecting a diagnosis of osteoporosis.",
      "The disease, strongly associated with age, causes bones to become weak and fragile, increasing the risk of fracture.",
      "It turned out that Mr Studholme had a severe case of food poisoning, but early in his ailment's investigation, he received an abdominal CT scan.",
      "That scan was then later run through artificial intelligence (AI) technology which identified a collapsed vertebra in Mr Studholme's spine, a common early indicator of osteoporosis.",
      "Further testing ensued, and Mr Studholme emerged not only with his diagnosis, but a simple treatment: an annual infusion of an osteoporosis drug that is expected to improve his bone density.",
      "\"I feel very lucky,\" says Mr Studholme, \"I don't think this would have been picked up without the AI technology.\"",
      "It isn't unheard of that a radiologist might note something incidental in a patient's imaging \u2013 an undetected tumour, a concern with a particular tissue or organ \u2013 outside of what they had originally been checking for.",
      "But applying AI in the background to systematically comb through scans and automatically identify early signs of common preventable chronic diseases that might be brewing \u2013 regardless of the reason the scan was originally ordered \u2013 is new.",
      "The clinical use of AI for opportunistic screening or opportunistic imaging, as it is called, \"is just beginning\" notes Perry Pickhardt, a professor of radiology and medical physics at the University of Winconsin-Madison, who is among those developing the algorithms.",
      "It is considered opportunistic because it takes advantage of imaging that has already been done for another clinical purpose \u2013 be it suspected cancer, chest infection, appendicitis or belly pain.",
      "It has the potential to catch previously undiagnosed diseases in the early stages, before onset of symptoms, when they are easier to treat or prevent from progressing. \"We can avoid a lot of the lack of prevention that we have missed out on previously,\" says Prof Pickhardt.",
      "Regular physicals or blood tests often fail to pick up these diseases, he adds.",
      "There's a lot of data in CT scans related to body tissues and organs that we don't really use, notes Miriam Bredella, a radiologist at NYU Langone who is also developing algorithms in the field.",
      "And while analysis of it could theoretically be done without AI by radiologists making measurements \u2013 it would be time consuming.",
      "There are also benefits of the technology in terms of reducing bias, she notes.",
      "A disease like osteoporosis, for example, is thought of as mostly affecting thin, elderly white women \u2013 so doctors don't always think to look outside of that population.",
      "Opportunistic imaging, on the other hand, doesn't discriminate that way.",
      "Mr Studholme's case is a good example. Being relatively young for osteoporosis, male and with no history of broken bones, it is unlikely he would have been diagnosed without AI.",
      "In addition to osteoporosis, AI is being trained to help opportunistically identify heart disease, fatty liver disease, age-related muscle loss and diabetes.",
      "While the main focus is on CT scans, for example of the abdomen or chest, work is taking place to opportunistically glean information from other types of imaging too, including chest x-rays and mammograms.",
      "The algorithms are trained on many thousands of tagged previous scans, and it is important the training data includes scans from a wide swathe of ethnic groups if the technology is going to be deployed on a diverse range of people, stress the experts.",
      "And there is supposed to be a level of human review \u2013 if the AI finds something suspect it would be sent to radiologists to confirm before it is then reported on to doctors.",
      "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Why 'digital twins' could speed up drug discovery",
      "The AI technology used to examine Mr Studholme's scan belongs to Israeli company Nanox.AI, which is one of only a handful of companies working on AI for opportunistic screening - far more are focused on using AI to assist in the accurate and swift diagnoses of the specific conditions the scans are actually conducted for.",
      "Nanox.AI offers three opportunistic screening products aimed at helping identify osteoporosis, heart disease and fatty liver disease respectively from routine CT scans.",
      "Oxford NHS hospitals began trialling Nanox.AI's osteoporosis focused product in 2018 before officially rolling it out in 2020.",
      "Results from Oxford hospitals show an up to six-fold increase above the NHS average in the number of patients being identified with vertebral fractures \u2013 patients that can then be checked for osteoporosis, and start treatment to combat the disease, says Kassim Javaid, a professor of osteoporosis and rare bone diseases at the University of Oxford who has spearheaded the algorithm's introduction.",
      "Further trials of the algorithm are also now underway at hospitals in Cambridge, Cardiff, Nottingham and Southampton. \"We want to build the evidence to use it across the NHS,\" says Prof Javaid.",
      "Yet while the technology can benefit individuals, there are wider ramifications that need to be considered says Sebastien Ourselin, a professor of healthcare engineering at Kings College London, who heads the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare.",
      "A big problem that needs to be balanced, he notes, is the extra patient numbers that the use of the technology can create. \"This is increasing the demand on the healthcare system not reducing it,\" he says.",
      "First, people who are flagged by the opportunistic screening as potentially having a disease will likely need further confirmatory testing, which takes resources. And, if the AI is inaccurate or too sensitive, that could result in a lot of unnecessary testing.",
      "Then services need to be in place for those extra people that do end up being diagnosed.",
      "The extra load is a challenge that comes with the technology admits Prof Javaid \u2013 but there are solutions.",
      "Patients confirmed to have the fractures in Oxford are routed for follow up to a largely nurse delivered fracture prevention service so as not to overload doctors. \"The AI does force you to change your pathway,\" he says.",
      "And in the long run, believes Prof Javaid, to have a greater number of people with early-stage osteoporosis identified and receiving the preventative treatment they need will save the NHS money. \"Fracture is one of the top reasons people end up in hospital,\" he says.",
      "Mr Studholme has seen the devastation of osteoporosis first hand: it led to his mother breaking both her hips. It used to just be considered an old person's condition with nothing that could be done, he says. \"I feel quite privileged I can do something before my bones turn into chalk,\" he says."

      "Sandra is one of around 5,000 Guatemalans who go and work \u2013 legally - in the US every year, thanks to a US government visa scheme for temporary agriculture workers from overseas, called H-2A.",
      "This allows US farms that cannot find enough locals to do the work to bring in staff from overseas. The foreign workers can stay for up to 12 months, before they then have to go back to their home countries.",
      "For people like Sandra it's a chance to get on in life, and to help her family by sending back some of the money she earns. In Guatemala there are now around 30 recruitment companies that are registered with the Guatemalan government to help people find temporary work in the US via H-2A visas.",

      "In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave.",
      "Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.",
      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",
      "He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.",
      "Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".",
      "Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"",
      "Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance.",
      "\"If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,\" he says. \"But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.\"",
      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",
      "By contrast, she says the US \"has long emphasised individual achievement and ambition, which has driven tremendous innovation, but often at the cost of work-life balance\".",
      "Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations.",
      "\"Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,\" she says. \"These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being.",
      "\"More companies are recognising that well-rested and balanced employees bring fresh ideas, better problem-solving skills, and greater engagement.  Employees are beginning to feel empowered to take the time they need without sacrificing career growth.\"",

      "As fans will know by now, Roan was born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz and raised in the Bible Belt town of Willard, Missouri.",
      "The oldest of four children, she aspired to be an actress \u2013 but, for a long time, it seemed her future would be in sport. She ran at state-competition level, and almost went to college for cross-country.",
      "Then she entered a singing contest at the age of 13 and won. Before long, she'd written her first song, about a crush on a Mormon boy who wasn't allowed to date outside his faith.",
      "She took her stage name as a tribute to her grandfather Dennis K Chappell and his favourite song, a Western ballad called The Strawberry Roan.",
      "\"He was very funny and very smart,\" she recalls. \"And I don't think he ever questioned my ability.",
      "\"A lot of people were like, 'You should go completely country', or, 'You should try Christian music'. And he never told me to do anything.",
      "\"He was the only person that was like, 'You don't need a plan B. Just do it'.\"",
      "Drag queen heaven",
      "Eventually, one of her compositions, a gothic ballad called Die Young, caught the attention of Atlantic Records, which signed her at the age of just 17.",
      "Moving to LA, she recorded and released her first EP, School Nights, in 2017. It was a solid but unremarkable affair, steeped in the sounds of Lana Del Rey and Lorde.",
      "Roan only found a sound of her own when a group of gay friends took her to a drag bar.",
      "\"I walked into that club in West Hollywood and it was like heaven,\" she told the BBC last year. \"It was amazing to see all these people who were happy and confident in their bodies.",
      "\"And the go-go dancers! I was enthralled. I couldn't stop watching them. I was like, 'I have to do that'.\"",
      "She didn't become a dancer, but she did write a song imagining what it would be like to be one and how her mother would react. Roan called it Pink Pony Club after a strip bar in her home town.",
      "\"That song changed everything,\" she says. \"It put me in a new category.",
      "\"I never thought I could actually be a 'pop star girl' and Pink Pony forced me into that.\"",
      "Her label disagreed. They refused to release Pink Pony Club for two years. Shortly after they relented, Roan was dropped in a round of pandemic-era cost-cutting.",
      "Bruised but not broken, she went back home and spent the next year serving coffee in a drive-through doughnut shop.",
      "\"It absolutely had a positive impact on me,\" she says. \"You have the knowledge of what it's like to clean a public restroom. That's very important.\"",
      "The period was transformational in other ways. She saved her earnings, had her heart broken by a person \"with pale blue eyes\", moved back to Los Angeles, and gave herself a year to make it.",
      "It might have taken a little longer than that, but she hit the ground running.",
      "During her exile, Roan had stayed in touch with her Pink Pony Club co-writer, Daniel Nigro.",
      "He was also working with another up-and-coming singer called Olivia Rodrigo and, when her career took off, Roan got a courtside seat, supporting Rodrigo on tour and providing backing vocals on her second album, Guts.",
      "More importantly, Nigro used the momentum to sign Roan to his own record label and ensure the release of her debut album in September 2023.",
      "At first, it seemed like Roan's original label had been right. Sales were disappointing and audiences were slow to catch on because her in-your-face queer anthems were out of step with the trend for whispery, confessional pop.",
      "But those songs came to life on stage. Big, fun and designed for audience participation, they're taken to new heights by Roan's powerhouse voice and flamboyant stage persona.",
      "\"A drag queen does not get on stage to calm people down,\" she says. \"A drag queen does not say things to flatter people. A queen makes you blush, you know what I mean? Expect the same energy at my show.\"",
      "Sure enough, it was a live-streamed appearance at last year's Coachella Festival that pushed her into the upper echelons of pop.",
      "Dressed in a PVC crop top that declared \"Eat Me\", she played the packed Gobi tent like a headliner, strutting purposefully across the stage and coaching the audience in the campy choreography for Hot To Go.",
      "Then she stared directly into the camera and dedicated a song to her ex.",
      "\"Bitch I know you're watching\u2026 and all those horrible things happening to you are karma.\"",
      "The clip went viral and, before long, her career did, too.",
      "By the summer, all of her shows had been upgraded. Festivals kept having to move her to bigger stages. When she played Lollapalooza in August, she drew the event's biggest ever daytime crowd.",
      "\"It just takes a decade,\" she says. \"That's what I tell everyone. 'If you're OK with it taking 10 years, then you're good'.\"",
      "As fans discovered her debut album, Roan also released a standalone single - a sarcastic slice of synth-pop called Good Luck Babe, which became her breakout hit.",
      "\"I don't even know if I've ever said this in an interview, but it was originally called Good Luck, Jane,\" she reveals.",
      "\"I wanted it to be about me falling in love with my best friend, and then her being like, 'Ha ha ha, I don't like you back, I like boys.'",
      "\"And it was like, 'OK, well, good luck with that, Jane'.\"",
      "A masterclass in pop storytelling, Good Luck Babe has a proper three-act structure, with a killer pay-off in the middle eight and a chorus you just can't shake.",
      "Still, Roan was shocked by its success.",
      "\"I just threw it out, like, I don't know what this is going to do \u2013 and it carried the whole year!\"",
      "The question, of course, is what the star does next, now that she's the Sound of 2025.",
      "She's already previewed two new songs, The Subway and The Giver, in concert \u2013 but all she will reveal about a second album is that she's \"more reluctant to be sad or dark\".",
      "\"It feels so good to party,\" she explains.",
      "Looking back at the last 12 months, she's philosophical about what it means to be pop's hottest new commodity.",
      "\"A lot of people think fame is the pinnacle of success, because what more could you possibly want than adoration?\"",
      "Roan does admit that the admiration of strangers is more \"addictive\" than she'd expected.",
      "\"Like, I understand why I'm so scared to lose this feeling.",
      "\"It's so scary to think that one day people will not care about you the same way as they do right now - and I think [that idea] lives in women's brains a lot different than men's.\"",
      "Ultimately, she decides, success and failure are \"out of my control\". Instead, she wants to make good choices.",
      "\"If I can look back and say, 'I did not crumble under the weight of expectation, and I did not stand for being abused or blackmailed', [then] at least I stayed true to my heart,\" she says.",
      "\"Like I said before, there are always options.\"",

      "For the second time in the seven years since his death, Mac Miller fans have the chance to listen to a new album.",
      "The US rapper was 26 when he died from an accidental overdose in 2018. Friends say he was lost in his prime and fans' hunger for new music has remained.",
      "Balloonerism, released on Friday to generally positive reviews, follows the 2020 posthumous release of Circles, made of unfinished work completed after he died.",
      "Collaborators say the studio tracks first laid down more than 10 years ago used in the new album have barely been changed.",
      "Some of those who worked on the new release - who were present at the recording sessions - describe the finished product as haunting, raw, and unpolished.",
      "Circles was a big success but a mixed reception to recent posthumous albums from other artists has caused critics to question whether less is more when it comes to releasing music after death.",
      "Audio engineer Josh Berg was in the LA studio, known as the Sanctuary, where Mac wrote and recorded all his material between 2013-2014.",
      "\"I always hoped this day would come,\" he says of Ballonerism's final release.",
      "\"And now it's kind of sad.",
      "\"Everything except one thing is amazing about this situation. It really makes me feel his loss.\"",
      "Mac Miller, real name Malcolm James McCormick, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and started making music at school.",
      "His debut album, Blue Slide Park, was the first independently released record to top the Billboard 200 chart in 16 years and all of his later albums followed the same path to the top five in the US.",
      "He wrote Balloonerism between labels in 2014 and producer Eric Dan, who worked with Mac since he was a teenager, tells Newsbeat he was \"just starting to come into his own\".",
      "\"That period was like a creative renaissance for him,\" he says. \"He was a creation machine.\"",
      "Josh says so many projects were started in that time but Balloonerism was among the ones that came closest to release, with Mac even getting to the stage of commissioning artwork.",
      "While Circles was \"in pretty rough shape\" when he died and finished off by producers, Eric says Balloonerism is largely untouched.",
      "\"We made a conscious decision to keep things as they were and not go back and 'fix' mistakes, tune things or add anything.",
      "\"The rough edges were part of its charm and highlighted where Mac was creatively at that time.\"",
      "Josh describes the result of leaving in those imperfections as an album that's \"raw and emotional\", even \"extremely haunting\" in the context of Mac's death.",
      "\"Once you start pulling everything apart and dusting it off, it starts to lose its magic,\" Josh says.",
      "\"It's beautiful to release an album that's not so scoured of imperfection, that's authentic and real.\"",
      "It's that question of authenticity which troubles some fans about music released after an artist has died.",
      "In 2024, posthumous albums released by the families of SOPHIE and Juice WRLD had mixed responses. While SOPHIE's was named Rough Trade's album of the year, some critics considered it too \"safe\" for such a pioneering and experimental talent.",
      "Robin Murray, editor-in-chief at Clash magazine, reviewed Juice WRLD's third posthumous album, The Party Never Ends.",
      "The US rapper died two years after Mac, also from an accidental overdose, leaving a cache of unreleased music but Robin tells Newsbeat the latest album sounded like \"unfinished demos that had been stretched\".",
      "\"Releasing an album or body of work after an artist has passed away is an incredibly difficult and complex task,\" he says.",
      "\"There's no telling how the artist would have proceeded with that work, if they would have proceeded at all.\"",
      "Josh and Eric agree it's fair to question how Mac might have changed Balloonerism but they both believe it was always his plan to be release it when the time was right.",
      "Eric also says that after \"bootleg\" versions of the album were leaked, it was important an official release, in line with Mac's most up-to-date track lists, allowed the family to regain control of the album.",
      "\"I can certainly see where people have concerns with it,\" Josh accepts.",
      "\"I was less concerned but now in this process maybe I shared more of that concern as we got closer.",
      "\"He would always change the playlist, he would always do something I'd never expect, so it will never really be true to him.\"",
      "'Brushing away the myth'",
      "The release of Balloonerism coincides with what would have been Mac's 33rd birthday and a companion film was shared alongside it.",
      "At a sold-out screening in London, fan Conor says it felt like the last opportunity to \"share thanks for the artist that he was\".",
      "Most of the fans who spoke to Newsbeat say they had no reservations about the album being released but Conor says the passage of more than 10 years \"does make it more complex\".",
      "\"It's sad, at some point it does have to end but I'm all here for it for now.\"",
      "Another fan, Carolina, says she \"didn't give it too much thought, because I'm just a sucker\".",
      "\"I just want more, everything he made and was ready to be released, I'd like to be released.\"",
      "Robin says the success of Circles was in part due to how closely Mac's family worked with people who knew him.",
      "Eric, for example, worked on all his music and knew him for a decade, while Josh \"pretty much lived in the studio\" with Mac during the writing and recording sessions.",
      "He says the family \"really lead the way in showing how tenderness and care can be accomplished within posthumous projects\".",

      "However Robin says it's important to know when enough is enough.",

      "Your next Traitors fix",
      "Hot on the heels of the UK final on Friday, the third season of The Traitors US is arriving on BBC iPlayer.",
      "Five episodes will be available to stream on Friday, after which there will be a new episode available every Friday.",
      "Unlike the UK series, the contestants on the US version are celebrities. The series two cast was primarily made up of US reality stars - with the additions of British Love Island winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu and former House of Commons Speaker John Bercow.",
      "Players competing for the cash prize this time include Britney Spears' ex-husband Sam Asghari, former WWE wrestler Nikki Garcia and British aristocrat Lord Ivar Mountbatten.",

      "Jade Thirlwall talks new music... and Harry Styles",
      "Jade Thirlwall waited the longest of any member of Little Mix to release solo music, but she's given fans plenty to get stuck into recently.",
      "In July, she dropped debut single Angel of My Dreams, and she kicked off 2025 with a banger: a dance-pop track called It girl, which appears to take a swipe at the wider music industry.",
      "On Tuesday, she's appearing on Louis Theroux's podcast, which will be available on Spotify.",
      "I'm told it's going to be a \"candid\" conversation, in which Jade will discuss her early career and the X Factor era - including a date with Harry Styles.",
      "Other topics on the agenda include fellow bandmate Jesy Nelson's departure from Little Mix, her experience of an eating disorder, her boyfriend (Rizzle Kicks star Jordan Stephens, in case you haven't been following), and her new album.",
      "However good it is, it surely can't top her interview on podcast Sidetracked last year, in which she confessed she had a \"poo incident\" on stage with Little Mix. You can listen back to that on BBC Sounds.",
      "Is The Brutalist too long?",
      "The Brutalist has already won three prizes at the Golden Globes, and picked up nine Bafta film nominations.",
      "The film, which is also tipped to be a big contender at the Oscars, is released in UK cinemas this Friday.",
      "Starring Adrien Brody, Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones, it tells the tale of a Hungarian architect who is hired by a wealthy American after World War Two.",
      "It's also really long: 215 minutes including a 15-minute intermission in the middle.",
      "I grew up watching Bollywood films, so a lengthy film doesn't spook me.",
      "But my colleague Lizo Mzimba asked director Brady Corbet for his take on the duration.",
      "\"I think that's something you can't concern yourself with. You have to do what's right for the project,\" he said.",
      "\"The length of a movie is similar to the length of a book, a double album, a painting on a big canvas. I love small portraits and I love [German painter] Anselm Kiefer. For me, there's a space for both of them.",
      "\"And at the end of the day, especially if the film has an intermission, it's only 100 minutes on each side so it's not so bad.\"",
      "Lizo's also interviewed the stars of the show - watch out for that later this week.",
      "Have you experienced Eusexua?",
      "FKA twigs coined the phrase Eusexua to describe a feeling of euphoria that is like transcending the human form.",
      "Just \"don't call it love\", she writes, in her song by the same name.",
      "Eusexua is also the title of her upcoming third studio album, due out on Friday.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 00:57:01 GMT",
    "summary": "Prince Harry\u2019s legal battle against British tabloids for allegedly unlawfully intruding into his life reaches its most important moment on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Unless there is a sudden and staggering plot twist, Prince Harry's legal battle against British tabloids for allegedly unlawfully intruding into his life reaches its most important moment on Tuesday when his claims against The Sun and the long-closed News of the World, come to trial.",
      "The plot twist would be a settlement of his mammoth case against their parent, News Group Newspapers [NGN], the British press arm of the media empire founded by Rupert Murdoch.",
      "Is it likely? You would get better odds on Harry and Meghan announcing a weekly lifestyle column for The Sun on Sunday.",
      "This will be the first time that News Group Newspapers has had to defend itself against allegations that its journalists and executives across the whole organisation were involved in or knew about unlawful newsgathering techniques.",
      "If it were to lose, and lose badly, a finding from the court of corporate-level wrongdoing would be in stark contrast to a longstanding defence that phone hacking was limited to bad apples in one now-closed title.",
      "The prince's allegations of tabloid wrongdoing date back to 1996. Harry and his brother Prince William first became aware they may have been targeted in 2006.",
      "Back then, texting was still in its infancy and everybody left voicemails - and some tabloid journalists realised it was rather easy to listen in.",
      "Clive Goodman, a News of the World journalist, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, were arrested, and later jailed, for intercepting voicemails on phones belonging to the princes' aides.",
      "Prince Harry says as the scandal deepened, he held on for NGN to settle Royal Family claims under a \"secret agreement\" to avoid embarrassment in court. NGN's lawyers have said this is \"Alice in Wonderland stuff\" - and the court has ruled it hasn't seen evidence of such a backroom deal.",
      "All these years on, the Duke of Sussex seems in no mood to give up on what has become a crusade against tabloid journalism. And so his case is going ahead - and what happens over the next two months may define both the prince's legacy and the future of a British journalism institution.",
      "NGN long ago apologised for unlawful practices at the News of the World and closed it down in 2011. It denies similar claims against The Sun - and the duke's wider allegation of a corporate-wide cover-up.",
      "It has settled cases brought by some 1,300 claimants, to the tune of around \u00a31bn including legal costs.",
      "That means it has seen off potential trials from people who say the newspapers ran stories that could have only been written with access to private or confidential sources of information that could not have been publicly known.",
      "Those settlements left just two claimants - one of them Prince Harry.",
      "When he launched his claim, he alleged that more than 200 articles published by NGN between 1996 and 2011 contained information gathered by illegal means. The trial will look at a sample of around 30 stories in detail.",
      "Some of those will cover ground trodden in his successful Mirror Group case in 2023 and, just like in that case, he will give evidence in person.",
      "There will be hours of analysis of how the Sun got scoops such as \"Emotional Harry rang Chelsy at midnight\" - a story it ran almost twenty years ago to the day about his then girlfriend, Chelsy Davy.",
      "There will be further separate allegations from the second claimant, Lord (Tom) Watson. The former Labour MP says his phone was targeted around the time he was investigating the Murdoch newspapers at the height of the scandal almost 15 years ago.",
      "Mr Justice Fancourt will decide if any of the NGN articles were the product of unlawful information gathering, such as information tricked or \"blagged\" out of phone companies by private investigators.",
      "In Prince Harry's case, he will not rule on whether there was any phone hacking because Prince Harry ran out of legal time to bring those allegations to trial.",
      "None of this is going to be simple in court.",
      "The judge had repeatedly expressed his frustration, referring to the two sides as entrenched well-resourced armies refusing to give any ground to each other.",
      "And at no stage has Prince Harry looked like he was going to settle, despite the enormous financial hit he faces by not doing so.",
      "If a claimant turns down an offer of settlement and is later awarded less in damages by a judge, they have to pay the legal costs of both sides.",
      "Prince Harry has been very open about the hit he will take and why he was pressing ahead.",
      "\"The goal is accountability. It's really that simple,\" he told an audience at a New York Times event in December.",
      "News Group has, in simple terms, three lines of defence. It will firstly argue that Harry has run out of time to bring allegations of unlawful information gathering.",
      "This saw off his mobile phone hacking claim.",
      "Secondly, its lawyers will test, article-by-article, the duke's claims that the information in them came from dodgy sources.",
      "Thirdly, News Group has lined up witnesses to rebut Prince Harry and Lord Watson's broader allegation that the top brass knew what was going on and were party to the mass destruction of purportedly incriminating records in 2011.",
      "While the celebrity focus will inevitably be on the prince when he goes into the witness box, that third allegation of a cover up is the most important element of this trial.",
      "While the hit to Prince Harry's wallet will be big, the damage to NGN's reputation - and that of its executives - would be greater still if the court finds they were involved.",
      "The executives the claimants will accuse of wrongdoing include the current CEO, Rebekah Brooks. She was found not guilty of conspiracy to hack voicemails in the seismic 2014 trial that ended with the jailing of Andy Coulson, her former colleague, News of the World editor and David Cameron's communications chief.",
      "Another is Will Lewis. He played a key role in managing the hacking crisis in 2011. He is now the CEO of the Washington Post - an appointment that has been opposed by many at the newspaper because of this association.",
      "They and others deny wrongdoing.",
      "Will they be giving evidence? A spokesperson for NGN said: \"Both claimants allege unlawful destruction of emails by News International between 2010-2011. This allegation is wrong, unsustainable, and is strongly denied. NGN will be calling a number of witnesses including technologists, lawyers and senior staff to defeat the claim.\"",
      "Exactly what evidence Prince Harry brings to prove this claim - and what NGN says in defence - may define the entire battle.",
      "Tuesday really is the beginning of the end. And someone is going to lose - and lose big."

    "story": [
      "The Traitors is one of the few things getting us through a miserable January. For three nights a week, it feels as if the whole country is living and breathing the cloaks-and-daggers drama.",
      "For the other four painstaking days when the show isn't on air, we're sharing our opinions and theories with everyone from colleagues to strangers online.",
      "But it's not just tactics and contestants viewers are talking about - my group chats are incessantly pinging with questions about what happens behind the scenes, where the cast go once they leave the castle, and whether Charlotte will ever reveal her real accent.",
      "Luckily, we no longer need to ponder most of these questions, as former contestants have been speaking to BBC News about the secret workings of the Traitors castle.",
      "What does a typical day in the castle look like, and what happens before breakfast?",
      "The order in which the contestants arrive at breakfast is a source of tension and speculation on the show.",
      "Series one faithful Maddy Smedley explains that contestants are kept in separate holding rooms when they come to the castle in the morning and are called to go into breakfast individually or as a group.",
      "Similarly, in the evenings, contestants wait in a holding room until a runner comes to individually escort them out of the building and into a car.",
      "Traitor and series two champion Harry Clark says there are no clocks in the castle and contestants have no sense of time.",
      "\"You get picked up in the morning and when filming is over, you get dropped back to the lodgings,\" he explains.",
      "\"I don't know what time the mission starts or when lunch is - we rely on the production team to direct us and in between, we all just sit around and chat.\"",
      "Unlike the hour-long episodes we see, Harry says the days aren't filled with wall-to-wall traitor speculation.",
      "\"I spent most the day talking to Paul about Liverpool and Chelsea or finding out if everyone believes in aliens and obviously that stuff doesn't make the final edit because it's not relevant to the game.\"",
      "Series one faithful Dr Amos Ogunkoya describes his days in the castle as \"a really nice holiday camp, until the roundtable\".",
      "\"Most of the day we're just learning about each others lives and so you become really close to everyone there.\"",
      "Matt Harris, another faithful in series one, says that, while the castle is huge, \"you're not allowed out of sight from the cameras so you can't walk around the grounds\".",
      "\"They set up the rooms like the library and bar especially for the show and you're told by producers which rooms you can go into.\"",
      "How long does the roundtable really last?",
      "The lack of clocks make it hard to know exactly how long anything lasts but the roundtable surely far surpasses its 10 minutes of screen time.",
      "\"At the beginning, there are 22 people,\" says Harry. \"Even if everyone only speaks for 10 minutes, that's more than three hours.\"",
      "As viewers, it can be hard to understand why contestants are so emotional during and after the roundtable, but Harry says it's \"really intense\".",
      "\"Everyone has their own story and you're taking someone's chance of winning money away if they are banished.\"",
      "Maddy says she cried so much on the show that \"the security guards would give me ice every morning to help the puffiness of my face go down\".",
      "Where do contestants sleep?",
      "The exact location of contestants' lodgings remains a mystery to us, and apparently to the cast as well.",
      "\"It's about a 30-minute drive from the castle but you're blindfolded as you approach, so you can't see the car in front or figure out exactly where you are,\" Maddy says.",
      "She explains that the whole production team and cast stay in private lodgings but you're kept apart from everyone \"with military precision\".",
      "\"You're allowed to go for a walk but you have to be accompanied by a runner and each floor is manned by two security guards who ensure you don't leave your room unaccompanied.",
      "\"At first, I was really scared of them because I had watched the Dutch version of the show and in that, the faithful are murdered in their hotel room so every time the guard knocked on my door I thought I was going to leave the game,\" she says.",
      "Harry explains he felt lonely at times in the accommodation, especially as contestants have their phones taken away. \"But I can't complain because I slept easy every night knowing I'd be turning up for breakfast!\"",
      "What do contestants eat?",
      "Every now and then viewers get a quick glimpse of a bowl of fruit at breakfast or someone piling carrots onto their plate at dinner time.",
      "The contestants we spoke to gave the food provided on the show mixed reviews.",
      "Dr Amos says \"the breakfast was horrible, you definitely would not want to eat much of it\" but Matt was more generous and described it as \"decent\".",
      "Harry says \"there was a lot of Scottish food like haggis\" adding that as a fussy eater, he \"wouldn't touch it\".",
      "But luckily for Harry, there was the option to request food.",
      "During the day, he says he ate \"a lot of chicken nuggets and chips\" and, in the evening, he would ask for the \"perfect traitor fuel\" to be delivered to his lodgings - a crisp sandwich.",
      "What happens when contestants are banished or murdered?",
      "If a contestant is banished at the roundtable, they \"really do leave immediately\", according to Maddy.",
      "\"You're taken to do an exit interview straight away and then driven to your hotel to pack your stuff. The next day, I was escorted by security in the morning to the airport and was given my phone back.\"",
      "Maddy says the more stressful way of leaving the show is through murder.",
      "\"You turn up in the morning like you're going to breakfast and you are all waiting in these holding rooms. Eventually, you get called as if you're going to breakfast but instead, they take you to another room where the murder letter is sitting on a chair.",
      "\"It was so stressful.\"",
      "Do producers tell contestants what to say and do?",
      "\"The biggest shock was how unscripted everything is,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "Maddy says the only time producers intervened was to tell her to announce that she was an actor over breakfast.",
      "She explains she'd already shared this with her fellow contestants when they were waiting to be taken back to the hotel and had taken their mics off.",
      "Matt says there were some moments that were guided by producers.",
      "\"Occasionally, people were pulled out and told to go and speak to some other people - it's natural that they guide you into a position to make good TV.\"",
      "\"It's weird at first because there are cameras in your face but after a while, you forget they're there and producers don't ever step in,\" Harry adds.",
      "\"Most rooms also just have cameras in the corner and you have a mic attached to you so sometimes, you don't see any of the producers until the end of the day when they check in on you.\"",
      "Mike Cotton, creative director of the studio that makes The Traitors, told the BBC last year there were cameras \"dotted around every single room\".",
      "\"I'd say there's probably about 50 or 60 of those throughout the living space within the castle.\"",
      "He said a team of camera operators worked in pairs to follow the cast around into different rooms - but at a distance.",
      "At the roundtable, he said the cameras were hidden and some were built into the table itself.",
      "\"The contestants can't see any cameras and that's to keep them immersed as they can only see each other,\" he explained.",
      "What is Claudia Winkleman like?",
      "\"When I met Claudia, I was so nervous because she's so powerful,\" says Harry.",
      "\"I wanted to be a traitor so badly and I thought she'd take no notice of us but actually, she knew everything about everyone.",
      "\"She gets really involved and makes you feel really comfortable.\"",
      "How much does Claudia Winkleman know about the challenges?",
      "\"Very little,\" according to Harry.",
      "\"There's a team that create the missions and everyone else is in the dark about them. I would try off-camera to get them to tell me about it or I'd give them ideas but they wouldn't listen.\"",
      "Claudia recently said her biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables.",
      "\"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head,\" she explained.",
      "How are traitors selected?",
      "Speaking to BBC News and other press last month, Claudia explained there's a team of people who make the decision.",
      "\"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "The team take the players' wishes into consideration and if someone asks not to be a traitor, they wouldn't be picked.",
      "Dr Amos says he made it very clear that he wouldn't appear on the show if he wasn't a faithful.",
      "\"I wanted to take part in the show but as a doctor I think being a traitor and lying to people has real-life consequences as my patients might not trust me.\"",
      "How do you get on The Traitors?",
      "One thing that's clear from speaking to the contestants is applying for the show is hard work.",
      "After firing off your initial written and video applications, you have a number of audiences with producers.",
      "\"They ask you to mainly tell them stories about yourself and your life,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "\"Eventually, if they like you, then you get a phone call a few weeks before [filming starts] to say you're off to Scotland,\" adds Harry.",
      "Where is The Traitors castle?",
      "The Traitors is filmed in Ardross Castle, a 19th Century building about 30 miles north of Inverness.",
      "It is set in about 100 acres of gardens and parkland and has been owned by the McTaggart family since 1983.",
      "Fun fact: its previous owner was Charles William Dyson Perrins whose grandfather, William Perrins (in partnership with John Wheeley Lea) created the recipe for Worcestershire Sauce.",
      "How many people are involved in the production?",
      "Mike Cotton said the crew on location was made up of more than 200 people.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely huge but we film one episode a day,\" he said.",
      "He explained that this team included everyone from producers and camera operators to the art department who worked their magic on interior designing the rooms.",
      "He likened the production to one you might find on set for a Hollywood film.",
      "Dr Amos says that every member of the crew knew who the traitors were.",
      "\"It looks like the faithful are in the majority on the show but in reality, you massively feel in the minority -  everyone down to the psychologist who is there to support you knows who the traitors are.\"",

    "summary": "Apple TV's hit dystopian workplace thriller finally returns after a three-year cliffhanger.",
    "story": [
      "Spoiler warning for season two's opening episode",
      "\"I don't think Mark, in the wildest reaches of his imagination, thought his company could do something as nefarious as faking a death,\" says actor Adam Scott of his character in Apple TV's Severance.",
      "But Mark's is an unusual workplace, to put it mildly.",
      "Employees at biotech conglomerate Lumon Industries are offered the company's pioneering severance programme, a concept inspired by series creator Dan Erickson's desire to escape the mind-numbing drudgery of his office jobs.",
      "Sold as the ultimate work-life balance, the firm's brain microchip procedure splits a person's consciousness and memory into dual existences.",
      "This means when \"severed\" grieving widower Mark Scout and his colleagues take the office lift each morning, their work-self - or \"innie\" - awakens for duty. Once they clock off, their \"outie\" re-emerges, returning to home life blissfully unaware.",
      "But series one's cliffhanger finale - the work of executive producer and director Ben Stiller - saw Mark discover his late wife Gemma may actually still be alive amid a rebellion by his team against their shadowy employers.",
      "The group managed to outsmart floor managers Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) and Milchick (Tramell Tillman) and override the severance system, briefly awakening their real-world bodies. Rebellious sceptic Helly (Britt Lowery) also learned a shattering truth about her outie's company ties.",
      "Fans have been waiting almost three years to find out what happens next, and on Friday, Severance returned to Apple TV for its anticipated second season.",
      "The show got critical acclaim in 2022 to become one of Apple's breakout hits - earning 14 Emmy nominations and a Writers Guild award. It helped, too, that the show arrived at a time when the pandemic had fundamentally shifted the audience's own relationship with office life.",
      "But the Hollywood writers' strike and behind-the scenes issues (resolved for Stiller to return to produce and direct), forced the wait that left audiences hungry for answers.",
      "I ask Scott, who, fittingly, has never worked a real office job but played many office on-screen roles, how that cliffhanger has affected his latest character's psyche on the show's return.",
      "\"Mark is far more self-possessed and septical, possibly, of this company,\" says the 51-year-old, who played manager Ben Wyatt in comedy Parks and Recreation.",
      "Last season, trapped inside Lumon's brutalist architecture and sanitised walls, crunching mysterious numbers for the \"Macrodata Refinement team\", the team was fed cultish Soviet-esque propaganda about company founder Kier Eagan and his family.",
      "Where previously, \"Lumon and Kier and all of its rules and and regulations made up [the innies'] identities\", Scott says their brief escape into the outside world and the chance to taste their alternate existences has \"filled them up\".",
      "Rebel, rebel",
      "If season one darkly satirised corporate greed and rebellion, season two lays bare disingenuous corporation damage control and co-option, in ways once again sure to spark Reddit theories. Nothing is quite as it seems.",
      "Apple need the series to be popular, too, with each episode costing $20m (\u00a316m) to make according to Bloomberg - a big investment given plans to rein in spending after years of streaming services disrupting the market.",
      "In yesterday's season opener, we saw Mark's innie (newly sentient after his team's brief escape into the outside world) return to work to find his team replaced.",
      "Floor manager Milchick explains that in the five months since the uprising, fellow manager Harmony (known to workers as Ms. Cobel) has been fired, with himself promoted in her place. The team is also being promised workplace reform - including improved staff perks.",
      "After all, nothing better conveyed Lumon's unnerving forced fun than its heavily rationed waffle, melon and single-track dance parties. An HR video even reframes the team's rebellion positively, encouraging staff to \"praise Kier\" for the uprising.",
      "Mark's attempts to reunite his team are thwarted by Milchick. But newly empowered by his trip to the outside world, he decides to challenge the shadowy forces that run the company directly.",
      "This push and pull between Mark and a faceless employer may strike a chord with those being forced to go back into the office as companies clamp down on remote working post-pandemic. This month, the bank JPMorgan Chase reportedly closed comments on an intranet page announcing its return-to-work edict, following a tide of negative responses.",
      "This new series comes at a time when the balance of power is arguably shifting in favour of employers again, after a total of 100 million Americans quit their jobs in 2021 and 2022 in what Stanford economics professor Nicholas Bloom called the Great Resignation.",
      "Disillusionment has sparked cultural shifts amongst office workers. The term 'quiet quitting' has emerged, referring to doing the bare minimum in a job. Similarly \"late-stage capitalism\" has gained traction on social media, not for its Marxist roots, but to describe perceived inequalities, societal burnout and a faltering system.",
      "The board will (not) see you now",
      "In series two, we see how Lumon's disorientating, unforgiving corporate culture and its deceptive pleasantries affects those with power too. Floor managers Milchick and newly-demoted Harmony become victims as well as enforcers.",
      "Arquette, who won an Oscar for Richard Linklater's 2014 film Boyhood, says her character is \"furious\" that the corporation, in demoting her, has failed to recognise her loyalty.",
      "Tillman similarly adds that whilst it is unclear whether Milchick betrayed Harmony, he bears a \"heavy responsibility\" on his shoulders. As her replacement, he must now both placate the innies and please a board who \"do not understand what it takes to do the job\".",
      "Unlike Scott, Tillman worked in corporate office roles prior to becoming an actor and landing his breakthrough role as company man Milchick. He says he was never as \"arrogant or ambitious\" as his character, but admits to occasionally being \"adventurous\" in navigating office politics. This either worked well or, sometimes, landed him \"flat on my face\".",
      "Tillman equally recognises Milchick's isolated experience as the sole black managerial figure. Steering clear of spoilers, he says we begin to understand Milchick's experience of being \"othered by the company he serves\".",
      "\"It really speaks to how some organisations and some corporations, in their attempt to be inclusive, miss the boat,\" he adds.",
      "Arquette continues: \"I feel every few years there's a new doctrine throughout the corporate space - some kind of PR switcharoo [about] how to be current and different than we were in the past.",
      "\"I think a lot of times things do need to change, but sometimes it doesn't really feel genuine.\"",

    "title": "David Lynch: Mind-bending Twin Peaks director who embraced the weird",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 06:08:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The visionary director's belief in American beauty and horror being two sides of the same coin was perfected in the iconic 1990 TV series.",
    "story": [
      "David Lynch once said he was inspired to become a filmmaker when, while painting, he inexplicably heard a gust of wind and saw the artwork move on canvas.",
      "The moment defined his obsession with \"seeing paintings move\", but also his flair for the bizarre - twisting realities on the small and big screen for almost 40 years.",
      "The 78-year-old US director, who has died months after announcing an emphysema diagnosis, became the contemporary face of weird, unsettling worlds often hidden within everyday society  - from TV series Twin Peaks to films like Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire.",
      "A self-professed daydreamer, Lynch burst onto the scene via the midnight movie circuit with 1977's Eraserhead. The disorientating horror, a comment on male paranoia, set the layered template that ran through his work.",
      "Four decades later, he lived to see his style immortalised as an adjective in the Oxford dictionary. Lynchian, it reads, blurs \"surreal or sinister elements with the mundane\" - an accolade fitting of the four-time Oscar nominee turned lifetime achievement recipient, whose character was as big as his films.",
      "David Keith Lynch was born in Missoula, Montana on January 20, 1946. The son of a research scientist for the Department of Agriculture, he spent much of his early life moving around from state to state with his brother and sister.",
      "However, Lynch's parents encouraged his artistic ambitions from an early age. Speaking to Rolling Stone in 1990, he said his mother \"saved\" him by encouraging him to draw on scrap paper rather than using colouring books, where \"the whole idea is to stay between the lines\".",
      "This ethos inspired his films, tinged by a rebellious streak which he teased lasted from the age of 14 to 30. \"People rebel that long these days\", he reasoned, \"because we're built to live longer\".",
      "Youthful frustration at the calm of suburban life left him craving for \"something out of the ordinary to happen\" to challenge the superficiality of 1950s family ideals - a dark dream his films and shows brought to life.",
      "Lynch's black-and-white debut feature Eraserhead achieved this vision far more successfully than his years at art school, with its central character descending into madness after fathering a terrifying baby.",
      "Critics were left confused, but its late-night cinema success sparked a breakthrough when one audience member recommended him to Mel Brooks, who asked him to helm Elephant Man.",
      "Co-written by Lynch, the film's cast of eventual screen icons, including John Hurt as Merrick and Anthony Hopkins, transformed the story of stigma into an emotional, critical hit, outpacing the original stage play.",
      "It saw Lynch receive Oscar nominations for best director and adapted screenplay, as part of the film's eight nominations that included best picture.",
      "But if Hollywood thought it had found a new blockbuster master, Tinseltown quickly discovered Lynch had no interest in playing mainstream with his 1984 adaptation of sci-fi epic Dune.",
      "Featuring questionable special effects, costumes and rock star Sting lathered in baby oil, the Guardian's Charles Bramesco wrote that Lynch's experiments left the franchise \"radioactive for decades\". \"I'm proud of everything except Dune,\" Lynch would later tell a YouTube Q&A, while admitting elsewhere it almost \"killed\" his career.",
      "Coffee, cherry pie... and Twin Peaks",
      "The wounds began to heal, however, when he returned to double down on his signature style - placing his fascination with America's dirty underbelly in his sights.",
      "Blue Velvet, starring Kyle MacLachlan from Dune, followed a small-town boy caught up in the underworld after he discovered a severed ear. Brutal and violent in part, it divided critics but won Lynch his second Oscar nod for best director.",
      "\"This is the way America is to me,\" Lynch would later describe the movie in his book Lynch on Lynch. \"There's a very innocent, naive quality to life, and there's a horror and a sickness as well\".",
      "He won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival for romance Wild at Heart in 1990, starring Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe.",
      "But it was Lynch's belief in American beauty and horror being two sides of the same coin, perfected in his TV project Twin Peaks released the same year, that came to define him.",
      "On paper, the unsettling drama explored the murky goings-on in the US logging town following the murder of teenage beauty queen Laura Palmer, hauntingly brought to life by Sheryl Lee.",
      "But viewers were truly captivated by what it offered onscreen: a dreamlike nightmare of wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, including FBI agent Dale Cooper, again played by Kyle MacLachlan, in the apparent comfort of picket-fenced America - cherry pie and coffee included - before unflinchingly reaching into living rooms with its chilling undercurrent of sexual abuse and murder. It was one that had no prior place on US TV.",
      "The ABC show won three Golden Globe awards in 1991, including best TV drama series and best actor in a TV drama for MacLachlan.",
      "\"Without Twin Peaks, and its big-bang expansion of the possibilities of television, half your favourite shows wouldn't exist,\" wrote James Parker for The Atlantic.",
      "The show, he continued, \"effectively renegotiated TV's contract with its audience\".",
      "It mattered little that the second season faltered after the killer was revealed. TV was no longer safe, it was viscerally alive - big screen ideas and production values somehow beamed into living rooms in an age when the silver screen still ruled.",
      "In 1992, viewers were taken back to Twin Peaks with a prequel feature film, Fire Walk With Me, but nothing quite matched the original run.",
      "When the nation asked \"Who killed Laura Palmer?\", it wasn't just about solving the mystery, but finding sanctuary from rotten realities society would rather ignore.  Lynch had found his darkness.",
      "He would eventually shift focus back to the big screen to attack Hollywood's devilish tricks of fame, glamour, deceit and identity loss, in films unofficially known as his Los Angeles trilogy.",
      "This began with 1997's Lost Highway, before 2001's Mulholland Drive - perhaps the closest in aesthetic to Twin Peaks.",
      "The psychological drama received critical acclaim, scoring Lynch his third best director Oscar nomination and scooping the best director gong at Cannes. In recent years it has also been recognised for its queer themes, particularly between Naomi Watts' and Laura Harring's characters, that challenged traditional Hollywood storytelling of the time.",
      "Last came 2006's Inland Empire, Lynch's final feature film, which proved as mind-melting as ever - showing Hollywood star culture no mercy.",
      "As Mike Muncer told BBC Arts' Inside Cinema: \"Lynch lures us in with the promise of familiar, traditional genre thrills and mysteries as a safety net, before that weirdness starts to creep in.",
      "\"Eventually, the mystery box is opened, revealing the darker, more sinister story that Lynch has actually been telling us all along.\"",
      "Cult icon",
      "In his latter years Lynch enjoyed revered cult status. In 2017, he directed Twin Peaks: The Return, a new series set 25 years after the events of the original show, with much of the same cast.",
      "At the same time, the show's legacy continues to endure, inspiring dramas like True Detective and 2023's critically acclaimed Playstation survival horror game Alan Wake II.",
      "Away from the camera, Lynch admitted he had sometimes struggled to balance the \"tricky business\" of fatherhood with his career.",
      "He welcomed four children - Jennifer, Austin, Riley and Lula - with ex-wives Peggy Reavey, Mary Fisk and Mary Sweeney, and estranged wife Emily Stofle.",
      "\"I love all my children and we get along great, but in the early years, before you can have a relationship of talking to them, it's tough,\" he told Vulture. \"The work is the main thing, and I know I've caused suffering because of that. But at the same time I have huge love for the kids.\"",
      "Although Lynch never did return to feature film directing to give himself another shot at an elusive Oscar win, he was granted an honorary lifetime achievement statuette by the Academy in 2019. He also made a cameo in Steven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical 2022 film, The Fablemans, playing filmmaker John Ford.",
      "His artistic pursuits increasingly diversified toward the end of his life, from his original passion for painting to music. Just last year, he released Cellophane Memories, an album with Chrystabell. This added to his previous work producing music videos for artists like Moby and Nine Inch Nails.",
      "Why David Lynch's Mulholland Drive is the greatest film of the 21st CenturyDavid Lynch interview: 'Even in the so-called dark things, there's beauty'",
      "Why David Lynch's Mulholland Drive is the greatest film of the 21st Century",
      "David Lynch interview: 'Even in the so-called dark things, there's beauty'",
      "Discussing his emphysema diagnosis last summer, he said he was in \"excellent shape\" and would \"never retire\".",
      "He added the diagnosis was the \"price to pay\" for his smoking habit, although he didn't regret the enjoyment it gave him.",
      "But his condition deteriorated within months. In a November interview, with People magazine, Lynch said he needed oxygen to walk.",
      "However his ideas live on, as unique as the way he described thinking of them.",
      "Speaking in conversation with musician Patti Smith for BBC Newsnight in 2014, he said: \"I get ideas in fragments. It's as if in the other room there's a puzzle - all the pieces are together.",
      "\"But in my room, they just flip one piece at a time into me.\""

    "story": [
      "Dame Joan Plowright, who has died aged 95, was one of Britain's finest stage actresses - and later found fame on the cinema screen, although she largely preferred stage work.",
      "The Tony and Golden Globe winner once said movies were a fall-back to pay the bills, remarking: \"You do films if the roof needs mending.\"",
      "Theatre audiences enjoyed her versatility and good humour, and her 1961 Tony-winning Broadway role A Taste of Honey saw her play a troubled teenager, with Angela Lansbury as her mother.",
      "Other notable stage roles include Saint Joan in 1963 and Saturday, Sunday, Monday a decade later, along with films including 1992's Enchanted April and Tea with Mussolini in 1999.",
      "She was also married to acting great Sir Laurence Olivier for 28 years, until his death in 1989.",
      "After he died, Plowright continued to act into her 80s, until failing sight forced her retirement.",
      "Joan Ann Plowright was born on 29 October 1929 in Brigg, Lincolnshire.",
      "Her mother, Daisy, was a keen amateur actor and by the age of three, her daughter had taken to the stage.",
      "She went to Scunthorpe Grammar School before studying drama at the Bristol Old Vic.",
      "Her mother encouraged her choice of career, albeit with brutal candour.",
      "\"You're no oil painting,\" said Daisy, \"but you've got the spark. Just thank God you've got my legs, and not your father's.\"",
      "She made her stage debut as a professional actress in Croydon in 1948, and by 1956 she had joined the Royal Court theatre in London.",
      "At the time, the Royal Court was a hotbed of new talent, specialising in controversial works. It was also the spiritual birthplace of the kitchen-sink drama.",
      "Plowright gained recognition in a series of productions penned by this group of Angry Young Men, in roles that relied on acting ability rather than mere glamour.",
      "As the daughter of a Lincolnshire newspaper editor, she was far from working-class - but her down-to-earthiness and emotional honesty helped bring British theatre up to date.",
      "In 1957, she co-starred with Sir Laurence Olivier in a production of John Osborne's play The Entertainer.",
      "Olivier, who was playing Archie Rice, was at the peak of his acting career and considered something of a matinee idol.",
      "Plowright played his daughter, and the actors' mutual respect led to romance. \"Nothing is so sexy in a man as talent,\" she observed.",
      "She was initially cautious about a relationship with him - Olivier was 22 years older and already one half of Britain's most celebrated theatrical couple, married to Vivien Leigh.",
      "Plowright herself was married to fellow actor Roger Gage.",
      "But Leigh, Sir Laurence's second wife, who was troubled by mental illness,  divorced him in 1960.",
      "Plowright and her husband divorced the same year.",
      "A year later, Olivier married Plowright in Connecticut - around the same time she won a Tony award on Broadway for her role in A Taste of Honey.",
      "The couple were soon appearing together in a series of plays in Chichester, West Sussex, including a notable staging of Uncle Vanya.",
      "The Guardian's Michael Billington called it \"one of the great Chekhov experiences of the 20th Century\" and that it \"brought tears to my eyes\".",
      "They went on to have three children, but their marriage was not without its difficulties.",
      "\"He has extremes of behaviour, which you understand,\" she later said. \"You just find a way not to be swept overboard by his demons.\"",
      "Their relationship also led her to refuse for five years to appear at the National Theatre, where her husband was director from 1962\u20131973.",
      "The actress felt  she would have been vulnerable to accusations of favouritism.",
      "Eventually though, she took a contract with the theatre for a decade, in far grander roles than those at the Royal Court.",
      "By now, her husband had been elevated to the peerage - which made her Lady Olivier - but she didn't use the title.",
      "Plowright won a Golden Globe and was Oscar-nominated for her appearance in the 1991 film Enchanted April.",
      "In fact, she won two Golden Globes in one year - the other coming for HBO TV movie Stalin.",
      "Her other films included Three Sisters in 1970 and The Merchant of Venice in 1973 - both opposite her husband and both based on National Theatre productions.",
      "She also played Mrs Fairfax in 1996's Jane Eyre, and her range went far beyond the classics in films like Dennis the Menace, Last Action Hero and 101 Dalmatians.",
      "She also took a role in the 1990 black comedy I Love You to Death, with Kevin Kline and Tracey Ullman.",
      "In 1989, Lord Olivier died of kidney failure , at the age of 82.",

      "Dame Joan found work a great solace following her husband's death, appearing in a dozen films between 2000 and 2010.",
      "They included 2003's I Am David, about a boy who escapes a gulag in Bulgaria, and the comedy Bringing Down the House, starring Steve Martin, from the same year.",
      "However, she clearly saw the silver screen as a poor cousin of the theatre.",
      "\"One can't pretend that most film dialogue is all that challenging,\" she said. \"You do films if the roof needs mending.\"",
      "As if in agreement, the theatre in her native Scunthorpe renamed itself in her honour.",
      "Her chief obstacle to more theatre work was her eyesight - she had macular degeneration, which made the stage increasingly difficult. In 2014, it forced her retirement from all types of acting.",
      "Four years later, she appeared alongside three old friends - Maggie Smith, Eileen Atkins and Judi Dench - in a BBC Arena film, Nothing Like a Dame.",
      "The grandes dames of British theatre reminisced about their lives and careers, with searing honesty and humility.",
      "Filmed in the garden of the home she had shared with Olivier, Dame Joan spoke candidly about how she had tried to avoid playing Cleopatra at the National Theatre, feeling that she would be mocked for her lack of beauty.",

      "\"I don't know if I'd have done it for myself, but with my kids I had to love her from a distance. In the last few months I took them to see her separately, kind of to say goodbye, and I'm at peace with that. I don't feel any guilt, it was just responsible parenting on my part.",
      "\"I love her, but, and I know this sounds heartless, it's also a relief not to worry about trouble coming to my door anymore.\"",
      "As a teenager, Wilson threw himself into two things - music and alcohol. Both remained with him long after his teenage years had faded away.",

      "On Monday, the government announced another seven projects had been added to this priority list, with building work starting by 2029.",
      "But 18 were to be put back, with work starting in two phases from 2032 and 2035 - and some in the later group warned it may even take until 2039.",

    "published": "Mon, 20 Jan 2025 16:01:04 GMT",
    "summary": "New weight-loss drugs have broad health benefits but also come with risks, researchers warn.",
    "story": [
      "The first study to assess how weight-loss drugs affect the whole of human health has discovered an \"eye-opening\" impact on the body, researchers say.",
      "The analysis, involving about two million people, linked the drugs to better heart health, fewer infections, a lower risk of drug abuse and fewer cases of dementia.",
      "The US researchers also warned the drugs were \"not without risk\" and seemed to increase joint pain and potentially deadly inflammation in the pancreas.",
      "However, the results need very careful interpretation.",
      "Weight-loss drugs have exploded in popularity - but a full understanding of everything they touch in the body is still coming together.",
      "\"This is new territory,\" said lead researcher Dr Ziyad al-Aly, clinical epidemiologist at Washington University.",
      "Initially, they were a proven treatment for type 2 diabetes. Then, weight loss was noticed as a significant side-effect - and Ozempic and Wegovy became household names.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "The study used data on US veterans with type 2 diabetes, some of whom were given Ozempic or Wegovy and some more standard drugs - to measure their effect on 175 other illnesses.",
      "There appeared to be a significant boon to heart health, with lower levels of heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and high blood pressure, in those taking the new weight-loss drugs.",
      "They also cut the risk of substance abuse (including alcohol, opioids and cannabis) as well as reducing schizophrenia, suicidal thoughts and seizures.",
      "Despite the study being short, and people taking the drugs for only 3.5 years because of how new they are, it reported a 12% reduction in Alzheimer's disease.",
      "There was also less liver cancer, muscle pain and chronic kidney disease as well as a noted reduction in bacterial infections and fever.",
      "On the flip side, people were more likely to have problems in their digestive system. Feeling sick, tummy pain, inflammation in the stomach, diverticulitis (bulges in the intestines that can be painful) and haemorrhoids were more common on Ozempic or Wegovy.",
      "'Definitely eye-opening'",
      "The data, published in the journal Nature Medicine, also showed low blood pressure, including fainting, headaches, disturbed sleep, kidney stones, inflammation in the kidneys and a range of bone or joint pains, including arthritis, became more frequent.",
      "\"It was definitely eye-opening for me to see all these different hits in different organ systems,\" Dr Aly told BBC News.",
      "The explanations for the drugs' seemingly wide-ranging impact are both obvious and mysterious.",

      "Dr Baraitser explained: \"After ovulation your temperature goes up - but by a very small amount.",
      "\"To pick up a difference this small, you have to measure your temperature whenever the app tells you to, often daily, and you need to do this before you have got out of bed in the morning and before you have eaten or have had anything to drink.

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:01:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a hit. The question is why, and what can be done about it?",
    "story": [
      "Covid vaccines saved lives. Lots of them. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) now puts the number at 475,000 in the UK with many more kept out of hospital or off a ventilator.",
      "The jabs were a \"scientific miracle\" we were told at the time, our best hope of life returning to normal after months of lockdown restrictions. But something has happened in the years since. Research suggests confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a significant hit.",
      "\"It's the great paradox of the pandemic,\" says Dr Simon Williams, a public health researcher at Swansea University.",
      "\"One of the most successful innovations in public health history, the rapid development of Covid vaccines, has actually had the effect of reducing public confidence in vaccination.\"",
      "In 2023 around 70% of UK adults said that vaccinations were safe and effective, down sharply from 90% in 2018, according to research from the Vaccine Confidence Project, run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).",
      "This is very much part of a worldwide trend with 52 of the 55 countries polled seeing a drop in confidence since 2019.",
      "And regular polling carried out by YouGov suggests adults are increasingly likely to say that vaccines have harmful side effects that are not being disclosed to the public. The proportion saying that statement is \"probably\" or \"definitely\" true rose to 30% in 2024 from 19% in 2019.",
      "At the same time, childhood vaccination rates have fallen further below recommended levels over the last five years, continuing a longer-term trend.",
      "\"Vaccines are always our best defence against infectious, communicable diseases,\" adds Dr Williams. \"A few percentage drops in the proportion of children covered can make a real difference.\"",
      "So why is there increased distrust in vaccination - and can anything be done to change that?",
      "The sudden 'sea change' in attitudes",
      "The long-running Covid inquiry has already looked at pandemic planning and the impact on the NHS. This week, though, it opened hearings into the vaccine rollout across the UK, from take-up of the jabs, to their safety, to the way they were marketed to the public.",
      "Dr Helen Wall, a GP from Bolton, saw the shift in vaccines attitudes over the pandemic first-hand.",
      "In May 2021 the town became the centre of national attention; Covid infections  more than quadrupled in three weeks driven by the new Delta variant. A huge vaccine drive was ordered with army medics staffing mobile units. Dr Wall led the rollout, as clinical director of the local NHS commissioning board.",
      "\"People were coming out and making tea and coffee for people in the line,\" she says. \"There was this real feeling of camaraderie.\"",
      "But around the middle of 2021, she noticed a sudden \"sea change\" in attitudes.",
      "\"Patients would start to say to me, 'why should I trust you, you work for them, you're being paid by them, you're part of the government'.",
      "\"We very quickly went from being lifesavers to just another part of the system that no-one trusted in some spheres.\"",
      "Before long, protestors appeared outside local clinics with placards trying to convince people not get jabbed, and Dr Wall says that she received death threats.",
      "Nearly four years on, she reflects: \"I think what Covid has done is amplified a confidence issue that was already there and ramped up some of the doubts and question-marks for people.\"",
      "From smallpox to MMR",
      "But vaccine hesitancy certainly did not start with the pandemic. The current wave of scepticism is the latest rekindling of an angry debate going back to the dawn of vaccination in 1796 when Edward Jenner created the smallpox vaccine.",
      "In the 1890s huge crowds protested in Leicester against mandatory smallpox vaccinations. Then in the 1970s the diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough jab was linked to brain injury in children, before later being found safe.",
      "In 1998 British doctor Andrew Wakefield published his now infamous research paper falsely claiming the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was responsible for rising rates of autism in children.",
      "Wakefield's research, described as the most damaging scientific fraud of all time, has since been thoroughly discredited and he was struck off the doctors' register.",
      "But the damage was done. The number of measles cases in England and Wales jumped to 2,032 in 2012 from just 56 in 1998. It took more than a decade for MMR uptake to return to anything like normal and that debunked link with autism still gets repeated today.",
      "It was the first serious medical scandal of the internet era and also a sign of things to come.",
      "Internet age and misinformation",
      "Since the birth of social media in the early 2000s, with sites like Friendster and MySpace, there have been growing concerns about the spread of health rumours and misinformation.",
      "Research from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found 20% of parents surveyed in 2023 said they had come across information online that made them worried about vaccines, a sharp jump from just 6% the year before.",
      "As social media sites have gone from niche start-ups to established parts of the media landscape, so the risk of misinformation has changed.",
      "\"Now somebody in one corner of the world can post something and suddenly millions of people in another part of the world can see it within seconds,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"It's not just the speed but the reach of misinformation which puts us in completely uncharted territory.\"",
      "Where young people stand",
      "Research has consistently shown that younger adults are the group most likely to use social media to make decisions about their personal health, and the most vulnerable to misinformation.",
      "Lockdowns and other restrictions also meant many of those in their late teens and twenties lost out on education, on early job opportunities and on full social lives in the pandemic. At the same time they were far less likely than older groups to fall seriously ill after catching the virus.",
      "\"They were the ones who felt like they paid the price for what was primarily an older person's problem,\" says Prof Heidi Larson, a former head of global immunisation communication at UNICEF and the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at LSHTM.",
      "The data suggests younger groups have also seen the biggest falls in vaccine confidence over the last four years, something she says is the \"most concerning\" part of her research.",
      "The proportion of 18-24-year-olds, for example, who say that vaccines are safe and effective has fallen to under 60% in 2023 from 80% in 2019.",
      "\"They should really be the priority, because these are potential young parents and if they are questioning the importance of vaccines, then we are in trouble,\" says Prof Larson, who is giving expert evidence to the Covid inquiry this week.",
      "\"We have to recognise that this is about the whole experience of Covid, and all the controls and pressures. It's like, 'Enough of being told what to do, I just don't want your vaccines anymore'.\"",
      "Speed and safety concerns",
      "The speed at which new Covid vaccines had to be developed has also been at the centre of some of the rumour, concern and distrust there is online.",
      "The data now shows the jabs did their main job \u2013 helping our bodies clear the virus and cutting the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death.",
      "In early clinical trials though the vaccines were also said to be effective \u2013 90% so in the case of the Pfizer jab \u2013 at preventing Covid in the first place. In real world use, that protection against infection and transmission faded within months, as immunity \"waned \" and the virus mutated into different variants.",
      "Crucially though protection against severe disease has proved far more long-lasting.",
      "Then there were safety concerns.",
      "The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were linked to a rare, but serious, blood clot in the brain and their use was restricted to certain groups.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna jabs, meanwhile, have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation, which usually clear up without long-term damage.",
      "The reality is every vaccine, like any medical treatment, always carries a small level of risk, some more than others.",
      "\"The science and public health perspective is quite clear: not only were Covid vaccines safe and effective, but we would have been in a very different world if they hadn't been rolled out so quickly,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"[But] we're in this complicated, murky world with public attitudes where some people thought they weren't what was promised.\"",
      "Vaccine fatigue and 'complacency'",
      "Many people in the UK no longer have direct experience of how dangerous viruses such as measles can be.",
      "The UKHSA says it's been seriously concerned for some time about falling childhood vaccination rates.",
      "The organisation's director of public health programmes, Dr Mary Ramsay, believes that trend, which started in the decade before Covid, is more likely to be driven by complacency than a drop in confidence in the childhood vaccination programme.",
      "Modern lives are also busy and finding time to take a child to a GP for a series of jabs is not always straightforward, she suggests.",
      "In 2024 the number of children receiving a first dose of the MMR vaccine fell to 88.9% in England, the lowest level for 14 years and over the last year we've seen significant measles outbreaks in London, Birmingham and Bristol.",
      "A high level of measles vaccination is vital as it prevents transmission of the virus and protects not just those who receive the jab, but those who can't \u2013 young babies and children with weakened immune systems, for example.",
      "Dr Wall, now clinical director of population health in Greater Manchester, also thinks there might be an element of \"vaccine fatigue\" creeping in since the pandemic, with even some NHS staff left \"tired, jaded and fed-up\" after years of vaccines, boosters, rules and restrictions.",
      "Figures from NHS England, for example, show the number of frontline healthcare workers getting their flu vaccine fell to 35% in November 2024 from 62% in the same month in 2019.",
      "In late 2021, the government brought in a policy of mandatory Covid vaccines for care home staff in England, and later tried to extend that to NHS workers. At times the public were also told they needed Covid jabs (or a recent negative test) to travel abroad, to enter nightclubs and to visit cinemas in parts of the UK.",
      "Those kinds of strict health policies might force up vaccination rates in the short-term, argues Prof Larson at LSHTM, but there's a danger we are now starting to pay a \"long term price\".",
      "The worry is if people feel forced or coerced into taking a vaccine at certain times, wider vaccine confidence and uptake may experience a backlash.",
      "Personal liberty versus state control",
      "For 200 years vaccination has been entangled with personal liberty, state control and other political issues. That's increasingly playing out online where the wider debate also takes in global warming, gun control and immigration, for example.",
      "\"It's 'the people' versus the political and financial elites, with medical and scientific experts seen as among those deemed elitist, speaking a different language and entwined with big business and pharma,\" says Prof Larson.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump's controversial pick for US health secretary, Robert Kennedy Jr, has once again put vaccines firmly on the political agenda.",
      "In the past he has repeated the false claim that vaccines cause autism, urged parents not to jab their children, and had to apologise after claiming the number injured by vaccines was \"a holocaust\".",
      "He has denied on several occasions that he is anti-vaccination, instead saying he is \"pro-safety\".",
      "'We need to be more assertive'",
      "Dr Simon Williams at Swansea University now thinks health authorities have to be clearer about the dangers of some infectious diseases, in the face of online misinformation which often exaggerates the small risk of vaccines.",
      "\"Part of the reason tobacco control campaigns have been so effective since the 1980s was because they were so clear about how dangerous smoking is, and I think we can learn from that,\" he says.",
      "\"We need to be far more assertive about the potential risks of not getting vaccinated.\"",

      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "Another idea is \"pre-bunking\" - that is teaching people to expect and recognise misinformation online before they encounter it in real life, instead of relying on fact-checking and dull public health videos after the event.",
      "Prof Heidi Larson also thinks now is the time to target and better engage with those most at-risk of rejecting vaccines - in particular the younger groups that her data shows are most affected.",
      "\"I would start in schools, I would start in science classes, I think we are losing the plot if we only focus on disinformation, and don't start to build an appreciation of how vaccines work and their benefits,\" she says.",

      "Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as having a BMI over 30 - a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight.",
      "How is BMI calculated?",
      "It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.",
      "For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in):",

      "But BMI has limitations.",
      "It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat.",
      "So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat.",
      "The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese.",
      "But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs.",
      "Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says.",
      "\"Obesity is a health risk - the difference is it's also an illness for some,\" Prof Rubino said.",
      "What are the two groups?",
      "Clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a disease, there will be signs of it affecting organs in the body - through heart disease, breathlessness, type 2 diabetes or joint pain - and a person's day-to-day activities. Treatment with drugs or surgery is likely.",
      "Pre-clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a risk to health - but not yet causing any illnesses, people should be offered weight-loss advice, counselling and monitoring, to reduce the chances of health problems developing.",
      "Doctors should also pay close attention to a patient's family history to see if they are at risk of particular diseases.",
      "At a time when drugs that reduce body weight by up to 20% are being prescribed on a large scale, the report says redefining obesity \"is all the more relevant\" because it \"improves the accuracy of diagnosis\".",
      "Access to weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro is often restricted to patients with a BMI over 30 and a weight-related health condition.",
      "Children's obesity expert Prof Louise Baur, from the University of Sydney, who contributed to the report, said the new approach would allow adults and children with obesity \"to receive more appropriate care\", while reducing the numbers being over-diagnosed and given unnecessary treatment.",
      "The Royal College of Physicians said the report laid a strong foundation \"for treating obesity with the same medical rigour and compassion as other chronic illnesses\".",

    "story": [
      "A public inquiry will be held into the Southport attacks, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced.",
      "It comes after 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to killing three girls - six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice da Silva Aguiar.",
      "Cooper said their families \"needed answers\" about he lead-up to the attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the town last year.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who will address the nation on the case at 08:30 GMT on Tuesday, said there were \"grave questions to answer\" on how the state \"failed\" to protect the three girls.",
      "Describing Rudakubana as \"vile and sick\", Sir Keir said: \"Britain will rightly demand answers, and we will leave no stone unturned in that pursuit.\"",
      "Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time of the attack, had been referred to the Prevent programme three times, Cooper said, between December 2019 and April 2021 when he was aged 13 and 14 years old.",
      "The killer was already known to police, the courts and social services, she said, \"yet between them, those agencies failed to identify the terrible risk and danger to others that he posed\".",
      "Rudakubana admitted 16 charges, including the murder of the three girls on 29 July last year, with not guilty pleas entered on his behalf at a court hearing in December last year.",
      "He also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of eight children and two adults, possession of a knife on the day of the murders, producing a biological toxin, ricin, and the possession of an al-Qaeda training manual - a terror offence.",
      "There has been criticism of the authorities withholding information about Rudakubana's interest in violence and terrorism from the Conservatives and Reform UK.",
      "However, Cooper said lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service had been clear these details \"could not be made public before today to avoid jeopardising the legal proceedings or prejudicing the possible jury trial, in line with the normal rules of the British justice systems\".",
      "Now there has been a guilty plea, Cooper said \"it is essential that the families and the people of Southport can get answers about how this terrible attack could take place and about why this happened to their children\".",
      "She added that during the summer, the Home Office had commissioned an urgent Prevent Learning Review into the three referrals concerning Rudakubana and further details of that review would be published this week, alongside new reforms to the Prevent programme.",
      "Cooper acknowledged \"growing numbers of teenagers\" were being referred to the Prevent scheme, or investigated by counter-terror police or other agencies, due to fears about \"serious violence and extremism\".",

      "\"As Jonathan Hall, Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, has said in the past being open at an early stage is important to maintaining public confidence.\"",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claimed the handling of the Southport case \"one of the worst cover-ups\" he had seen in his lifetime, complaining he had asked questions about whether Rudakubana was known to the authorities but was given \"no answer\" and had instead been \"completely vilified\".",
      "Following the court proceedings, Merseyside Police chief constable Serena Kennedy denied there had been any cover-up.",
      "She said: \"We have been accused of purposely withholding information - this is absolutely not the case.",
      "\"From day one we have been as open as we possibly could and have constantly been in touch with the CPS who have advised us on what information could be released.",
      "\"We have wanted to say much more to show we were being open and transparent, but we have been advised throughout that we couldn't do so as it would risk justice being delivered.\"",
      "\"We will never know why he did it,\" she said, adding: \"What we can say is that from all those documents no one ideology was uncovered, and that is why this was not treated as terrorism.\"",
      "The BBC has been told that before the attack, Rudakubana had been referred to Prevent because of concerns about his general obsession with violence.",
      "In December 2019, Rudakubana - then aged 13 - returned to the school from which he had been expelled and assaulted a pupil with a hockey stick, breaking their wrist.",
      "In the same year he had told NSPCC's Childline he was going to take a knife into school because of racial bullying, which breached their threshold for a referral to local authorities.",
      "Speaking outside court on Monday, Ursula Doyle, the CPS prosecutor, said Rudakubana was \"a young man with a sickening and sustained interest in death and violence - he's shown no signs of remorse\".",
      "Matt Jukes, the head of counterterrorism policing, said a thorough investigation will take place now Rudakubana has pleaded guilty.",
      "\"The same determination we have shown in the investigation will now be applied to examining how the range of agencies involved with Rudakubana did not come together effectively to identify and deal with the risk he posed,\" he said.",
      "Rudakubana is due to be sentenced on Thursday and is expected to be given a life sentence.",
      "However, he cannot be sentenced to a whole-life term for his crimes because he is under the age of 21."

      "Sources point to a weaker Iran, progress towards the ceasefire between Gaza and Israel, and a growing sense that both sides want to bring the Ukraine conflict to an end.

      "And it's not just his late-night online posts causing worry. One of his sells to the American public was to help those trading at home by putting taxes on imports, or tariffs, making it much more expensive for other countries to sell into the States.",
      "But as the IMF warned yesterday, slapping extra tariffs on other countries could hit them hard, and impact the rest of the world's earning power.",
      "In Cabinet there's awareness of how big a departure it would be if Trump goes as far as he has suggested. One minister told me: \"It's a huge moment of history \u2013 American pledging a different way of doing business to what's essentially been in place since the second world war.\"",
      "China and the EU, the other two big trading blocs, would be likely to answer back which could lead to \"huge ramifications of a global trade war\", the minister acknowledges.",
      "Another senior figure warns the UK might struggle to be relevant in a bust up on that scale, saying there'll be an \"arm wrestle between the three \u2013 they won't pay the UK or our interests very much attention\".",
      "As Trump, with the help of Elon Musk, looks to roll back regulation and cut tax, a City insider suggests the UK could fall out of favour because Trump's ambition is to build a very different economy to ours, and that could create a tension of its own.",
      "But another City insider points out that the stock market is \"one of the metrics he cares most about\", and that it is driven by the big tech companies, many of whom depend on selling into China. \"The love affair with the tech bros mean he's not going to want to undermine too much of that,\" they said.",
      "Leader to leader",
      "Whether it's on the economy or Ukraine or any other issue, the relationship between president and prime minister will be absolutely crucial.",
      "Starmer and Trump could hardly be more different. A lawyerly leader known as \"Mr Rules\" versus a man who is a convicted felon and has made a career out of behaving as if rules don't apply to him.",
      "A No 10 source says forget all the noise, and points to the two men meeting in autumn and holding three phone calls since. \"It is the direct conversations that really matter \u2013 whatever Trump's personal style it's clear the substance is there,\" they say, adding that the PM's calm temperament helps.",
      "But others who've dealt with Trump in government, and been on calls with Trump and previous prime ministers, warn how difficult it can be. \"On a good day, fantastic, on a bad day, you'd be crouching,\" one source said.",
      "Another former official who was part of meetings with Trump and Boris Johnson said \"they were like two silverbacks wrestling\", making staff listening in next door cry with laughter. Johnson would \"flatter him obsequiously\" to get what he wanted.",
      "The official was also on calls between Trump and May. These were totally different, with \"more than a whiff of misogyny, he would shout over her\" and talk about the Queen or invite her to play golf, rather than discuss tricky subjects May wanted to raise.",
      "They believe handling Trump will be Sir Keir's biggest challenge: \"We sent him a vicar's daughter, then a pirate who knew how to handle him, now a human rights lawyer,\" they say, adding \"it's not going to work in a world increasingly like the time of 1930s strong men\".",
      "Whatever happens behind closed doors, as America's closest ally, defending Trump's decisions could be incredibly uncomfortable for the prime minister.",
      "A former No 10 official says: \"If Trump says there'll have to be partition in Ukraine, Boris will say awful, others in Labour will say awful, but if Starmer won't sell it in Europe, Trump will take offence and he will punish him.\"",
      "Starmer's allies are more sanguine that \"the politics don't have to match for the relationship to be a success\".",
      "And a success is what they must hope for. It is no secret Labour would have preferred the Democrats and some staff even went to bang on doors for Kamala Harris.",
      "The question for government is how to influence Trump to get what the UK wants, and how to keep its head when the inevitable dramas arrive.",
      "A foreign policy insider told me: \"It might come at a price, but it is in our interest for him to be a success, not be cantankerous.\"",
      "The incoming president is perhaps both an emblem and a product of the changed and uncertain times we live in. As one minister says, \"it's all gone in Trump's direction\".",
      "It is impossible to be sure what Donald Trump, mark two, will do. But after his incredible comeback, and months of nerves on both sides of the Atlantic, we don't have long to wait.",

      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has triggered a row after saying her party wants to explore greater means-testing of government support.",
      "Speaking on LBC Radio, she said the UK had a poor record in prioritising assistance to those who need it the most.",
      "Her comments, in response to a question about the state pension, led other parties to accuse her of wanting to water down the \"triple lock\" uprating policy.",
      "A Tory spokesman denied this was on the cards, accusing Labour and the Liberal Democrats of misrepresenting her.",
      "He added that the party would \"look at means testing\" - but did not specify which benefits would be in scope.",
      "How much is the state pension going up?",
      "Why do politicians keep talking about locks?",
      "During a phone-in on LBC, Badenoch said the UK, like other Western nations, faced a \"structural problem\" because people were living longer while having fewer children.",
      "She added that \"serious thinking\" was required to address the financial impact of more government spending \"on later life\".",
      "Asked whether this included the \"triple lock\" policy - under which state pension payments go up every year by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5% - she replied: \"That's exactly the sort of thing that the policy work we are going to be doing will look at\".",
      "But pressed on whether her party would really look at the \"triple lock\", she then added: \"No, we are going to look at means-testing\".",
      "She went on to add: \"Means-testing is something which we don't do properly here.",
      "\"Starting with the triple lock is not how to solve the problem, we need to start with why are we not making the same kind of money we used to make?\"",
      "'Bungling Badenoch'",
      "However, her comments were seized on by opposition parties to suggest the Tories were planning to shift their stance on the triple lock, which Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats all pledged to continue in last year's general election.",
      "Labour said the Tory leader had \"let the mask slip\" and was preparing to cut the state pension, while the Liberal Democrats said \"bungling Badenoch\" was preparing to make pension cuts \"her first new policy\".",
      "A Tory spokesman denied this, adding the party had \"always protected the triple lock\" and accusing Labour of \"skewing her words for political gain\".",
      "However, the party has yet to clarify which benefits it would consider subjecting to means-testing, when the level of support is linked in some way to a claimant's income or wealth.",
      "Current benefits paid in this way include housing benefit, Universal Credit and pension credit, a top-up paid to poorer pensioners.",
      "Speaking later on Sky News, Tory co-chair Nigel Huddleston did not clarify the party's position either, but said it wanted to look at a \"whole bunch of policy areas\".",
      "It is not the first time Badenoch has been embroiled in a row over comments made during media appearances.",
      "As a Tory leadership candidate last September, she appeared to suggest maternity pay was \"excessive\" before later arguing she was making a more general point about the burden of regulations on business.",
      "'Unsustainable'",
      "Originally a Lib Dem manifesto commitment in the 2010 general election, the state pension triple lock was embraced by the Conservatives when the two parties entered office as a coalition government.",
      "It has since has been in place ever since, save for a temporary suspension during the Covid pandemic, and has also been adopted by Labour.",
      "At the last election, Rishi Sunak pledged to strengthen the uprating policy further by applying it to pensioners' income tax thresholds too.",
      "However some economists have questioned whether the policy is financially sustainable given increasing life expectancy. Others have questioned whether it is fair, given working-age benefits do not increase in the same way.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride has argued the policy is \"unsustainable\" in the \"very, very long term\".",
      "Since taking office Labour has decided to means-test the winter fuel payment, a \u00a3200-\u00a3300 pension supplement that was previously paid to all pensioners, by linking eligibility to pension credit.",
      "Badenoch said she opposed that decision, arguing it would mean pensioners \"on the breadline\" would miss out. She added, however, that she supported the idea it should not go to \"millionaires\".",
      "Writing later on X, Badenoch said the government needed \"better mechanisms\" to target support, instead of using \"proxies\" such as eligibility for pension credit or free school meals."

      "Hannah Finselbach, a senior statistician at the Office for National Statistics, said the drop was driven by a \"very poor month\" for food sales, which in December sank to their lowest level since 2013.",
      "However, it was a \"better month\" for clothing stores and household goods shops, where retailers \"reported strong Christmas trading\", she added.",

    "story": [
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a nationwide review of grooming gang evidence and five government-backed local inquiries.",
      "She stopped short of launching a statutory national inquiry, as called for by the Conservatives and some Labour MPs, but this marks a clear shift in the government's position.",
      "Cooper said top lawyer Tom Crowther, who led an inquiry in Telford, would help Oldham and four other pilot areas yet to be named, develop their own reviews.",
      "She also announced a \"rapid\" three month national audit headed by veteran government trouble-shooter Baroness Louise Casey to examine the demographics of the gangs and their victims, as well as \"cultural drivers\" behind the offending.",
      "Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the plan was \"wholly inadequate\" and repeated his call for a full national inquiry.",
      "He expressed concern that the local inquiries would not have the powers to compel witnesses to attend and give evidence under oath.",
      "The issue had recently been thrust into the spotlight by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has criticised the prime minister for not calling a national inquiry.",
      "Mr Musk responded to Cooper's announcement by saying on his X platform: \"I hope this is a proper investigation\". He added: \"This is a step in the right direction, but the results will speak for themselves.\"",
      "Why some want a new Oldham grooming gang inquiry",
      "Starmer attacks those 'spreading lies' on grooming gangs",
      "The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?",
      "The row between Mr Musk and Starmer centred on high-profile cases where groups of men - mainly of Pakistani descent - were convicted of sexually abusing and raping predominantly young white girls in towns such as Rotherham and Rochdale.",
      "An independent report, published by Prof Alexis Jay in 2014, estimated 1,400 girls had been abused in Rotherham. She would later go on to lead a national review into child sexual abuse, which lasted seven years and made 20 recommendations when it was published in 2022.",
      "In recent days three Labour MPs publicly expressed support for a national inquiry - Dan Carden, Rotherham MP Sarah Champion, and Rochdale MP Paul Waugh.",
      "Other senior Labour figures, including Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, also joined the calls, saying they would support a limited new inquiry.",
      "Prof Jay rejected calls for a new national inquiry last week, saying victims want to see action on her recommendations and a new inquiry would cause delays.",
      "The prime minister and Labour ministers had said their priority was to implement the Jay recommendations, and Cooper announced that one of the key points - mandatory reporting - would be added to the Crime and Policing Bill.",
      "In a statement in the House of Commons, Cooper said that despite Prof Jay's report and other inquiries, \"shamefully little progress had been made\".",
      "\"That has got to change,\" she said and added that by Easter, the government would set out a \"clear timetable\" for implementing the Jay report's recommendations.",
      "Cooper argued that \"effective local inquiries can delve into far more local detail and deliver more locally relevant answers, and change, than a lengthy nationwide inquiry can provide\"",
      "She said Tom Crowther, who led an inquiry in Telford, would help the government develop a new framework for \"victim-centred locally-led inquiries where they are needed\".",
      "She said this would begin by working with Oldham Council and up to four other pilot areas, with \u00a35m of an overall \u00a310m package being put up to \"get work off the ground\".",
      "Champion pressed the home secretary on whether the inquires would be able to summon witnesses to give evidence.",
      "\"What we need to do is make sure there have been no cover-ups, and it's only if it's on a statutory footing that we can do that,\" she said.",
      "Cooper replied that different approaches could be taken and the government would work with local mayors and local councils to \"make sure that we can strengthen the accountability arrangements\".",
      "She said this included introducing a \"duty of candour\" which requires public servants to tell the truth.",
      "The separate audit looking at the ethnicity of grooming gangs and their victims will be led by Baroness Casey, who previously led the 2015 review of Rotherham Council.",
      "The crossbench peer has already been appointed to lead a commission into social care, but Downing Street insisted the two pieces of work would not clash, saying her work on grooming gangs would be finished by the start of April.",
      "In her statement, Cooper also announced she would be asking chief constables in England and Wales to re-examine historic gang exploitation cases and re-open investigations \"were appropriate\". This would be backed by \u00a32.5m of funding, she said.",
      "More victims of child sexual abuse and exploitation will be able to seek an independent review of their cases, the government has said.",
      "'We've been fighting for this'",
      "On the same day Cooper was delivering her statement, BBC News spent time with four survivors of historic sex abuse in Oldham.",
      "They had travelled to Birmingham to meet Jess Phillips, the government minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls.",
      "Listening to Cooper's statement, \"Sarah\" and \"Amelia\" exchanged a hug.",
      "\"We've been fighting for this,\" they said through tears.",
      "After spending time with Phillips, Amelia said: \"I feel like the weight of the world has been lifted off my shoulders. I'm satisfied for now but actions speak louder than words.\"",
      "But survivors \"Sam\" and \"Jane\" were not satisfied and said they did not feel they had been listened to.",
      "\"We want a government inquiry into Oldham and into other towns,\" Sam told the BBC.",
      "\"We know what is right and what is wrong. We know that a government-led inquiry differs from a council-led inquiry.\"",
      "The women expressed their frustration that the government decision for Thursday's announcement was already made before their meeting had taken place.",

      "\"We made it the law that we would deliver net zero carbon emissions by 2050. And only then did we start thinking about how we would do that.",
      "\"We announced that we would lower immigration, but immigration kept going up.",

    "summary": "Gas from the seafloor has scientists wondering if oxygen could be found in the oceans of other planets.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists who recently discovered that metal lumps on the dark seabed make oxygen, have announced plans to study the deepest parts of Earth's oceans in order to understand the strange phenomenon.",
      "Their mission could \"change the way we look at the possibility of life on other planets too,\" the researchers say.",
      "The initial discovery confounded marine scientists. It was previously accepted that oxygen could only be produced in sunlight by plants - in a process called photosynthesis.",
      "If oxygen - a vital component of life - is made in the dark by metal lumps, the researchers believe that process could be happening on other planets, creating oxygen-rich environments where life could thrive.",
      "Lead researcher Prof Andrew Sweetman explained: \"We are already in conversation with experts at Nasa who believe dark oxygen could reshape our understanding of how life might be sustained on other planets without direct sunlight.",
      "\"We want to go out there and figure out what exactly is going on.\"",
      "A dark, controversial discovery",
      "The initial discovery triggered a global scientific row - there was criticism of the findings from some scientists and from deep sea mining companies that plan to harvest the precious metals in the seabed nodules.",
      "If oxygen is produced at these extreme depths, in total darkness, that calls into question what life could survive and thrive on the seafloor, and what impact mining activities could have on that marine life.",
      "That means that seabed mining companies and environmental organisations - some of which claimed that the findings provided evidence that seafloor mining plans should be halted - will be watching this new investigation closely.",
      "The plan is to work at sites where the seabed is more than 10km (6.2 miles) deep, using remotely operated submersible equipment.",
      "\"We have instruments that can go to the deepest parts of the ocean,\" explained Prof Sweetman. \"We're pretty confident we'll find it happening elsewhere, so we'll start probing what's causing it.\"",
      "Some of those experiments, in collaboration with scientists at Nasa, will aim to understand whether the same process could allow microscopic life to thrive beneath oceans that are on other planets and moons.",
      "\"If there's oxygen,\" said Prof Sweetman, \"there could be microbial life taking advantage of that.\"",
      "To mine or not to mine",
      "The initial, biologically baffling findings were published last year in the journal Nature Geoscience. They came from several expeditions to an area of the deep sea between Hawaii and Mexico, where Prof Sweetman and his colleagues sent sensors to the seabed - at about 5km (3.1 miles) depth.",
      "That area is part of a vast swathe of seafloor that is covered with the naturally occurring metal nodules, which form when dissolved metals in seawater collect on fragments of shell - or other debris. It's a process that takes millions of years.",
      "Sensors that the team deployed repeatedly showed oxygen levels going up.",
      "\"I just ignored it, Prof Sweetman told BBC News at the time, \"because I'd been taught that you only get oxygen through photosynthesis\".",
      "Eventually, he and his colleagues stopped ignoring their readings and set out instead to understand what was going on. Experiments in their lab - with nodules that the team collected submerged in beakers of seawater - led the scientists to conclude that the metallic lumps were making oxygen out of seawater. The nodules, they found, generated electric currents that could split (or electrolyse) molecules of seawater into hydrogen and oxygen.",
      "Then came the backlash, in the form of rebuttals - posted online - from scientists and from seabed mining companies.",
      "One of the critics, Michael Clarke from the Metals Company, a Canadian deep sea mining company, told BBC News that the criticism was focused on a \"lack of scientific rigour in the experimental design and data collection\". Basically, he and other critics claimed there was no oxygen production - just bubbles that the equipment produced during sample collection.",
      "\"We've ruled out that possibility,\" Prof Sweetman responded. \"But these [new] experiments will provide the proof.\"",
      "This might seem a niche, technical argument, but several multi-billion pound mining companies are already exploring the possibility of harvesting tonnes of these metals from the seafloor.",
      "The natural deposits they are targeting contain metals vital for making batteries, and demand for those metals is increasing rapidly as many economies move from fossil fuels to, for example, electric vehicles.",
      "The race to extract those resources has caused concern among environmental groups and researchers. More than 900 marine scientists from 44 countries have signed a petition\u00a0highlighting the environmental risks and calling for a pause on mining activity.",
      "Talking about his team's latest research mission at a press conference on Friday, Prof Sweetman said: \"Before we do anything, we need to - as best as possible - understand the [deep sea] ecosystem.",
      "\"I think the right decision is to hold off before we decide if this is the right thing to do as a a global society.\""

    "story": [
      "After lying hidden beneath metres of volcanic rock and ash for 2,000 years, a \"once-in-a-century\" find has been unearthed in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in Italy.",
      "Archaeologists have discovered a sumptuous private bathhouse - potentially the largest ever found there - complete with hot, warm and cold rooms, exquisite artwork, and a huge plunge pool.",
      "The spa-like complex sits at the heart of a grand residence uncovered over the last two years during a major excavation.",
      "\"It's these spaces that really are part of the 'Pompeii effect' - it's almost as if the people had only left a minute ago,\" says Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, who has revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "Analysis of two skeletons discovered in the house also shows the horror faced by Pompeii's inhabitants when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79.",
      "The bodies belonged to a woman, aged between 35 and 50, who was clutching jewellery and coins, and a younger man in his teens or early 20s.",
      "They had barricaded themselves into a small room, but were killed as a tsunami of superheated volcanic gas and ash - known as a pyroclastic flow - ripped through the town.",
      "\"This is a dramatic place, and everything you find here tells you about the drama,\" says Pompeii conservator, Dr Ludovica Alesse.",
      "A third of the ancient city still lies hidden beneath volcanic debris from the disaster, but the new excavation - the most extensive in a generation - provides new insights into ancient Roman life.",
      "The archaeologists have been followed by a documentary team from the BBC and Lion TV, for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig.",
      "An entire block of Pompeii has now been uncovered, revealing a laundry and bakery, as well as the large private house. It's thought these were all owned by one wealthy individual, possibly Aulus Rustius Verus, an influential Pompeii politician.",
      "The discovery of the bathhouse is further confirmation of his elite status, says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "\"There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy,\" he says. \"And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.\"",
      "Those lucky enough to use the suite of bathing rooms would have undressed in a changing room with vibrant red walls and a mosaic floor dotted with geometric patterns inlaid with marble from across the Roman Empire.",
      "They would then head to the hot room, taking a dip in a bath and enjoying the sauna-like warmth, provided by a suspended floor that allowed hot air to flow underneath and walls with a cavity where the heat could circulate.",
      "Next they would move to the brightly-painted warm room, where oil would be rubbed into the skin, before being scraped off with a curved instrument called a strigil.",
      "Finally, they would enter the largest and most spectacular room of all - the frigidarium, or cold room. Surrounded by red columns and frescoes of athletes, a visitor could cool off in the plunge pool, which is so large 20-30 people could fit in it.",
      "\"In the hot summers, you could sit with your feet in the water, chatting with your friends, maybe enjoying a cup of wine,\" says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "The bathhouse is the latest find to emerge from this extraordinary house.",
      "A huge banqueting room with jet black walls and breathtaking artwork of classical scenes was found last year. A smaller, more intimate room - painted in pale blue - where residents of the house would go and pray to the gods was also unearthed.",
      "The residence was mid-renovation - tools and building materials have been found throughout. In the blue room a pile of oyster shells lie on the floor, ready to be ground up and applied to the walls to give them an iridescent shimmer.",
      "Next door to this beautiful space, in a cramped room with barely any decoration, a stark discovery was made - the remains of two Pompeiians who failed to escape from the eruption.",
      "The skeleton of a woman was found lying on top of a bed, curled up in a foetal position. The body of a man was in the corner of this small room.",
      "\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" explains Dr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii.",
      "\"The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"",
      "Analysis of the male skeleton showed that despite his young age, his bones had signs of wear and tear, suggesting he was of lower status, possibly even a slave.",
      "The woman was older, but her bones and teeth were in good condition.",
      "\"She was probably someone higher up in society,\" says Dr Hay. \"She could have been the wife of the owner of the house - or maybe an assistant looking after the wife, we just don't know.\"",
      "An assortment of items were found on a marble table top in the room - glassware, bronze jugs and pottery - perhaps brought into the room where the pair had tucked themselves away hoping to wait out the eruption.",
      "But it's the items clutched by the victims that are of particular interest. The younger man held some keys, while the older woman was found with gold and silver coins and jewellery.",
      "These are kept in Pompeii's vault, along with the city's other priceless finds, and we were given a chance to see them with archaeologist, Dr Alessandro Russo.",
      "The gold coins still gleam as if they were new, and he shows us delicate gold and natural pearl earrings, necklace pendants and intricately etched semi-precious stones.",
      "\"When we find this kind of object, the distance from ancient times and modern times disappears,\" Dr Russo says, \"and we can touch a small piece of the life of these people who died in the eruption.\"",
      "Dr Sophie Hay describes the private bathhouse complex as a once-in-a-century discovery, which also sheds more light on a darker side of Roman life.",
      "Just behind the hot room is a boiler room. A pipe brought water in from the street - with some syphoned off into the cold plunge pool - and the rest was heated in a lead boiler destined for the hot room. The valves that regulated the flow look so modern it's as if you could turn them on and off even today.",
      "With a furnace sitting beneath, the conditions in this room would have been unbearably hot for the slaves who had to keep the whole system going.",
      "\"The most powerful thing from these excavations is that stark contrast between the lives of the slaves and the very, very rich. And here we see it,\" says Dr Sophie Hay.",
      "\"The difference between the sumptuous life of the bathhouse, compared to the furnace room, where the slaves would be feeding the fire toiling all day.",
      "\"A wall is all that could divide you between two different worlds.\"",
      "The excavation is in its final weeks - but new discoveries continue to emerge from the ash. Limited numbers of visitors are allowed to visit the dig while it's ongoing, but eventually it will be fully opened to the public.",
      "\"Every day here is a surprise,\" says Dr Anna Onesti, director of the excavation.",
      "\"Sometimes in the morning I come to work thinking that it's a normal working day - and then I discover we found something exceptional.",
      "\"It's a magic moment for the life of Pompeii, and this excavation work offers us the possibility to share this with the public.\"",

    "title": "Nepal's leader says it has too many tigers. Does it?",
    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 23:05:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Wild tigers killed nearly 40 people in Nepal between 2019 and 2023. Solutions are hard to come by.",
    "story": [
      "Nepal has been celebrated globally for tripling its tiger population in a decade - but Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli thinks the country may have been too successful.",
      "\"In such a small country, we have more than 350 tigers\u2026 We can't have so many tigers and let them eat up humans,\" he said last month at an event organised to review the country's COP29 outcomes.",
      "Attacks by tigers claimed nearly 40 lives and injured 15 people between 2019 and 2023, according to government data. But local communities say the figure is much higher.",
      "\"For us, 150 tigers are enough,\" Oli declared in December, even suggesting that Nepal could send its prized big cats to other countries as gifts.",
      "How many tigers are too many?",
      "There is no one answer, experts say. It depends on the availability of prey in a given area -  ideally, each tiger should be in the vicinity of about 500 prey animals, such as deer, antelopes or wild buffalo, tiger biologist Ullas Karanth says.",
      "Experts argue that Oli's concern with capping tiger numbers is misplaced. Rather, Nepal's government should focus on \"expanding protected areas that have reasonable natural densities of prey and tigers,\" Dr Karanth adds.",
      "If wildlife is spilling out of protected areas in search of prey, that might explain why so many attacks have happened in places that border forests, where tigers have always encountered humans.",
      "An example is the \"buffer zones\" that lie between national parks and human settlements. Wildlife sightings are common here, but locals also use the area for cattle-grazing and collecting fodder and firewood.",
      "Forest corridors - strips of land that connect different parks and bio-reserves allowing wildlife to roam between them - have emerged as yet another flashpoint. Roads sometimes run through these areas, and locals also use them for foraging, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.",
      "The rise in human fatalities is a sign that Nepal's once-successful conservation model is cracking, zoologist Karan Shah says.",
      "\"So far, [Nepal's] focus seems to be on winning international attention, while ignoring the impact on communities living around national parks and protected areas,\" Mr Shah adds.",
      "He argues that conservation is not just \"an ecological or scientific issue\" but also a social one - and that the loss of human lives must be prevented so local communities remain a part of the conservation effort and don't turn against it. Anger among locals has also been growing as tigers have been preying on livestock.",
      "\"A significant portion of our population still live in rural areas and are dependent on forest resources that they help conserve - but they are now increasingly being killed and injured by tigers,\" Thakur Bhandari, president of Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal, told the BBC.",
      "\"As forest conservationists we cannot be against wildlife, but that does not mean we should ignore its impact on humans and our society.\"",
      "A success story turned deadly",
      "A century ago, some 100,000 tigers roamed Asia - but deforestation and rampant poaching pushed them to the brink of extinction. There are now only about 5,600 wild tigers remaining across 13 countries, including Nepal, China, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia.",
      "All of these nations had committed to doubling their tiger numbers by 2022, but Nepal was the first to surpass the target - due in part to a zero-poaching initiative and a doubling of the country's forest cover between 1992 and 2016.",
      "Connecting 16 protected zones in southern Nepal with areas across the border in northern India created forest corridors which helped too.",
      "The growing number of tiger attacks has now tarnished that achievement.",
      "Oli believes Nepal's tiger population is growing at the cost of human lives. Viable solutions, however, are not easy to come by.",
      "The parks and wildlife department has acknowledged the challenge of managing tigers in Nepal, where those that kill humans are tracked down and taken into captivity.",
      "\"Zoos and rescue centres are already overwhelmed with problematic tigers,\" the department said in a conservation report published in 2023. \"A comprehensive protocol is urgently needed to cope with the rescue, handling, and rehabilitation of problem animals.\"",
      "Oli has proposed sending Nepal's tigers abroad.",
      "\"People love to keep birds like falcons and peacocks as pets, so why not tigers?\" he suggested. \"That would boost their status too.\"",
      "Others have different ideas.",
      "Dr Karanth says tigers that have repeatedly taken human lives should be \"killed immediately\". Some argue that humans exacerbated the problem by encroaching into the tigers' natural habitats, using the land for cultivation or infrastructure and reducing the big cats' prey-base.",
      "The BBC spoke to a wildlife management expert, meanwhile, who claims Oli wants to bring down tiger numbers so that more land can be cleared to build infrastructure.",
      "\"It is not about people's safety,\" he said.",
      "For now the situation is at an impasse. It's unclear whether Oli's \"tiger diplomacy\" suggestion will gain traction, or whether over-encroaching humans or tigers are to blame for Nepal's tiger attack crisis.",
      "What is clear is that humans and tigers are struggling to achieve peaceful co-existence in Nepal - and the country's conservation success story has brought many of its own thorny problems to reckon with.",
      "Tigers are back from the brink and attacks are increasing",

    "summary": "DNA analysis suggests Iron Age societies in Britain were built around women rather than men.",
    "story": [
      "Women in Britain 2,000 years ago appear to have passed on land and wealth to daughters not sons as communities were built around women's blood lines, according to new research.",
      "Skeletons unearthed in Dorset contained DNA evidence that Celtic men moved to live with their wives' families and communities.",
      "Scientists found evidence of a whole community built around the female line of a family over generations, probably originating with one woman.",
      "\"This points to an Iron Age society in Britain where women wielded quite a lot of influence and could shape its trajectory in many ways,\" says Dr Lara Cassidy at Trinity College, Dublin, lead author of the research.",
      "It is the first time this evidence of communities being built around women has been documented in ancient European history.",
      "The scientists believe that the communities also invested a lot in their daughters as they would probably inherit their mother's status.",
      "\"It's relatively rare in modern societies, but this might not always have been the case,\" says Dr Cassidy.",
      "The team found evidence that it happened in numerous places in Britain, suggesting it was widespread.",
      "The communities analysed lived around the same time as Boudica, the warrior Queen who led a rebellion against Roman invaders in East Anglia around AD 61.",
      "Dr Cassidy sequenced DNA taken from the bones of 57 individuals from a tribe called the Durotriges. The people lived in Winterborne Kingston, Dorset around 100 BC to AD 100.",
      "The skeletons were dug up from a cemetery by a team of archaeologists at Bournemouth University.",
      "By tracing mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed on by women, Dr Cassidy found that most women in the community were related by blood dating back generations.",
      "By contrast, there was a lot of diversity in the Y chromosomes, which is passed from father to son, indicating that men from lots of different families married into the community.",
      "The DNA analysis also indicates that most of the ancestral line could be traced back to a single woman.",
      "The work indicates that this society was what is known as matrilocal - meaning that a married man moved to live in his wife's community.",
      "\"The most sort of obvious benefit to a woman is that if you don't leave home, you don't leave your support network. Your parents, siblings, family members are all still around you,\" says Dr Cassidy.",
      "\"It's your husband who's coming in, he's the relative stranger to the community, and he's dependent on your family for his livelihood and land,\" she adds.",
      "The researchers found the same matrilocality evidence in bones from other cemeteries including in Cornwall and Yorkshire.",
      "She says that evidence of powerful women in ancient communities has often been dismissed an a one-off, not the norm, but these findings challenge that thinking.",
      "Archaeologists Prof Miles Russell and Prof Martin Smith found other evidence that women had high status.",
      "\"We find quite elaborately furnished graves with high status objects of wealth. Every time we find that, it occurs in women's graves, so we think wealth was being transferred down the female line,\" says Prof Martin Smith at Bournemouth university.",
      "The findings also back up Roman writings at the time which suggested that women in Britain were quite powerful, more so than in Rome.",
      "But Romans like Julius Caeser viewed that as a sign of backwardness.",
      "\"Women in Britain had power and it was a more egalitarian place. That was the biggest problem that Romans had with the Britons because Rome was a deeply patriarchal society. To them, it marked Britons as the ultimate Barbarians,\" says Professor Miles Russell at Bournemouth University.",
      "The majority of societies today are patrilocal, meaning women move to their husband's communities.",
      "But some matrilocal communities exist today or in the recent past, including the Akans in Ghana, West Africa and Cherokee in North America.",
      "The scientists say that Iron Age Britain may have been matrilocal because men were frequently away fighting.",

      "Matrilocal societies are also less likely to experience internal conflict, she says.",

      "The second time, it said there had been a glitch while trying to bring the satellites closer, but added that the spacecraft were safe.",
      "On Sunday, Isro said scientists had managed to reduce the distance between the Chaser and the Target first to 15metres and then to 3metres. They said after the trial attempt, the spacecraft were \"moved back to safe distance\" and that they were analysing data.",
      "S Somanath, who was Isro chief when SpaDeX (short for Space Docking Experiment) was launched and was monitoring its progress until his retirement a few days ago, had described docking as \"a very complex process\" that needed extreme precision and coordination.",
      "To begin with, the two spacecraft had to be in the same orbit so that the Chaser could start to approach the Target.",
      "On Thursday morning, scientists began by gradually reducing the speed of the two spacecraft - bringing them ever closer until they were just 3 metres apart. Then their connectors were latched together.",
      "In the next step, the two spacecraft were screwed on perfectly, creating an airtight passage for safe transfer of material or crew, completing space docking.",
      "An Isro official told the BBC that over the next two-three days, the mission will carry out what is being billed as one of its most important experiments - it will transfer electrical power from the Chaser to Target.",
      "This, Ms Mitra, says is to demonstrate that a spacecraft can be sent to service another in space.",
      "The experiment will then demonstrate \"undocking and separation of the two satellites\".",
      "Ms Mitra says the mission will also test India's capabilities for inter-satellite communication as during the docking and undocking, the spacecraft will have to communicate with the Earth station and also with each other so that they know each other's position and velocity.",
      "The spacecraft are also carrying scientific instruments and cameras which will then be deployed. Over the next two years, they will measure radiation in space and monitor natural resources on Earth.",
      "Isro, known for economising its missions, is also using a part of the rocket that carried SpaDeX to space - which in normal circumstances would become space debris - to conduct some important experiments in orbit for three months.",

    "title": "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 02:08:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK led the way in this field of science until recently - but now other countries have overtaken. So, how can that lead be recovered?",
    "story": [

      "Listen to Pallab read this story",
      "In a gleaming laboratory in Edinburgh, robotic machines whirr and mix. The final product that they are creating will be a pine-smelling chemical that can be used as an ingredient in perfumes. But the starting point is very different: a brown, gloopy, fat mixture, recently fished out from below ground - fatbergs.",
      "Fatbergs are the foul phenomenon found lurking in (and blocking up) sewers. The development of the technology used to perform this apparent alchemy is being described by some as a new industrial revolution.",
      "This is the fast-moving field of bioengineering. The good news is that Britain is currently strong in the science compared with other countries.",
      "It is potentially great news for the environment too because it can recycle waste and make things more sustainably. Plus the government is keen because it may mean new industries and new jobs.",
      "But the British lead has slipped away recently because of a lack of investment, poor regulation and the wrong policies. The question now is, can it be recovered?",
      "And if it can, at what cost? Because some experts are concerned that certain potential risks are being overlooked amid the enthusiasm to reap the benefits - and to win back the lead.",
      "A crazy idea 'that works'",
      "Prof Stephen Wallace from the University of Edinburgh is among those turning the fatbergs into perfumes. \"It's a crazy idea,\" he admits to me, \"but it works.\"",
      "Fatbergs are accumulated lumps of fat from cooking oils, toilet and other food waste that people put down their drains. Prof Wallace gets his from a company that specialises in fishing them out of sewers and turning them into biofuels. They arrive at the lab in a tube.",
      "The first step is to sterilise the material in a steamer. Prof Wallace then adds the specially modified bacteria to the remnants of the fatberg. The bacteria have a short section of DNA inserted, to give the bacteria their particular properties.",
      "The fatberg gradually disappears, as the bacteria eat it, producing the chemical with the pine-like smell - this can be used as an ingredient in perfumes.",
      "Prof Wallace says that while the UK has taken a lead role in establishing the technology, it now needs to show it can go to the next step. \"We are at this nervous point where the core technology that enables a huge range of sustainable industrial technologies is established and we are now progressing to the stage of scaling up to manufacturing.",
      "\"But there is a challenge in the UK to create infrastructure... and progress to commercialisation at a rate that is comparable to investment in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Tech advances at break-neck speed",
      "If the UK can scale up, the appetite for investment appears to be there. Prof Wallace is working with two perfume companies that are interested in the process because it is more sustainable than the method they currently use, which involves making the fragrance from chemicals extracted from fossil fuels.",
      "But while the basic technology exists, it is advancing at break-neck speed, meaning the UK's leading role is insecure.",
      "One of Stephen's colleagues, Dr Joanna Sadler, has created microbes that turn used plastic, that would otherwise damage the environment, into vanilla essence and other useful and expensive chemicals.",
      "\"Since I first published the work four or five years ago, the field has absolutely exploded, not just in the UK but across the world,\" she tells me. \"It's an extremely fast-moving field.\"",
      "One member of the University of Edinburgh's hub has created bugs that extract important metals from burnt-out batteries, which would otherwise leak noxious chemicals into landfill. Another is turning waste water from whisky distillation into a plant-based alternative to fish-oil health supplements.",
      "The possibilities are endless, and innovation has accelerated because of the development of cheap and accurate ways of manipulating DNA. It means it is now much easier to harness and adapt the power of nature to create all sorts of things.",
      "However all those possibilities require funding.",
      "A national priority?",
      "The technology was set as a national priority by the previous government in December 2023 with the publication of a policy document called the National Vision for Engineering Biology and an allocation of \u00a32bn over 10 years. The Labour government has indicated that it too regards it as a priority but has made no firm spending commitment.",
      "On the face of it, engineering biology could help Labour achieve two of its five big priorities in government: growth and sustainability. But at present the funding remains uncertain.",
      "The chief scientific advisor Prof Angela McLean, whom the Prime Minister turns to for matters scientific, has been looking into this.",
      "\"We are looking for products like this handbag,\" Prof McLean explained, while stroking a faux leather handbag made by one of the many new start-up engineering biology companies spinning out of university research.",
      "Modern Synthesis based south London made the bag from material grown from a non-genetically engineered microbe.",
      "\"They will be much less polluting, much more sustainable than their current equivalents, as well as generate great jobs, good environment and prosperity,\" she continues.",
      "\"Engineering biology is something the UK is really good at and the world is going to need. It is in its infancy and we need to keep on investing in it as a country.\"",
      "Losing out to Korea and the US",
      "In the 20th Century, the UK led the way in the basic sciences of electronics, computing and the biosciences. But, with some notable exceptions, scientific excellence in these sectors was not translated into truly large world-leading businesses.",
      "In all these cases, there was initial government enthusiasm and funding, but no follow-through. That meant that the science and ideas were bought up by mostly US companies, generating wealth and jobs overseas.",
      "The fear that the UK is losing its way is highlighted in a new House of Lords report, which was out on the 14 January, that says that engineering biology risks going down the same path for exactly the same reasons.",
      "It states that \"other countries are beginning to overtake the UK, and we are at severe risk of losing the prospective benefits of a world-leading engineering biology sector\".",
      "How Biden tarnished his own legacy",
      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "The report also says that there is a \"small but closing window\" to make some small policy tweaks that could make a huge difference, such as recommitting to the target set out in the National Vision for at least \u00a32 billion of funding over the next decade.",
      "Professor Susan Rosser, co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, told the Lords Science and Technology committee, which produced the report, \"we were ahead of the game, but we have lost that leadership because of substantial investments in the US and Korea\".",
      "She said: \"We are losing trained people overseas. People from Edinburgh have moved to Singapore, the States, Germany and Austria.",
      "\"If this is genuinely going to be a key part of our economy, we need the skill set trained, and as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brain drain",
      "Dr Carolina Grandellis, a biofoundry manager at the Earlham Institute research park in Norwich, added that it was hard to replenish the brain drain by attracting scientists from overseas because of a tightening of the visa system by both the previous and current government.",
      "\"The government intends to increase restrictions on legal skilled migration. That will have a cost for our field.\"",
      "According to Baroness Brown of Cambridge, who chairs the Lords committee, the heart of the problem is that there is no clear plan to increase the number of skilled scientists or to have the right policies and regulations in place to enable engineering biology to flourish in the UK.",
      "\"All too often we hear that when companies reach a certain size, they move abroad for better investment and development prospects, taking most of the economic benefit with them,\" she says. \"This requires urgent action\".",
      "Another issue is that the UK biofoundries, like the one at Edinburgh University, are not properly funded, according to Prof Paul Freemont, who is a co-director of a biofoundry at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"The scale of investment in biofoundries internationally is enormous. In Korea, it just announced $100m (\u00a382m) for a K-Biofoundry. In Shenzhen in China, about $750m (\u00a3614m) has gone into a building in which each floor [studies] an organism.",
      "\"Our biofoundry in London had \u00a37m of public investment in infrastructure and we have had no funding for staff. We are constantly scrabbling for cash\".",
      "Not all funding can come from government. But the Lords' report found that enough private investment was not forthcoming either. Unlike in the US, UK investors expect returns in a few years, rather than the tens of years that innovative companies need for their ideas to really start making money.",
      "'Living pollution' that could spread",
      "A further barrier for the field is its regulation by government, especially for applications for producing novel foods, according to Will Milligan CEO of Extracellular, which provides products to firms making lab-grown meat.",
      "\"Singapore, on the other hand, has a very clear framework for the approval process in bringing products to market, and the recommended timelines are about half what they are in the UK.\"",
      "In response to criticisms, the government has set up a body to cut through the red tape, the Regulatory Innovation Office.",
      "But \"streamlining does mean deregulation, in many circumstances\", argues Dr Helen Wallace, director of the campaign group Gene Watch. She worries that the risks of engineering biology are being overlooked by the government in its enthusiasm to reap the claimed benefits.",
      "Many applications of the technology involve creating entirely new organisms which are contained inside large vats in the production process. Even if they were to escape, they are unlikely to survive as they have been engineered to thrive in the very specific, artificial conditions they were designed for.",
      "But Dr Wallace is concerned about some applications that are designed to be released into the environment. \"There is one in the US which is made to survive and reproduce in the soil to boost nitrogen levels, which is very worrying because even very small changes in their DNA could make them more harmful to people, animals and plants.",
      "\"This could create a new kind of living pollution that could spread in rivers, the sea, the air, in rain and you would not be able to reverse any adverse consequences\".",
      "Inadvertent creation of superbugs",
      "Scientists and industrialists agree that without public trust, this shining new industry is going nowhere. And to win trust, the advocates of engineering biology must be open and honest about the risks.",
      "Most worrisome is the inadvertent creation of superbugs that could spread disease or create environmental problems by disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.",
      "A group of 38 leading scientists recently expressed concern about the creation of \"mirror life\", which would be artificially created organisms whose DNA is the mirror image of their naturally occurring counterparts.",
      "Writing in the journal Science, they said that these mirror organisms could pose serious risks and rip through the immune systems of plants and animals. The scientists have called for a moratorium on their creation until more is known about them and what steps can be taken to minimise risks.",
      "But the problem is that the technology has become so cheap and widely available that such a moratorium would be hard to police. And while the creation of mirror life is a highly specialised skill, bad actors could make simpler changes, increasing the risk of bioterrorism.",
      "Government and manufacturers think that there are considerable environmental and economic benefits to this technology. But if the public won't accept it, there's no point to all this increased investment: it won't be used; no one will buy the products. And there are real risks: scientists and campaigners want the public to be fully informed, in an open and transparent way.",
      "Prof Freemont admits that in their enthusiasm for the good that engineering biology can bring. \"We've taken our eye off the ball a little bit in engaging with the public.",
      "\"The sector needs to ensure that the general consumer and citizen can begin to understand this technology\".",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 04:34:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Pigs, donkeys and even a mini cow named Cuddles found a temporary home after the LA fires.",
    "story": [
      "The trailers arrived all at once, carrying hundreds of horses fleeing the Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles.",
      "Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed.",
      "Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters.",
      "The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.",
      "Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies.",
      "Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened.",
      "A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from the Eaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped.",
      "His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air.",
      "One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured.",
      "\"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\"",
      "Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables.",
      "Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities.",
      "Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides.",
      "\"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\"",
      "But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.",
      "So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy.",
      "Watching owners reunite with their horses was one of the most valuable experiences for volunteers, said London Scott, founder of the local Cali Cowboy Club.",
      "\"It's a really beautiful process to go through,\" Ms Scott said, \"To be able to see that at first hand, and know that you had a small part in someone having a little peace of mind in a tragic moment in time.\"",
      "Those here describe a deep bond to their animals and say the farms that burned down are a place of peace in this bustling metropolitan area.",
      "\"They are my safe place,\" Catherine Armenta, 42, said. \"It's like a bond, a connection that I don't really have with anything else on this planet.\"",
      "Many of those here don't know what happens next, where they might take their animals after the chaos of the ongoing fires burning around the Los Angeles region ends.",
      "\"I haven't been able to even process any of this. There's 40 horses to take care of,\" Ms Bacon said. \"When everything is said and done, I think we're all gonna go get margaritas and just have a good cry.\""

      "Mr Masson welcomed its pledge to improve wi-fi infrastructure around EV charging points.",

      "A BT Group spokesperson said the trial tested \"a great deal about the challenges that many on-street EV drivers are facing with charging and where BT Group can add most value to the UK EV ecosystem.\"",
      "They added: \"Other emerging needs we've identified include the wi-fi connectivity challenge surrounding EV's - our pilots will now shift in focus to explore this further.\"",

      "The speech was a mix of promises \u2013 and contradictions \u2013 that underlined some of the opportunities and challenges the new president will face in his second term in office.",

      "That last line generated an enthusiastic response at the Capitol and wild cheers from his crowd of supporters gathered at a nearby sport arena. It's a sign that cultural issues - where he drew the most vivid contrasts with Democrats in last year's election - will continue to be one of Trump's most powerful ways the new president connects with his base.",

      "LIVE - latest updates and analysis",
      "As his predecessor, Joe Biden, and other Democrats sat stone-faced to one side, Trump said the government faces a \"crisis of trust\". He condemned the \"vicious, violent and unfair weaponisation\" of the US Justice Department, which had investigated and attempted to prosecute him for contesting the 2020 election results.",
      "He claimed a mandate to reverse \"horrible betrayals\" and lashed out at a \"radical and corrupt establishment\" that he said extracted power and wealth from America's citizens.",
      "It was the kind of populist, anti-elite rhetoric that has been a staple of Trump's speeches for a decade. Unlike when Trump first began his ascent to the pinnacles of US political power in 2015, however, Trump represents the current emerging establishment as much as any one man. And sitting behind him on the dais were a collection of some of the wealthiest, and most influential, corporate leaders in the world.",
      "On the day of his inauguration, Trump has the attention \u2013 and the initiative. His aides have promised hundreds of executive actions \u2013 on a range of subjects, including immigration, energy, trade, education and hot-button cultural issues.",
      "In his inaugural address, he detailed a handful of them. He pledged to declare national emergencies on energy and immigration, allowing him to put the US military on the border, drastically limit the rights of asylum-seekers and reopen large swaths of federal land to energy extraction. He repeated his pledge to change the name of Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\" and to take back the Panama Canal.",

      "\"It's insane! We're heading for a general election. The country feels broken. Our economy is stagnant... But most German news outlets just seem obsessed with Trump, Trump, Trump!\"",
      "Iris M\u00fchler, a teacher in engineering in north-east Germany is one of a number of voters I've been talking to ahead of February snap elections. She isn't alone in her perception.",
      "Despite facing a whole raft of its own domestic difficulties - not least in leading EU countries, Germany and France - Europe has been very Trump-focused since he won the US presidential election in November.",
      "The continent had a bumpy ride last time he was in the White House. Many fear Trump 2.0 could be a lot worse. And Europe's traditional powers are already struggling with their own problems.",
      "France and Germany are mired in political and economic woes, the EU as a whole lags behind China and the US in terms of competitiveness, while in the UK, public services are in a woeful state.",
      "So: is the continent prepared for Donald Trump or has it been caught napping at the wheel (again)?",
      "A businessman who dismisses alliances",
      "When it comes to trade and defence, Trump acts more like a transactional businessman than a US statesman who prizes transatlantic alliances dating back to World War Two.",
      "\"He simply doesn't believe in win-win partnerships,\" the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel told me. She experienced Trump last time he was in office and concluded he views the world through the prism of winners and losers.",
      "He's convinced that Europe has taken advantage of the US for years and that's got to stop.",
      "Leaders in Europe have watched open-mouthed these last weeks since Trump won the US presidential election, for the second time. He's chosen to publicly lambast allies in Europe and Canada, rather than focus his ire on those he recognises as a strategic threat, like China.",
      "Trump dangles the possibility of abandoning Nato - the transatlantic military alliance that Europe has relied on for its security for decades. He has said he'd \"encourage\" Russia to do \"whatever the hell they want\" with European allies if they \"don't pay\" their way more and boost their defence spending.",
      "When it comes to trade, Trump is clearly as livid with the EU now as he was during his first term in office. The bloc sells far more to the United States than it imports from the US. In January 2022, the trade surplus was \u20ac15.4 billion (\u00a313 billion).",
      "Donald Trump's answer? He says he'll impose blanket tariffs on all foreign imports of 10-20%, with even higher tariffs on certain goods like cars.",
      "That's a disaster scenario for Germany, which relies on exports and the automobile industry in particular. Its economy is already spluttering - last year it shrunk by 0.2%.",
      "As the biggest economy in the eurozone, financial difficulties in Germany risk affecting the currency as a whole.",
      "Germany is 'top of Trump's hit list'",

      "\"What he said in the past is things like, he doesn't want to see any Mercedes-Benz on the streets of New York. Now, this is kind of nuts, because, actually, most of the Mercedes-Benz that you see on the streets of New York are made in Alabama, where Mercedes has a big plant.",
      "\"He has often been more hostile to Germany than any other country in Europe. It might be slightly easier for Germany with a new and more conservative government (after the upcoming general election), but I wouldn't be holding my breath.\"",
      "The UK hopes to avoid Trump tariffs as it doesn't have such a trade imbalance with the US, but it may well get lashed by tail winds if it comes to an EU-US trade war.",
      "How prepared Europe is, really",
      "Trump's bullish style can come as no surprise to allies after his first term in the White House. The real conundrum for Europe now is his unpredictability: How much is bluster and intimidation and how much is a promise of action?",
      "Ian Lesser, vice president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States think tank, believes Trump's tariff threats are real and that Europe is far from ready.",
      "\"They're not prepared, no one really is. This very different approach to global trade upsets many cornerstones of the international economy, which has evolved over decades.\"",
      "The European Commission claims to be ready for any number of moves by Trump when he returns to the White House. It is a huge trade power on the world stage. But Mr Lesser says the biggest impact on Europe could come if Trump launches an aggressive trade war against China. That could result in supply chain disruptions for Europe and Beijing dumping even more cheap products on European markets, to the detriment of local businesses.",
      "\"For Europe it's double exposure: exposure to what America might do and then what China will do in response.\"",
      "Trade, defence and the Musk factor",
      "What complicates things further is that trade and defence aren't separate issues for Trump and his administration. He recently refused to rule out economic and/or military action against EU and Nato member Denmark if it didn't hand over the autonomous territory Greenland to the US.",
      "And Trump's incoming vice president appeared, this autumn, to make US defence of Europe conditional on EU regulatory bodies stepping away from the social platform X.",
      "JD Vance warned the US could pull its support for Nato if the EU continued a longstanding investigation into X, which is owned by Trump's Golden Boy, Elon Musk.",
      "Recently, Mr Musk also displayed a keenness for taking sides in European politics. He launched repeated online attacks against centre-left European leaders Sir Keir Starmer in the UK and outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Musk posted on X that the extreme anti-migration AfD party was Germany's only hope.",
      "This shocked many in Europe but pollsters suggest Mr Musk's controversial posts have little actual influence on European public opinion.",
      "Trump and Mr Musk are widely distrusted in Europe, as clearly illustrated in a new poll commissioned by the European Council of Foreign Relations, entitled The EU and global public opinion after the US elections.",
      "From ego flattering to flashing cash",
      "In the end, different European leaders have different approaches to \"Taming the Trump,\" as insiders describe attempts. Some flatter his not-exactly-tiny ego.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is the expert here. He was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on social media after his re-election in November and he swiftly invited him to attend the glittering and dignitary-resplendent re-opening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.",
      "When he was first in the White House, President Macron wowed Trump as guest of honour at the annual display of pomp and military might of Bastille Day in Paris.",
      "The UK, meanwhile, knows Trump has a soft spot for Scotland, where his mother comes from, and for the British Royal Family. He visibly relished attending a state banquet with the now-late Queen Elizabeth II in 2019. He heaped praise on Prince William after sitting down with him this autumn.",
      "Others in Europe favour flashing the cash.",
      "European Central Bank (ECB) chief, Christine Lagarde, has advised Europe's leaders to adopt a \"cheque-book strategy\" and negotiate with Trump rather than retaliate against his proposed tariffs.",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, speaks of buying more (expensive) US liquified natural gas (LNG) as part of Europe's effort to diversify its energy supplies. It has been weaning itself off a reliance on cheap Russian gas since the Kremlin launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Sources in the Commission also speak of possibly buying more US agricultural products and weapons.",
      "Should Europe be more self-sufficient?",
      "Macron, meanwhile, has long advocated what he calls \"strategic autonomy\" - essentially Europe learning to be more self-sufficient, in order to survive.",
      "\"Europe... can die and that depends entirely on our choices,\" he said this spring.",
      "Covid showed Europe how dependent it was on Chinese imports, like medicines. Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine exposed Europe's over-reliance on Russian energy.",
      "Macron is now sounding the alarm about the US: \"The United States of America has two priorities. The USA first, and that is legitimate, and the China issue, second. And the European issue is not a geopolitical priority for the coming years and decades.\"",
      "Trump's return to the White House is making European leaders think about continental weaknesses.",
      "The big question around defence",
      "When it comes to defence, Trump's insistence that Europe spend more is generally accepted (though how much more is a hot topic of debate). But where Trump talks in terms of increasing GDP spending, Europeans are discussing how to spend their defence budgets more wisely and in a more joined-up way to boost continental safety.",
      "Emmanuel Macron wants an EU-wide industrial defence policy. He says the war in Ukraine illustrated that \"our fragmentation is a weakness... We have sometimes discovered ourselves, as Europeans, that our guns were not of the same calibre, that our missiles did not match.\"",
      "Europe frets that Trump will not want to continue being the main sponsor of military aid to Ukraine as was the case under the Biden administration.",
      "Next month, EU leaders have invited the UK - one of Europe's two big military powers - to an informal summit to discuss working together better on security and defence.",
      "The EU's defence chief and former Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, believes European unity of purpose is needed. \"We need to act in a united way. Then, we are strong. Then, we are also serious on the world stage.\"",
      "Weaker and more fractured? Europe today",
      "There are analysts who say Europe is in a far weaker, more fractured state to deal with Trump 2.0 than it was in 2016 when he was first elected. I'd say the answer to that is yes. But also no.",
      "Yes - as discussed, economic growth is sluggish and politics are volatile.",
      "Populist nationalist eurosceptic parties are gaining strength in many European countries. Some, like Germany's AfD, are soft on Moscow - while others like Italian PM Giorgia Meloni may be tempted to prioritise transatlantic ties with Trump rather than European unity.",
      "But beware of looking back at Europe when Trump was first elected president through rose-tinted spectacles.",
      "Financially, northern Europe was definitely doing better than it is now, but, in terms of unity, the continent was deeply divided on the back of the migrant crisis in 2015. Populist eurosceptic parties were also on the rise then and, following the Brexit vote in June 2016, there were widespread predictions the EU would soon lose other member countries and fall apart altogether.",
      "Fast forward to 2025 and the EU has weathered Brexit, the Covid pandemic, the migration crisis and Trump's first term in office - and countries very much pulled together after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "It was more of a stumbling, rather than sailing through these successive crises, but the EU is still standing and the wounds of Brexit, for example, have healed with time.",
      "Post-Brexit UK is seen by the EU as a close ally that shares the same values in a world threatened by an ambitious China, an expansionist Russia and an unpredictable, bullish incoming US president.",
      "Nato, meanwhile, though worried about Trump's commitment to the alliance, has been boosted militarily and geostrategically by Sweden and Russian neighbour Finland becoming members following the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Maybe, just maybe, Trump will see fewer differences that frustrate and antagonise him about Europe this time round.",
      "It's a Europe that recognises the need to spend more on defence, as he demands; that is far warier of China, as he expects, and that is more right-leaning in its politics, as he prefers.",
      "Is it a Europe whose leaders also stand up to Trump, despite threats and bluster, if they feel he crosses a line - be it over human rights, free speech or dallying with dictators?",

      "The UN has previously estimated that 60% of structures across Gaza have been damaged or destroyed.",
      "Though the sounds of bombing were replaced by celebrations as the ceasefire began on Sunday, the reality facing people across Gaza remains desperate.",
      "According to the UN World Food Programme (WFP), the war has left more than two million Gazans homeless, without income, and completely dependent on food aid to survive.",
      "That aid began to enter Gaza immediately after the ceasefire on Sunday and the UN said at least 630 lorries went into the Strip before the end of the day - the highest number since the start of the war 15 months ago.",
      "Sam Rose, acting director of Unrwa, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency in Gaza, said the aid supplies were just the beginning in the challenge of bringing the strip back to life.",

      "Though the risk from air strikes is gone, for now, the grim work continues for the remaining Civil Defence workers.

      "Ninety-four of their comrades were killed. More than 300 were wounded - nearly half the civil defence organisation in Gaza.",

      "Still, Hatem kept going, into the place of explosions, collapsing buildings, the rubble where the dead and occasionally the living were buried. He pulled out bodies, and parts of bodies.",

      "Israel banned the foreign media from entering Gaza to report the war independently.",
      "The BBC's local journalists have been on the streets almost non-stop for the last 24 hours capturing the mood of Gaza in the time of ceasefire: a gunman standing in the roadway in Nuseirat in central Gaza, firing into the air; Hamas fighters and police re-emerging; a few yards down the road another group of men shooting towards the sky; crowds gathering at cross streets and on corners; a man kneeling and kissing the ground.",
      "But all of this is taking place against a backdrop of ruin. Trucks and cars trundle past, weighed down with people's belongings. Some use donkey carts to haul what possessions have survived after their multiple displacements.",
      "There are hundreds of thousands of journeys in Gaza today. Some are actually under way. Others exist in the imagination. All have one direction - home.",
      "Prof Jumaa Abu Shiha arrives at what remains of his house in Nuseirat.",
      "First, he says the feeling of having survived is \"indescribable\". He prays to himself: \"God is the best disposer of our affairs.\"",
      "He repeats this as he goes from one ruined room to another. His wife and several children follow.",
      "Walls are blown out. The interiors are scarred with machine gun and shrapnel marks.",
      "Prof Abu Shiha describes how he built the house \"block by block\", painted it and cherished the moment he brought his family to live here.",
      "\"I can't find a house, I can only see destruction not a house,\" he says. \"I didn't expect this. I was expecting to come back to a house and find a place to shelter me and my children.\"",
      "He points to his daughters' room, and his sons' room, so carefully decorated and now laid waste. \"The feeling is indescribable,\" he says.",
      "There is a massive task of rebuilding ahead. The UN and aid agencies have repeatedly accused Israel of obstructing the flow of aid; the United States at one point threatened to curb military assistance to Israel unless more aid was allowed into Gaza. Israel denies restricting aid.",
      "Aid trucks were crossing into the strip throughout the afternoon. Among them was a convoy from the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization, which we reported on last week, on the journey from Amman towards Gaza.",
      "Forklift trucks moved tonnes of medicine and food to help the nearly two million displaced in Gaza - roughly 90% of the population.",
      "Such aid is tangible assistance. It can be weighed, counted, loaded, and ultimately distributed. People can be fed and given medicine. But there is another challenge whose demands are immense, and which will have a profound impact on the future of Gaza.",
      "The war has created unknown numbers of traumatised adults and children. We have recorded some of their stories but are aware of the tens of thousands more that remain untold.",
      "Children have faced acute suffering. According to a survey of the caregivers of 504 children, for the UK charity War Child, 96% of children felt death was imminent.",
      "The interviews also found that 49% had a desire to die. Frequently our journalists have heard young survivors say they wished they could join a dead mother, father, or sibling.",
      "Ten-year-old Amr al Hindi was the sole survivor of an Israeli strike on the building where he lived in Beit Lahia last October. Our colleague in the area filmed Amr in hospital just after the attack.",

      "\"Where's Sherif?\" Amr asked repeatedly. A nurse told him Sherif was OK. \"I will take you upstairs to see him.\" But Sherif, his brother, did not survive. Nor did his other brother, Ali, or his sister Aseel, or his mother and father. The whole family was gone.",
      "Just after the ceasefire agreement was announced we went back to see what had become of Amr al Hindi. He was living with his grandparents, and it was clear they loved him with care and tenderness. The child had three of his toes amputated after the bombing, but was managing to walk normally.",
      "Amr sat on his grandfather's lap and stared directly at the camera. He was still, and composed, as if he was looking out from behind a thick protective screen. He began to speak about his brother Ali and how he had wanted to go to Jordan and study to become a doctor.",
      "\"I wish to become like Ali. I want to fulfil his dream, and travel to Jordan to become a doctor,\" he said. But over the last few words tears began to fall and he broke into sobs.",

      "The last time Thailand deported Uyghur asylum seekers was in July 2015. Without warning, it put 109 of them onto a plane back to China, prompting a storm of protest from governments and human rights groups.",
      "The few photos that were released show them hooded and handcuffed, guarded by large numbers of Chinese police officers. Little is known about what happened to them after their return. Other deported Uyghurs have received long prison sentences in secret trials.",

      "Driving along the narrow, congested road known as Suan Phlu it is easy to miss the non-descript cluster of cement buildings, and difficult to believe they house an estimated 900 detainees \u2013 the Thai authorities give out no precise numbers.",
      "The IDC is known to be hot, overcrowded and unsanitary. Journalists are not allowed inside. Lawyers usually warn their clients to avoid being sent there if at all possible.",
      "There are 43 Uyghurs there, plus another five being held in a Bangkok prison for trying to escape. They are the last of around 350 who fled China in 2013 and 2014.",
      "They are kept in isolation from other inmates and are rarely allowed visits by outsiders or lawyers. They get few opportunities to exercise, or even to see daylight. They have been charged with no crime, apart from entering Thailand without a visa. Five Uyghurs have died in custody.",

      "\"There is not enough food \u2013 it is mostly just soup made with cucumber and chicken bones. It is crammed in there. The water they get, both for drinking and washing, is dirty. Only basic medicines are provided and these are inadequate. If someone falls ill, it takes a long time to get an appointment with the doctor. And because of the dirty water, the hot weather and bad ventilation, a lot of the Uyghurs get rashes or other skin problems.\"",
      "But the worst part of their detention, say those who have experienced it, is not knowing how long they will be imprisoned in Thailand, and the constant fear of being sent back to China.",
      "Niluper says there were always rumours about deportation but it was difficult to find out more. Escaping was hard because they had children with them.",

      "China's repression of the Muslim Uyghurs has been well documented by the UN and human rights groups. Up to one million Uyghurs are believed to have been detained in re-education camps, in what human rights advocates say is a state campaign to eradicate Uyghur identity and culture. There are many allegations of torture and enforced disappearances, which China denies. It says it has been running \"vocational centres\" focused on de-radicalising Uyghurs.",
      "Niluper says she and her husband faced hostility from Chinese state officials over their religiosity - her husband was an avid reader of religious texts.",
      "The couple made the decision to flee when people they knew were being arrested or disappearing. The family were in a group of 220 Uyghurs who were caught by the Thai police trying to cross the border to Malaysia in March 2014.",
      "Niluper was held in an IDC near the border, and then later in Bangkok, until with 170 other women and children, she was allowed in June 2015 to go to Turkey, which usually offers Uyghurs asylum.",
      "But her husband remains in the Bangkok IDC. They were separated when they were detained, and she has had no contact with him since a brief meeting they were permitted in July 2014.",

      "Pressure from Beijing",
      "Thailand has never explained why it will not allow the remaining Uyghurs to join their families in Turkey, but it is almost certainly because of pressure from China.",
      "Unlike other inmates in the IDC, the fate of the Uyghurs is not handled by the Immigration Department but instead by Thailand's National Security Council, a body chaired by the prime minister in which the military has significant influence.",
      "As the influence of the US, Thailand's oldest military ally, wanes, that of China has been steadily increasing. The current Thai government is keen to build even closer ties to China, to help revive the faltering economy.",
      "The United Nations Refugee Agency has been accused of doing little to help the Uyghurs, but says it is given no access to them, so is unable to do much. Thailand does not recognise refugee status.",
      "Accommodating China's wish to get the Uyghurs back is not without risk though. Thailand has just taken a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, for which it lobbied hard.",

      "Thailand will also be mindful of what happened just a month after the last mass deportation in 2015.",
      "On 17 August that year a powerful bomb exploded at a shrine in Bangkok which was popular with Chinese tourists. Twenty people were killed, in what was widely assumed to be a retaliation by Uyghur militants, although the Thai authorities tried to downplay the link.",
      "Two Uyghur men were charged with the bombing, but their trial has lasted for nine years, with no end in sight. One of them, say his lawyers, is almost certainly innocent. A veil of secrecy surrounds the trial; the authorities seem reluctant to let anything from the hearings tying the bomb to the deportation to get out.",
      "Even those Uyghurs who have managed to get to Turkey must then deal with their uncertain status there, and with the severance of all communications with their families in Xinjiang.",

      "Under a strange pink-purple glow, illuminated panels buzz and cylindrical columns of water bubble away, as a futuristic crop of microalgae grows.",
      "It's here that Iceland's Vaxa Technologies has developed a system that harnesses energy and other resources from the nearby power plant, to cultivate these tiny aquatic organisms.",
      "\u201cIt's a new way of thinking about food production,\u201d says general manager, Kristinn Haflidason as he gives me a tour of the space-age facility.",
      "For much of our history, humans have consumed seaweed, also know as macroalgae.",
      "But its tiny relative, microalgae has been a less common food source, although it was eaten for centuries in ancient Central America and Africa.",
      "Now scientists and entrepreneurs are increasingly exploring its potential as a nutrition-rich, sustainable food.",
      "About 35 minutes from the capital Reykjavik, the Vaxa site produces the microalgae Nannochloropsis, both as food for people, and for feed in fish and shrimp farming.",
      "It also grows a type of bacteria called Arthospira, also known as blue-green algae, as it shares similar properties with microalgae.",
      "When dried out it's know as spirulina and is used as a dietary supplements, a food ingredients, and as a bright-blue food colouring.",
      "These tiny organisms photosynthesise, capturing energy from light to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.",
      "\u201cThe algae is eating CO2, or turning the CO2 into biomass,\u201d explains Mr Haflidason. \u201cIt's carbon negative.\u201d",
      "Vaxa's plant has a unique situation.",
      "It's the only place where algae cultivation is integrated with a geothermal power station, which supplies clean electricity, delivers cold water for cultivation, hot water for heating, and even pipes across its CO2 emissions.",
      "\u201cYou end up with a slightly negative carbon footprint,\u201d says Asger Munch Smidt-Jensen, a food technology consultant at Danish Technology Institute (DTI), who co-authored a study assessing the environmental impact of Vaxa\u2019s spirulina production.",
      "\u201cWe also found a relatively low footprint, both in terms of land and water use.\u201d",
      "Round-the-clock renewable energy, plus a stream of CO2, and nutrients with a low carbon footprint, are needed to ensure the setup is climate-friendly, and he thinks that isn\u2019t easily replicated.",
      "\u201cThere is a huge input of energy to run these photo-bioreactors, and you have to artificially simulate the sun, so you need a high energy light source,\u201d he explains.",
      "\"My main takeaway is that we should utilise these areas [like Iceland] where we have low impact energy sources to make energy intensive products,\u201d adds Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen.",
      "Back at the algae plant, I climb onto an elevated platform, where I\u2019m surrounded by noisy modular units called photo-bioreactors, where thousands upon thousands of tiny red and blue LED lights fuel the microalgae\u2019s growth, in place of sunlight.",
      "They\u2019re also supplied water and nutrients.",
      "\u201cMore than 90% of the photosynthesis happens within very specific wavelengths of red and blue light,\u201d explains Mr Haflidason. \u201cWe are only giving them the light that they use.\u201d",
      "All the conditions are tightly controlled and optimised by machine learning, he adds.",
      "About 7% of the crop is harvested daily, and rapidly replenished by new growth.",
      "Vaxa\u2019s facility can produce up to 150 metric tonnes of algae annually, and it plans to expand.",
      "As the crops are rich in protein, carbohydrate, omega-3s, fatty-acids, and vitamin B12, Mr Haflidason believes growing microalgae this way, could help tackle global food insecurity.",
      "Many other companies are betting on the potential of microalgae - it's estimated the market will be worth $25.4bn (\u00a320.5bn) by 2033.",
      "Danish start-up Algiecel has been trialling portable shipping container-sized modules that house photo-bioreactors, and which could link up to carbon-emitting industries to capture their CO2, while simultaneously producing food and feed.",
      "Crops are also being used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, biofuel and a replacement for plastic.",
      "Perhaps also microalgae could be produced in space.",
      "In a project funded by the European Space Agency, the Danish Technological Institution plans to test if a microalgae can be grown on the International Space Station.",
      "Despite all the investment, there\u2019s some way to go before micro-algae become an everyday part of our diet.",
      "It still needs a lot of development, according to Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen.",
      "He points out that the texture lacks firmness. Meanwhile the taste can be \"fishy\" if the algae is a saltwater variety.",
      "\u201cBut there are ways of coming overcoming this,\u201d he adds.",
      "There\u2019s also the societal question.",
      "\u201cAre people ready for it? How do we make it so that everyone wants to eat this?\"",
      "Malene Lihme Olsen, a food scientist at Copenhagen University who researches micro algae, says its nutritional value needs more research.",
      "\"Green microalgae [chlorella] have a very robust cell wall, so it can be difficult for us to digest and get all the nutrients,\u201d she says.",
      "For now she says microalgae is better added to other \u201ccarrier products\u201d like pasta or bread to help with taste, texture and appearance.",
      "However, Ms Olsen believes microalgae are a promising future food.",
      "\u201cIf you compare one hectare of soy in Brazil, and imagine we had one hectare of algae field, you could produce 15 times more protein a year [from the algae].\u201d",
      "Back at the plant I'm looking at an unappetising green sludge. It's the harvested microalgae with the water squeezed out, ready for further processing.",
      "Mr Haflidason offers me a taste and, after initial reluctance, I try some and find its flavour neutral with a texture like tofu.",
      "\u201cWe are absolutely not proposing that anyone should eat green sludge,\u201d jokes Mr Haflidason.",
      "Instead the processed algae is an ingredient for everyday foods, and in Reykjavik one bakery makes bread with Spirulina and a gym puts it in smoothies.",

    "story": [
      "The mother of US journalist Austin Tice, abducted in Syria while on a reporting trip in 2012 and one of the longest-held American hostages, has returned to the country for the first time in a decade to renew the search for her son.",
      "Debra Tice's visit comes in the wake of the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in a lighting rebel offensive last month. Her son, a freelance journalist who is now 43, was taken captive as he travelled through the Damascus suburb of Darayya covering the Syrian civil war.",
      "\"We had information, but the whole world changed,\" she said in an interview in the Syrian capital, Damascus, referring to Assad's removal from power.",
      "\"We have no idea where he is now. It feels a little bit like square one, trying to figure that out again.\"",
      "Tice was last seen in a video posted online weeks after his capture, blindfolded and in apparent distress. No government or group has claimed being behind his disappearance, although over the years, US officials said they believed Tice was being held by the Assad government.",
      "According to recent reports in US media, investigators believe that Tice, a former US Marine, briefly escaped weeks after being seized but was recaptured by forces who answered directly to Assad.",
      "Last month, after rebels led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) toppled Assad and seized power, President Joe Biden said the US believed Tice was alive, but that his whereabouts remained unknown. The rebels opened Syria's prisons, releasing thousands of people and giving experts access to documents that could shed a light on what happened to Tice and other disappeared people.",

      "The first wife of South Africa's Zulu King Misuzulu kaZwelithini has failed in her legal attempt to halt his plans to take a third wife.",
      "Queen Ntokozo kaMayisela went to court ahead of what was expected to be the wedding later this week.",
      "But despite the ruling, it is not clear whether the wedding will still go ahead as planned.",
      "On Saturday, South African media quoted a letter reportedly from the king saying the ceremony had been called off \"due to reasons beyond the control of the royal house\".",
      "Polygamous marriages are recognised in South Africa but only if they are registered as customary weddings.",
      "This latest row comes amid a series of scandals that has hit King Misuzulu since he came to power just over two years ago.",
      "The Zulu king does not have formal political power and the monarch's role within broader South African society is largely ceremonial, but he remains hugely influential with a yearly government-funded budget of several million dollars.",

      "In pictures: King Misuzulu crowned in historic ceremony",
      "Before he was enthroned, the king married Mayisela in 2021 in a civil marriage.",
      "In her legal argument heard in the high court on Monday, the queen, through her lawyer, said that the king could not marry anyone else as their marriage was still in force.",
      "Under South African law, a civil marriage must either be dissolved or converted to a traditional union before a man can take any more wives.",
      "It is not clear why the marriage contract was not an issue when the king took a second wife, Queen Nozizwe Mulela-Zulu, back in 2022.",
      "But according to South Africa's weekly Sunday World newspaper, citing a letter Queen Mayisela had written to elders in the Zulu royal house, the couple had agreed to convert their marriage from civil to traditional.",
      "The duo, given the option of either divorcing and remarrying or applying for the conversion by their legal team, apparently opted to do the latter but King Misuzulu \"decided to change his mind\" for unknown reasons, the queen reportedly said.",
      "In rejecting Monday's application to halt the king's marriage to Nomzamo Myeni, Judge Bongani Mngadi said that as the queen had already consented to the idea that her husband could marry other women, she could not prevent a ceremony from taking place.",
      "Despite the reported letter, as well as the king's lawyer in court, saying that the wedding would not take place, contradictory statements have also emerged.",
      "South African news site TimesLIVE is reporting that the bride-to-be said she knew nothing about the letter and as far as she understood, her wedding would proceed as initially planned.",
      "According to another news site, IOL, which reportedly spoke to the couple, the king insisted that he loved Myeni and would \"marry her by force\".",
      "Since his coronation in October 2022, there has been controversy around some of the decisions King Misuzulu has made.",
      "In December, he unlawfully suspended the board of the Ingonyama Trust, which owns and controls vast tracts of communal land in KwaZulu-Natal, which is supposed to be for the benefit and welfare of communities under the king's leadership in the region.",
      "King Misuzulu is the sole trustee and chairperson of the trust but has no powers to hire or fire board members.",
      "He has also recently summarily fired two close aides, including his traditional prime minister, in quick succession - moves which raised eyebrows among royal watchers.",
      "Misuzulu's position as king is also being questioned by some and a legal case is currently under way challenging his recognition as monarch by the state.",
      "He ascended to the throne sooner than expected after his father, King Goodwill Zwelithini, died during the Covid pandemic in March 2021 of diabetes-related complications.",
      "Zwelithini was the Zulu nation's longest-reigning monarch, having served on the throne for almost 50 years.",

      "In a message to Trump shared on Monday, Pope Francis offered him \"cordial greetings\" and urged him to lead a society with \"no room for hatred, discrimination or exclusion\" and promote \"peace and reconciliation among peoples\".",
      "The Pope is known to hold the issue of migrants dear. During a public audience last August, he said that \"systematically working by all means to drive away migrants\" was \"a grave sin\".",
      "In 2016, before the first presidential election won by Trump, Pope Francis said \"a person who thinks only about building walls... and not of building bridges, is not Christian\".",
      "Referring to Trump's promise to build a wall on the Mexican border to keep migrants from travelling into the US, Francis said: \"I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that. We must see if he said things in that way and I will give him the benefit of the doubt.\"",
      "Francis and Trump later met when Trump and his family visited Rome in 2017.",
      "Before the US presidential election in 2024, the Pope declined to say whether people should vote for Trump or for his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris, merely urging people to choose \"the lesser evil\" according to their conscience.",
      "During the interview on Sunday evening, Francis also touched on the issue of migration to Europe, saying there was \"a lot of cruelty\" and that everyone had \"the right to remain home and the right to emigrate\".",
      "The Pope also added that some of the southern European countries that receive the most migrant arrivals \"are not having any children and need manpower\".",
      "\"In some of these countries, there are entire villages that are empty. A good, well-thought out migrant policy would help countries like Italy and Spain too,\" he said.",
      "In another section of the interview, Francis was asked about the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and said he did not know why making peace was so difficult.",
      "\"I don't know why... it's as if there was an international drive towards self-destruction,\" the Pope said.",
      "Francis, 88, has been in the post since 2013, when he was elected to succeed Pope Benedict XVI.",

      "But it is a favourite food of other fish species like cod and haddock, as well as threatened seabirds such as puffins and kittiwakes.",
      "The UK has effectively stopped its own vessels from fishing the species since 2021 through its licensing regime, on the grounds it is required to prevent overfishing and protect the North Sea ecosystem.",
      "Rishi Sunak's Conservative government then banned all vessels from catching the species in English waters of the sea in March last year, with a similar ban in Scottish waters brought in by ministers in the SNP-led Scottish government.",
      "It won the UK plaudits from conservation groups, which had long campaigned for an outright ban, and Sir Keir's Labour government has kept the ban in place since taking power in July.",
      "But it has outraged Danish fishermen, who sell sandeel to animal feed and fish oil producers and under the post-Brexit trade deal hold the right to fish the overwhelming majority of the EU's share of the species in UK waters.",
      "Small fish, big row",
      "The dispute centres on whether the UK's right to restrict trawlers for conservation reasons unnecessarily restricts agreed EU fishing rights.",
      "In its submissions to the court, the EU has argued the geographical scope of the ban is not justified by the scientific modelling on stock levels, or the \"economic and social impacts\" on Danish fishing communities.",
      "In a response published by the court, the UK has defended the scientific advice behind the ban, adding that the EU has failed to point out \"any superior model\" available at the time.",
      "It added that the UK was within its rights to bring in the ban, highlighting that the trade agreement itself commits both sides to taking account of the impact of fishing on marine diversity.",
      "The UK decision to continue the ban has been backed by an unlikely coalition stretching across three political parties, conservation groups and committed Brexiteers.",
      "The renewable energy industry has also taken an interest, arguing the ban helps achieve the necessary level of seabird \"resilience\" to allow more wind farms to be built whilst still hitting conservation targets.",
      "The UK has previously estimated sandeel caught in its waters is worth around \u00a345m a year, a tiny industry in the context of the wider trade relationship.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has promised to unleash a blitz of executive orders now that he has been sworn in as the 47th US president, after calling for a \"revolution of common sense\" in Monday's inaugural address.",

      "Immigration and the border",
      "National emergency at the border",
      "Trump said during his inaugural address that he would sign an executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern border - and ordering the Department of Defense to more heavily allocate resources and manpower to it.",
      "\"Remain in Mexico\"",
      "His White House will also re-implement his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy in a day-one executive order, he said. A measure from his first term, it returned about 70,000 non-Mexican asylum seekers across the border to Mexico to await hearings.",
      "Terrorism designation for gangs and cartels",
      "The president will officially designate cartels and international gangs as foreign terrorist organisations, according to his inaugural address. Central American MS-13 and Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua will be added to a list that includes Al Qaeda, the so-called Islamic State and Hamas.",
      "Resume wall-building",
      "When Trump was first elected president in 2016, he signed an executive order to build a border wall. Although parts of the wall have been built, there is still much left uncompleted, and an official told reporters before the inauguration that Trump would issue a directive to finish what he started.",
      "End birthright citizenship",
      "Trump has called the constitutional right that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen \"ridiculous\". Trump officials also told reporters that the president would deny birthright citizenship to the children of immigrants who are in the US illegally.",
      "But doing that could prove much more difficult than simply issuing an executive order, and is expected to face legal challenges.",
      "Refugee and asylum seekers",
      "Trump will suspend refugee admissions into the US for at least four months, officials also said. He also plans to use his presidential powers to \"end\" asylum by proclamation to fast-track deportations at the US-Mexico border.",

      "Death penalty for certain immigrant criminals",

      "Deportations",
      "Trump vowed to end the practice of \"catch and release\" during his speech on Monday. The policy allows migrants to live in US communities while they await their hearings.",
      "He has previously promised to \"launch the largest deportation program in American history\" and end a longtime policy that has kept federal immigration authorities from conducting raids on churches and schools.",
      "These pledges could face legal and logistical challenges.",
      "Closing the border on health grounds",
      "A 1944 measure called Title 42 allows the US government to curb migration to protect public health. It was last used during the pandemic, but US media report that the new administration is looking for a disease that would help justify its plans to close the southern US border with Mexico.",

      "Inflation",

      "Tariffs",
      "On his first day in office, Trump is only expected to direct federal agencies to \"study trade policies and evaluate US trade relationships with China and America's continental neighbours\", according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Trump previously promised 10% tariffs on all imports, 25% on Canadian and Mexican goods and 60% on items coming from China.",
      "Tariffs are likely to make consumer goods more expensive and could fuel inflation, experts say. Some countries are considering retaliatory action.",
      "Trump introduced tariffs in his first term - including some on China that former President Joe Biden retained.",
      "Crypto pile",
      "Trump has championed cryptocurrency, and his election saw the value of Bitcoin increase by 30%.",
      "Some believe Trump will move quickly to create a federal \"Bitcoin stockpile\" - a strategic reserve similar to the US's stockpile of gold and oil - that he has said would serve as a \"permanent national asset to benefit all Americans\".",
      "Diversity and gender",
      "Transgender people",
      "Trump said in his inaugural address that he would issue an executive order declaring that \"there are only two genders, male and female\".",
      "Trump officials earlier told reporters that the order would say it was US policy to recognise male and female biologically distinct sexes, rather than \"gender and sex\".",
      "The order is expected to affect transgender policy regarding government communications, civil rights protections and federal funding as well as the approach of US shelters and prisons. It will affect official documents like passports and visas.",
      "DEI",
      "The president said in his address that he would end government efforts to \"socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life\".",
      "Officials said that Trump will order the end of \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" (DEI) programmes \"inside the federal government\", affecting all agencies and even newly adopted names for spaces. The incoming administration promised further actions that could affect the private sector.",
      "Abortion",
      "Like most Republican presidents before him, Trump is expected to reinstate the \"Mexico City policy\", which bans federal aid to international groups that provide abortion counselling.",
      "He is also expected to reinstate an abortion rule that prohibits Title X federal health providers, a low-income family planning programme, from mentioning abortion to patients. This would effectively strip millions of dollars from organisations that offer abortion or provide referrals.",
      "Government reform",
      "Doge and Elon Musk",
      "Trump said on Monday that he would issue an order to form the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - a new advisory body aimed at cutting government costs. It is expected to be co-led by Elon Musk.",
      "Government workers",

      "Foreign policy",
      "America First",
      "Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said that Trump will direct the State Department to adopt an \"American-First\" foreign policy. This order could reportedly include large cuts to US foreign aid.",
      "Cuba and Venezuela",
      "Trump could use executive orders to undo Biden's recent decision to remove Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism. He could also reinstate sanctions against Venezuela. Both countries were frequent targets of his ire during his first administration, but officials did not mention it on Monday.",
      "How Trump has already changed the world",
      "'Gulf of America' and other names",
      "\"Gulf of America\"",
      "Among Trump's first executive orders will be one that directs the secretary of the interior to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\", he said in his inaugural address.",
      "Alaska's Mount Denali",
      "He said his executive order will also call for Alaska's Mount Denali to have its named reverted to Mount McKinley - in honour of America's 25th president whose tariff policies Trump admires. The highest mountain peak in North America, President Barack Obama changed the name to Denali to reflect what it was called by native tribes.",

      "Trump said his order would give TikTok's parent company more time to find a US partner to buy a majority stake.",
      "The new president previously backed a ban, but indicated he had reversed his stance after his campaign videos attracted billions of views.",
      "Capitol riot",
      "Free Jan 6 \"hostages\"",
      "Trump is preparing to issue sweeping pardons for many of those charged in the 6 January riot at the US Capitol building in 2021 and commute the sentences of those who attacked police, US media reports.",
      "He has repeatedly referred to those arrested as \"hostages\" and has said he is \"inclined to pardon many of them\".",
      "More than 1,500 individuals were arrested in relation to the event. At least 600 were charged with assaulting or impeding federal officers.",

      "He also plans - presumably with the help of Elon Musk's \"Department of Government Efficiency\" - to swiftly fire huge numbers of civil servants and officials.",
      "Trump still believes there is a \"deep state\" within the US government that will try to frustrate his agenda. So we can expect a far more drastic clear-out of federal employees than would normally come with a change of administration, and a far more politicised government machine behind him.",
      "Many of his plans, like major tax cuts for big corporations and the very wealthy, will need legislation passed by Congress.",

And the resistance movement that mobilised before Trump's first term, prompting days of nationwide protests after his inauguration that brought more than a million people onto the streets, appears less energised this time.",
      "After his 2020 election defeat, Trump was kicked off social media platforms following the Capitol riot and his baseless claims of voter fraud.

      "There's little doubt that his mass of executive orders on day one will feature some eye-catching actions designed to titillate his base. Like issuing presidential pardons for many, if not all, of the people convicted over the Capitol riot. His supporters will be thrilled to see the people they regard as political hostages freed from jail.",

      "Trump has promised orders that will ramp up artificial intelligence programmes, form the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), make records available related to the assassination of John F Kennedy in 1963, direct the military to create an Iron Dome missile defence shield and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies from the military.",
      "During his previous term, he signed 220 executive orders, some of which were challenged in the courts.",
      "What is an executive order?",
      "It is a written order issued by the president to the federal government which does not require congressional approval.",
      "Orders range from dramatic reverses of policy, like Trump's approval for the construction of two bitterly contested oil pipelines in 2017, to ordinary business, such as Barack Obama's instructions on half-day closing for government departments, external on Christmas Eve 2015.",
      "Authority for issuing the orders is rooted in Article II of the US constitution, external, which states: \"The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America.\"",
      "Why do presidents issue them?",
      "Roosevelt issued several thousand orders",
      "Sometimes the orders are made during wartime or to avert a domestic crisis. In February 1942, President Franklin D Roosevelt signed an executive order that led to the creation of detention centres for about 120,000 Japanese Americans.",

    "story": [
      "Chappell Roan can't be stopped.",
      "Over the last 12 months, the 26-year-old has become the buzziest star in pop. A flamboyant, flame-haired sensation, whose songs are as colourful as they are raw.",
      "Her debut album, released to little fanfare in 2023, has just topped the UK charts for a second time. Next week, she's up for six Grammy awards, including best new artist. And BBC Radio 1 have named her their Sound Of 2025.",
      "Success has been all the sweeter because her former record label refused to release many of the songs that exploded onto the charts last year.",

      "Reaching pop's A-list isn't just a vindication but a revolution.",
      "The 26-year-old is the first female pop star to achieve mainstream success as an openly queer person, rather than coming out as part of their post-fame narrative.",
      "On a more personal level, she's finally got the financial security to move into a house of her own, and acquire a rescue cat, named Cherub Lou.",
      "\"She's super tiny, her breath smells so bad, and she doesn't have a meow,\" the singer dotes.",
      "If kitten ownership is a benefit of fame, Roan has bristled at the downsides.",
      "She has spoken out against abusive fans, calling out \"creepy behaviour\" from people who harass her in airport queues and \"stalk\" her parents' home. Last September, she went viral for cussing a photographer who'd been shouting abuse at stars on the red carpet of the MTV Awards.",
      "\"I was looking around, and I was like, 'This is what people are OK with all the time? And I'm supposed to act normal? This is not normal. This is crazy',\" she recalls.",
      "The incident made headlines. British tabloids called her outburst the \"tantrum\" of a \"spoiled diva\".",
      "But Roan is unapologetic.",
      "\"I've been responding that way to disrespect my whole life - but now there are cameras on me, and I also happen to be a pop star, and those things don't match. It's like oil and water.\"",
      "Roan says musicians are trained to be obedient. Standing up for yourself is portrayed as whining or ingratitude, and rejecting convention comes at a cost.",
      "\"I think, actually, I'd be more successful if I was OK wearing a muzzle,\" she laughs.",
      "\"If I were to override more of my basic instincts, where my heart is going, 'Stop, stop, stop, you're not OK', I would be bigger.",
      "\"I would be way bigger... And I would still be on tour right now.\"",
      "Indeed, Roan rejected the pressure of extending her 2024 tour to protect her physical and mental health. She credits that resolve to her late grandfather.",
      "\"There's something he said that I think about in every move I make with my career. There are always options.\"",
      "\"So when someone says, 'Do this concert because you'll never get offered that much money ever again', it's like, who cares?",
      "\"If I don't feel like doing this right now, there are always options. There is not a scarcity of opportunity. I think about that all the time.\"",
      "As fans will know by now, Roan was born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz and raised in the Bible Belt town of Willard, Missouri.",
      "The oldest of four children, she aspired to be an actress \u2013 but, for a long time, it seemed her future would be in sport. She ran at state-competition level, and almost went to college for cross-country.",
      "Then she entered a singing contest at the age of 13 and won. Before long, she'd written her first song, about a crush on a Mormon boy who wasn't allowed to date outside his faith.",
      "She took her stage name as a tribute to her grandfather Dennis K Chappell and his favourite song, a Western ballad called The Strawberry Roan.",
      "\"He was very funny and very smart,\" she recalls. \"And I don't think he ever questioned my ability.",
      "\"A lot of people were like, 'You should go completely country', or, 'You should try Christian music'. And he never told me to do anything.",
      "\"He was the only person that was like, 'You don't need a plan B. Just do it'.\"",
      "Drag queen heaven",
      "Eventually, one of her compositions, a gothic ballad called Die Young, caught the attention of Atlantic Records, which signed her at the age of just 17.",
      "Moving to LA, she recorded and released her first EP, School Nights, in 2017. It was a solid but unremarkable affair, steeped in the sounds of Lana Del Rey and Lorde.",
      "Roan only found a sound of her own when a group of gay friends took her to a drag bar.",
      "\"I walked into that club in West Hollywood and it was like heaven,\" she told the BBC last year. \"It was amazing to see all these people who were happy and confident in their bodies.",
      "\"And the go-go dancers! I was enthralled. I couldn't stop watching them. I was like, 'I have to do that'.\"",
      "She didn't become a dancer, but she did write a song imagining what it would be like to be one and how her mother would react. Roan called it Pink Pony Club after a strip bar in her home town.",
      "\"That song changed everything,\" she says. \"It put me in a new category.",
      "\"I never thought I could actually be a 'pop star girl' and Pink Pony forced me into that.\"",
      "Her label disagreed. They refused to release Pink Pony Club for two years. Shortly after they relented, Roan was dropped in a round of pandemic-era cost-cutting.",
      "Bruised but not broken, she went back home and spent the next year serving coffee in a drive-through doughnut shop.",
      "\"It absolutely had a positive impact on me,\" she says. \"You have the knowledge of what it's like to clean a public restroom. That's very important.\"",
      "The period was transformational in other ways. She saved her earnings, had her heart broken by a person \"with pale blue eyes\", moved back to Los Angeles, and gave herself a year to make it.",
      "It might have taken a little longer than that, but she hit the ground running.",
      "During her exile, Roan had stayed in touch with her Pink Pony Club co-writer, Daniel Nigro.",
      "He was also working with another up-and-coming singer called Olivia Rodrigo and, when her career took off, Roan got a courtside seat, supporting Rodrigo on tour and providing backing vocals on her second album, Guts.",
      "More importantly, Nigro used the momentum to sign Roan to his own record label and ensure the release of her debut album in September 2023.",
      "At first, it seemed like Roan's original label had been right. Sales were disappointing and audiences were slow to catch on because her in-your-face queer anthems were out of step with the trend for whispery, confessional pop.",
      "But those songs came to life on stage. Big, fun and designed for audience participation, they're taken to new heights by Roan's powerhouse voice and flamboyant stage persona.",
      "\"A drag queen does not get on stage to calm people down,\" she says. \"A drag queen does not say things to flatter people. A queen makes you blush, you know what I mean? Expect the same energy at my show.\"",
      "Sure enough, it was a live-streamed appearance at last year's Coachella Festival that pushed her into the upper echelons of pop.",
      "Dressed in a PVC crop top that declared \"Eat Me\", she played the packed Gobi tent like a headliner, strutting purposefully across the stage and coaching the audience in the campy choreography for Hot To Go.",
      "Then she stared directly into the camera and dedicated a song to her ex.",
      "\"Bitch I know you're watching\u2026 and all those horrible things happening to you are karma.\"",
      "The clip went viral and, before long, her career did, too.",
      "By the summer, all of her shows had been upgraded. Festivals kept having to move her to bigger stages. When she played Lollapalooza in August, she drew the event's biggest ever daytime crowd.",
      "\"It just takes a decade,\" she says. \"That's what I tell everyone. 'If you're OK with it taking 10 years, then you're good'.\"",
      "As fans discovered her debut album, Roan also released a standalone single - a sarcastic slice of synth-pop called Good Luck Babe, which became her breakout hit.",
      "\"I don't even know if I've ever said this in an interview, but it was originally called Good Luck, Jane,\" she reveals.",
      "\"I wanted it to be about me falling in love with my best friend, and then her being like, 'Ha ha ha, I don't like you back, I like boys.'",
      "\"And it was like, 'OK, well, good luck with that, Jane'.\"",
      "A masterclass in pop storytelling, Good Luck Babe has a proper three-act structure, with a killer pay-off in the middle eight and a chorus you just can't shake.",
      "Still, Roan was shocked by its success.",
      "\"I just threw it out, like, I don't know what this is going to do \u2013 and it carried the whole year!\"",
      "The question, of course, is what the star does next, now that she's the Sound of 2025.",
      "She's already previewed two new songs, The Subway and The Giver, in concert \u2013 but all she will reveal about a second album is that she's \"more reluctant to be sad or dark\".",
      "\"It feels so good to party,\" she explains.",
      "Looking back at the last 12 months, she's philosophical about what it means to be pop's hottest new commodity.",
      "\"A lot of people think fame is the pinnacle of success, because what more could you possibly want than adoration?\"",
      "Roan does admit that the admiration of strangers is more \"addictive\" than she'd expected.",
      "\"Like, I understand why I'm so scared to lose this feeling.",
      "\"It's so scary to think that one day people will not care about you the same way as they do right now - and I think [that idea] lives in women's brains a lot different than men's.\"",
      "Ultimately, she decides, success and failure are \"out of my control\". Instead, she wants to make good choices.",
      "\"If I can look back and say, 'I did not crumble under the weight of expectation, and I did not stand for being abused or blackmailed', [then] at least I stayed true to my heart,\" she says.",
      "\"Like I said before, there are always options.\"",

    "summary": "The BBC spoke to officials from both sides of the talks to piece together how the Gaza deal was done.",
    "story": [
      "The Israeli and Hamas negotiators never came face to face - but by the end, just one floor separated them.",
      "Ceasefire talks via middlemen from Qatar, Egypt and the US dragged on for several months, at times without hope. Now the key players were all inside one building in Doha and the pace was frantic.",
      "A deal was close but things had gone wrong before: one source described a last-minute push to stop the agreement breaking down while a podium was being set up so the Qatari prime minister could announce it.",
      "\"Literally, negotiations were up until 10 minutes before the press conference. So that's how things were stitched up at the last minute,\" the source familiar with the talks said.",
      "The BBC has spoken to a number of officials on all sides of the negotiations to piece together how the final fraught days of the secretive process unfolded.",
      "Shifting ground",
      "The deal did not come out of the blue.",
      "The overall framework of the agreement reached on 15 January was broadly the same as the proposal set out by President Joe Biden during a White House address last May. It uses the same three-phase approach and will see a ceasefire, Israeli hostages released in return for Palestinian prisoners, and the Israeli military's gradual withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "But sources familiar with the discussions agreed the dynamics of the talks shifted decisively in mid-December and the pace changed.",
      "Hamas, already reeling from Israel's killing of its leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza two months earlier, had become increasingly isolated. Its Lebanon-based ally Hezbollah had been decimated and had agreed to a truce with Israel. Bashar al-Assad's Iran-backed government in Syria had also been swept away.",
      "The view in Washington is that Hamas was forced to abandon the idea that \"the cavalry was coming to save it\", as one US official put it.",
      "\"It is hard to overstate how fundamentally the equation changed and what that [did] for Hamas's calculus,\" says a senior Biden administration official familiar with the talks.",
      "An Israeli official who wished to remain anonymous said Hamas was \"not in a rush\" to strike a deal and had been \"dictating\" rather than negotiating. They said that changed after the death of Sinwar and Israeli operations against Hamas's allies in the region.",
      "On top of that, the official said, there was \"momentum created by both US administrations\" - the Biden White House and the incoming Trump team.",
      "\"We could not achieve a deal like this until conditions had changed,\" the official added.",
      "On 12 December, Biden's negotiating team visited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Middle East envoy Brett McGurk and CIA director Bill Burns were all in attendance.",
      "A US official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the meeting lasted \"multiple hours\" and focused on the \"new regional equation\" and \"how we catapult from the Lebanon ceasefire into another round of intensive discussions\" on Gaza.",

      "There was also another piece on the chessboard by this stage: Donald Trump.",
      "On 16 December, weeks after Trump's victory, the BBC spoke to a Hamas official who was unusually optimistic about the ceasefire efforts, suggesting they seemed to be more serious.",
      "The official - who had taken part in every set of talks since November 2023 - appeared reassured by the fact that an adviser to the incoming US president had sent a message to mediators indicating Trump wanted an agreement before his inauguration.",
      "Trump had also warned of \"all hell to pay\" if Hamas did not agree to release the hostages - but the Palestinian official was bullish.",
      "\"This time, the pressure will not be limited to Hamas, as was customary under the Biden administration,\" the official said. \"There will also be pressure on Netanyahu. He is the one obstructing the deal, and Trump seems to understand that very well.\"",
      "False dawns",
      "However, that same official's prediction that a deal could be done by Christmas proved to be optimistic.",
      "During December, the process remained beset by problems. Israel publicly ruled out releasing certain high-profile prisoners, while the White House accused Hamas of throwing up roadblocks over the hostage releases.",
      "A Biden administration official said: \"Hamas [was] refusing to agree - and this was a breakdown at that point - to the list of hostages that would be released in phase one of the deal.",
      "\"That's just so fundamental. This is a hostage release deal. Unless you agree to the list of hostages who will come out, there's not going to be a deal.\"",
      "The same official said Hamas made \"completely untrue\" claims about not knowing the location of the hostages, and added: \"We held the line and basically left the table until Hamas agreed to the hostage list.\"",
      "An anonymous Israeli official said Hamas had sought to conceal the number of living hostages and \"tried to dictate that they would send us only dead bodies\".",
      "For its part, Hamas claimed Israel unexpectedly added 11 names to the list of hostages it wanted to be released in the first phase. Hamas considered them reserve soldiers, and therefore not eligible to be released alongside the women, injured and elderly hostages due to be released in phase one.",
      "The door was left open to Qatari and Egyptian mediators to continue their efforts and on 3 January, there was an apparent breakthrough when Hamas proposed the release of 110 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in return.",
      "There were by now well-established terms of reference for such trades. For each hostage Hamas was to release, Israel would have to provide what had become known in the nomenclature of the draft deal as a \"key\" - meaning an agreed number or even specific identities of Palestinian prisoners.",
      "A US official said: \"There's an equation for how many Palestinian prisoners come out. So for female soldiers, for example, there's a key. And for elderly males, there's a key. And for women civilians, there's a key. And this has all been worked out and the prisoners have been named, hundreds and hundreds of prisoners on the list.\"",
      "The exchange file in the negotiations - Palestinian prisoners for hostages held by Hamas - became known as \"the keys\".",
      "During this phase of the talks, Hamas also relented on two long-standing demands: the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza in the first phase and a formal Israeli commitment to a total ceasefire.",
      "Sensing a breakthrough, the Egyptian mediator urgently dispatched Major General Ahmed Abdel Khaleq - who oversees the Palestinian portfolio in Egyptian intelligence - to Doha. After meeting with Hamas representatives, he secured confirmation the group would make what a senior Hamas official described as \"painful concessions.\"",
      "But on 6 January, according to a Palestinian official, Israel rejected the offer put forward by Hamas on the 11 hostages. Hamas responded by sending the BBC and other media outlets a list featuring the names and ages of 34 Israeli hostages. Two days later, the body of one of those on that list - Yosef\u00a0AlZayadni - was found inside Gaza.",
      "The list included reserve soldiers, which indicated Hamas was willing to release them in the first phase.",
      "This appeared to be an attempt to embarrass Netanyahu and rally hostage families in Israel and around the world to pressure him into accepting the deal.",
      "It was also an indication Hamas had not walked away.",
      "Metres apart",
      "Meetings stretching into the small hours of Doha's hot evenings became common during the final stretch of the negotiations.",
      "In the last month, they had developed into so-called \"proximity talks\", with both sides in the same two-storey building, according to multiple accounts from officials familiar with the details.",
      "A senior US official said Hamas's delegation was on the first floor and Israel's on the floor above. Mediators ran pieces of paper between them. Maps of Israeli troop withdrawal proposals and details about hostages or prisoners drafted for release were shuttled back and forth.",
      "\"That takes an enormous amount of work and, I have to say, all of that was not fully nailed down, really, until just the [final] hours,\" said the official.",
      "Inside the building, the delegations met separately with senior figures from Qatar and Egypt. Among those closely involved in the details was Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.",
      "Two crucial areas were worked on in the final phases of the talks: the lists for release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and the positions for Israeli troop withdrawals from populated areas in Gaza during phase one.",
      "By 9 January, the pressure had escalated. Trump's envoy, Biden's envoy, and the Egyptian intelligence chief convened in Doha for a serious eight-hour negotiation session.",
      "A senior Egyptian official told the BBC: \"We are at the closest point to reaching an agreement.\"",
      "Agreement had been reached on 90% of the outstanding issues, but further talks were required.",
      "Steve Witkoff, Trump's recently appointed Middle East envoy, was dispatched to Tel Aviv to meet Netanyahu. Though not yet officially in post, the New York property tycoon had become more and more involved in the talks, which Trump was taking a keen interest in.",
      "He was about to be sent on an assignment that proved to be pivotal.",
      "End game",

      "Witkoff was asked to wait until the sabbath had ended before he met Netanyahu but, in a breach of custom, the envoy refused and demanded to meet the prime minister immediately.",
      "Netanyahu appears to have come under serious strong-arming during the meeting and the intervention from the Trump camp to get the Israeli government to set aside its final reservations seems to have been critical.",
      "The meeting was reportedly fractious and the message to Netanyahu from the incoming president was clear: Trump wants a deal - now get it done.",
      "Commenting on those talks, an Israeli official who asked to remain anonymous said it was a \"very important meeting\".",

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 01:41:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Mzwandile Mkwayi volunteered to go down into the shaft to help save the lives of scores of South African miners.",
    "story": [
      "This story contains details, including a video, that some people may find distressing.",
      "As Mzwandile Mkwayi was lowered into the South African mine in a red metal cage attached to a hoist above ground, the first thing that struck him was the smell.",
      "\"Let me tell you something,\" he tells the BBC, \"those bodies really smelled bad\".",
      "When he got home later that day, he told his wife he could not eat the meat she had cooked.",
      "\"It's because when I spoke to the miners, they told me some of them had to eat other [people] inside the mine because there was no way they could find food. And they were also eating cockroaches,\" he said on a phone call from his home.",
      "Allegations that the miners resorted to eating human flesh in order to survive were also made by other miners who were rescued in December, in statements submitted to the high court.",
      "Mkwayi, a former convict, known locally as Shasha, lives in the township of Khuma that was close to the disused mine in Stilfontein. The 36-year-old, who had served seven years in prison for robbery, volunteered to go down to help with the rescue effort.",
      "\"I'm being rehabilitated by the correctional services and I volunteered because people in our community were seeking help for their children and brothers.",
      "\"The rescue company said they didn't have anyone who wanted to go down. So my friend Mandla and I agreed to volunteer so we could help our brothers to resurface and bring up the dead bodies.\"",
      "But even though he wanted to help, the 25-minute journey down the 2km (1.2 mile)-deep shaft filled him with terror.",
      "The crane would occasionally stop and start, leaving him dangling in the darkness. Once he got down into the mine, he was shocked by what he saw.",
      "\"There were lots of bodies, over 70 bodies, and around 200 or so people that were dehydrated.",
      "\"I felt very weak when I saw them, it was a painful thing to see. But Mandla and I decided we needed to be strong and not show them how we felt so we could motivate them.\"",
      "The miners who had been waiting for help for months, gave them a hero's welcome.",
      "\"They were very, very happy,\" he says.",
      "The miners had been stuck there following a nationwide police operation to end illicit mining at disused sites that had closed, as the industry \u2013 once the backbone of the country's economy \u2013 was shrinking.",
      "It was no longer profitable for mining multinationals to operate in many places, but the promise of still finding gold deposits was a magnet for many desperate people \u2013 particularly undocumented migrants.",
      "Thousands of shafts were abandoned.",
      "In November, police stepped up efforts at the Buffelsfontein mine in Stilfontein, surrounding the entrance to the shaft and refusing to let food and water go down.",
      "Before the rescue operation began on Monday, the local community had tried to take matters into their own hands by lowering a rope down the shaft to try and pull out some of the men.",
      "They also sent down messages and told the miners that help was coming.",
      "\"So when we got there, they were already waiting for the crane. Now when they see us, they see us as their presidents, as their messiahs: the people that came from outside into the hole to help them to resurface.\"",
      "The police say the illegal miners were always able to come out on their own but were refusing to do so because they feared arrest. But Mkwayi disagrees: \"It's a lie that people didn't want to come out. Those people were desperate for help, they were dying.\"",
      "While at the mine site on Tuesday, the BBC saw dozens of the rescued men.",
      "They appeared emaciated, their bones visible through their clothes. Some could barely walk and had to be helped by medical staff.",
      "In statements submitted to the high court, the illegal miners describe in graphic details the slow and painful death of their peers. They say many died of starvation.",
      "\"From September through October 2024, the absence of even basic sustenance was absolute, and survival became a daily battle against starvation,\" one miner was recorded as saying.",
      "Mkwayi says the men he rescued were so frail that the rescue cage that is only meant to carry seven healthy adults could take 13 of them.",
      "\"They were very dehydrated and had lost weight so we managed to fit more into the cage, because they wouldn't have survived another two days down in the hole. They would be dead if we didn't get them out as soon as possible.\"",
      "The volunteers were also in charge of bringing up dead bodies.",
      "\"The rescue services gave us bags and told us to put the bodies in them and bring them up in the cage which we did with the help of some of the miners.\"",
      "The rescue operation was initially meant to last at least a week, but after just three days, the volunteers said no-one was left underground.",
      "The authorities sent a camera down the shaft to do a final sweep. They say the mine will now be permanently sealed.",
      "But the experience has deeply impacted Mkwayi.",
      "At one point during the call he asks for a question to be repeated, explaining that his hearing has been affected since going down into the mine, presumably by the pressure.",
      "But the hardest impact has been from what he witnessed.",
      "\"I have to tell you, I am traumatised. I will never forget the sight of these people for the rest of my life.\"",
      "For activists and trade unions helping the community, the death of the 87 people in the mine amounts to a \"massacre\" perpetrated by the authorities.",
      "The use of the emotive word has drawn comparisons with the shooting dead by police of 34 striking miners in Marikana, some 150km (93 miles) away from Stilfontein, in 2012.",
      "But this time no triggers were pulled. Instead it seems many of the men starved to death.",
      "The authorities reject the idea they were responsible.",
      "The government initiated the crackdown on illicit mining in December 2023 through Operation Vala Umgodi (meaning \"close the hole\" in isiZulu).",
      "The abandoned mines had been taken over by gangs, often led by former employees, which sold what was found on the black market.",
      "People were co-opted into this illicit trade, either by force or voluntarily, and made to spend months underground digging for minerals. The government says illegal mining cost South Africa's economy $3.2bn (\u00a32.6bn) in 2024 alone.",
      "As part of the police operation, entry points at various disused mines were blocked, along with food and water supplies, in a bid to flush out the illegal miners, known locally as zama zamas (which translates as \"take a chance\").",
      "While Vala Umgodi was largely successful in other provinces, the old Buffelsfontein gold mine presented a unique challenge.",
      "Prior to the police operation, most of the miners were only able to get underground through a makeshift pulley system operated by people at the surface.",
      "But they then abandoned the top of the mineshaft when security officials arrived in large numbers in August, leaving those in the mine stranded.",
      "Community members then stepped in to help, pulling a few people up using ropes, but this was a long, arduous process.",
      "Other difficult and dangerous exits were available and in all nearly 2,000 resurfaced - most were arrested and remain in police custody.",
      "Why others did not come out is not clear \u2013 they may have been too weak or were being threatened by gang members in the mine - but they were left in desperate circumstances.",
      "Out of the 87 who died, only two have been identified, police said on Thursday, explaining that the fact that many were undocumented migrants made the process harder.",
      "\"We hold the view that government has blood on its hands,\" Magnificent Mndebele from the Mining Affected Communities United in Action group (Macua), told the BBC.",
      "He argued that the miners were given no warning about what was about to happen before the police operation began.",
      "Over the past two months, Macua has been at the forefront of the various court battles initiated to compel the government to first allow supplies and then undertake a rescue operation.",
      "Its blaming of the government echoes earlier statements from families who had said that the authorities had killed their loved ones.",
      "They had taken a hard line since the operation intensified. In November, one minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, made the now infamous statement during a press briefing that they were going to \"smoke them out\".",
      "The state refused to allow food to be sent down or anyone to help retrieve the miners, only caving in after several successful court applications.",
      "In November, small portions of instant maize and water made it down the shaft, but in a court statement, one of the miners said it was not enough for the hundreds of men down below, many of whom were too weak to even chew and swallow them.",
      "More food was delivered in December, but again it could not sustain the men.",
      "Given that the operation to bring up the men and bodies lasted just three days, what is hard for Mr Mndebele to understand is why this could not have been done sooner, when it was clear there was an issue.",
      "\"We're disappointed by our government, frankly put, because this help has come too late.\"",
      "While the government is yet to formally respond to these accusations, police have vowed to continue with the wider operations to clear the country's disused mines until May this year.",
      "Speaking to journalists in Stilfontein on Tuesday, Mining Minister Gwede Mantashe was unapologetic. He said the government would intensify the fight against illegal mining, which he labelled a crime and an \"attack on the economy\".",
      "On Thursday, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu was a little more conciliatory.",
      "\"I do understand and accept that this is an emotional issue. Everyone wants to judge\u2026 but it would help all of us as South Africans to wait until pathologists have done and completed their job,\" he said.",
      "The police have defended their actions, saying providing the miners with food would have \"allowed criminality to thrive\".",
      "Illegal miners have been accused of fostering criminality in the communities where they operate.",
      "A number of stories have been published in local media linking the zama zamas to various rapes and murders.",
      "But for Mkwayi, who put his own safety on the line to help the miners, the men in the Stilfontein mine were just trying to make a living.",
      "\"People went down 2km with a rope and risked their lives to put food on the table for their families.\"",
      "He said he wants the government to give licences to artisanal miners who are forced to go into disused mines due to South Africa's high unemployment rate.",
      "\"If your children are hungry, you won't think twice about going down there because you have to feed them. You'll risk your life to put food on the table.\"",

    "summary": "As the Palisades Fire exploded in his hometown, the actor was moving abandoned cars so emergency vehicles could get through. He spoke about the importance of making a difference; and about caring for his late father, Stanley, whom he calls his \"anchor.\"",
    "story": [
      "On January 7, as the Palisades Fire exploded, a man interrupted a reporter's live shot. It was Steve Guttenberg, one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s and '90s. He had been moving cars \u2013 abandoned by people around Pacific Palisades trying to escape the encroaching fire \u2013 so that emergency vehicles could get through.",
      "\"What's happening is, people take their keys with them as if they're in a parking lot. This is not a parking lot,\" he told KTLA. \"If you leave your car behind, leave the key in there so a guy like me can move your car so that these fire trucks can get up there.\"",
      "He can't remember how he got to safety.",
      "Many days later, with much of his hometown reduced to ruins, he was still there to help protect his and his neighbors' homes. He showed me a part of Sunset that had been stacked with cars. \"Yeah, couldn't get through,\" he said. \"So, I was moving some of these cars over there. And then, a lotta these cars just didn't have keys in them. Locked.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it in you that is compelling you to stay here?\"",
      "\"You know, it's not often in life that you feel like you can make a difference,\" he replied. \"And I really feel like I can make a difference. Like, I'm able bodied, I'm strong, I have a heart, and I care. And this is what I'm supposed to do today.\"",
      "If you know Guttenberg, you know he's a helper. Seven years ago, he put everything on hold to care for someone with whom he was deeply in love: his father.",
      "I noted, \"I'm gonna try to get through this interview without crying because I lost my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg asked, \"What was your dad's name?\"",
      "\"Douglas.\"",
      "\"Hi, Douglas!\" Guttenberg said. \"You know, when you say a person's name who's passed, they come around. I believe they're not always with you, 'cause they've got other things to do. But Douglas is here, and so is Stanley, my dad.",
      "\"My dad was the greatest,\" he said. \"He was the first man who ever held me, first guy I ever looked in his eyes. And I fell in love with my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg has written a book about his journey as a caregiver for the man he calls his hero. It's called \"Time to Thank.\" \"My dad and his dad weren't close,\" he said. \"My grandfather was cold. He wasn't a kissing, hugging type of dad to my father. So, my dad was the opposite.\"",
      "A \"kissing and hugging dad\" who worked jobs that weren't exactly touchy-feely. \"He was an Airborne Army Ranger. He was a New York City policeman. He was a power lifter and a weightlifter. And he did handstands for 20 minutes.\"",
      "Guttenberg's dad was a hands-on parent, so it was to Steve's surprise that when he wanted to move to L.A., at only 17, to try to become a movie star, he was allowed to do it. \"My parents gave me $300 and said, 'You got two weeks.' And I got a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial. And my parents let me stay another two weeks. And I got a little movie [\"The Chicken Chronicles\"]. And I got more commercials. Then, I actually stayed a year, before I quit and went back to school.\"",
      "He wasn't in school for long when Hollywood beckoned him back. \"I was at a party in my suite at Albany State, and got this call from my agent. Everybody was a little \u2026 inebriated!\" he laughed. \"And my agent said, 'I got an audition for you. It was called \"Boys From Brazil.\" And it was gonna be starring Greg Peck and Larry Olivier and James Mason, Uta Hagen.'\"",
      "\"It's hard to turn that down, right?\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! I asked my dad. My dad said, 'You know, just go down and do the audition. if you get it, you'll decide. And I got the job.\"",
      "Guttenberg says it was Laurence Olivier who taught him humility, but it was his dad who helped him get his big break in a little film about a bunch of misfits joining the police force. \"I told my dad that I had a screen test coming up for this movie, 'Police Academy.' And he said, 'Oh, you should wear my police academy shirt.' I remember going to the screen test, and I was up against another actor who was really talented,. And the director said, 'Hold on here: Did you make that shirt, boy?' And I said, 'No, that's my dad's real police academy shirt.' And half a day later my agent called me and said, 'You got it.' And maybe it was because of that cadet shirt that my dad gave me.\"",
      "Guttenberg would go on to become one of the busiest actors of his generation, with more than 100 films and TV shows under his belt, including \"Diner,\" \"Three Men and a Baby, \"Cocoon,\" and \"Short Circuit.\" All the while his dad was there ready to bring him back to reality, often calling before the rest of L.A. got out of bed. Guttenberg says he never missed that 6:00 a.m. call.\u00a0 \"No, I always had to be home at six o'clock. Even if I got home at 5 to 6:00! I had to answer that phone. He was my anchor.\"",
      "So when his dad was diagnosed with kidney failure while living in Phoenix, Guttenberg got in his car, driving 400 miles every week to care for his father. \"The drive really gave me time to think, and time to thank,\" he said.",
      "Steve and his siblings even become home dialysis techs, but only he couldn't accept the inevitable. \"I gave him a hug. And something didn't sound right. And we had a nurse with us, and the nurse put a stethoscope to him. And she said, 'He's gone.' And I said, 'No!' And I started doing CPR on him. I just couldn't accept it at that moment.\"",
      "Asked when he could finally let him go, Guttenberg replied, \"I probably let him go a year later. It's hard to believe that he's gone. I still think that he's here.\"",
      "\"He is,\" I said. \"Just say his name.\"",
      "\"Stanley!\"",
      "And right now, Guttenberg thinks his father is sending along some helpful advice. \"I feel my dad's around, yeah, I really do. I feel my dad is here with me. And I think he's also saying, 'Steven, enough. Get outta there.'\"",
      "So far, his own home is standing. But Steve Guttenberg says it's time to listen to his dad. \"You know, the truth is, no matter how big your house is, no matter how much money you have, how expensive your car, at the end of it, you're walking down the street with a little suitcase of a few things that you saved, and you're looking for someone to tell you where to go.\"",

      "It was the tail end of June 1968; the air was starting to get humid. Fourth grade was ending, and I could feel the three months of delirium that was coming.",
      "And I was ready. Because I'd been collecting. I had enough fireworks to last the whole summer. I took every penny I made from my Newsday delivery route and poured them into \"belts,\" these macho configurations of 144 firecrackers. These particular belts came straight from China, with Chinese calligraphy on the wrapper, and to my young perspective, they were the ultimate asset. Better than gold.",
      "I bought belt after belt from Andy Mahoney, who was notorious in my neighborhood for lighting my neighbor's garage on fire with a chlorine bomb. He was an anti-hero, a rebel with a cause, five years older than I was. The only reason he talked with me was because I was buying from him.",
      "Initially I kept all that gunpowder in the ingenious hideaway I'd devised: the side drawer of my desk. By some miracle, my mother never found them. But they couldn't just sit in that drawer forever; I had to see if they would work.",
      "So I decided to get a pack of matches, lock myself in the family bathroom, and throw lit firecrackers out the only window. My father was down in the den, my mother in the kitchen. How could I possibly get caught? I proceeded to create my own personal preview of the Fourth of July.",
      "And wouldn't you know it? Someone noticed.",
      "\"What the hell is going on?\" I heard my mother say downstairs. \"Stanley, I smell smoke.\"",
      "\"Check the air conditioners,\" my father said. \"I'm going to look at the attic.\"",
      "I heard my father's footsteps as he rushed up to the attic, praying that he would skip past the bathroom I'd turned into my private gunpowder studio. But then he started banging on the door.",
      "\"Steven? What the hell are you doing in there?\"",
      "\"Nothing,\" I said, my voice extremely calm.",
      "I dropped another lit belt out the window.",
      "\"Open this door, now!\"",
      "I looked around the family bathroom: Where could I hide these suckers? Where could I hide myself? Nowhere seemed promising. So, after a moment, I opened the door.",
      "A plume of smoke billowed out into the rest of the house. I was covered in soot. My father looked me over, and as he stood there for what felt like a very long time, I was sure he was going to hand me my head. And not on a platter.",
      "\"I'll tell you what I'm going to do,\" he said. I started to sweat. \"How many firecrackers do you have?\"",
      "I went to my trusty desk drawer and slid it open. He was the only human to ever see that cache\u2014other than Andy Mahoney.",
      "\"That's a lot of gunpowder. How did you get all these firecrackers?\"",
      "\"They're called belts, Dad,\" I said. He raised his eyebrows\u2014not the right answer. \"I got them using my newspaper route money.\"",
      "He reached into the drawer and, with one giant hand, grabbed the bulk of them.",
      "\"Follow me.\"",
      "We headed outside. I was sure that we were going to the garbage pails, but he walked right past them.",
      "\"You and me are going to light every firecracker in these belts and finish them off.\"",
      "I was going to light firecrackers with my father? These were contraband, but he\u2014an ex-cop\u2014was willing to put himself in harm's way for me? That's a dad. That's a father.",
      "We stood on the patio, and as the sun started to set, we handed each other single cylinders of gunpowder. My father had his Zippo lighter\u2014he lit each one carefully and then threw it onto the lawn. Pow! Bang! My dad was lighting firecrackers, and it made me delirious. I carefully twisted a cracker off the belt, handed it to my dad, barrel first, and within seconds it had exploded into a green cloud of smithereens.",
      "Then my father started to get creative\u2014he'd light the firecrackers and then throw them high so they'd explode in mid-air, nipping the edge of the mimosa tree. After a time, he turned to me.",
      "\"Here, you light some,\" he said. \"I've got an extra Zippo.\"",
      "I started slow, lighting the wick and then running as I dropped them on the ground. But I saw my father's confidence and started to throw them onto the lawn too. Dad threw one. I threw one. Our explosions echoing one another: call and response, question and answer.",
      "\"What the hell are you two doing?\" my mother said, her head halfway out the bedroom window.",
      "\"We're lighting firecrackers, Ann. My partner and me.\"",
      "His partner. Dad called me his partner. It was like I'd joined the Yankees and the Mets all at once.",
      "There we stood, for hours, as the sun set over the mimosa tree. I looked up at my dad: my hero, my partner. We lit every last one. Of course, one blew up between my fingers; the pain was spectacular, but I didn't dare tell. This was too good.",
      "It was dark as we lit the last few. They unwrapped and exploded in the air, illuminating the backyard with blasts of light.",
      "\"That's it, Steven. We're done. Good job.\"",
      "I walked back into the house a little changed. A little more trust from my dad. A little bit more like a man.",

    "title": "Tamara de Lempicka's vibrant life and art",
    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 09:26:12 -0500",
    "summary": "A giant of early 20th century art, whose glamorous figurative paintings of women played an important role in defining Art Deco, is now the subject of her first-ever U.S. retrospective, currently at the de Young Museum of San Francisco.",
    "story": [
      "When you see a painting by Tamara de Lempicka, it's hard to resist leaning in for a closer look. \"It's just exquisite,\" said Furio Rinaldi, one of the curators of the first-ever Lempicka retrospective in the United States. \"You don't see the brush strokes. They are just polished and incredibly deliberate. It's such a clean way of painting.\"",
      "These glamorous Art Deco works are now on display at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. [The exhibit travels to Houston this spring.]",
      "So, what makes a painting so characteristically Lempicka?",
      "\"Geometrical shapes,\" said Rinaldi. \"Everything is reduced to essential forms. And the other aspect of Lempicka is that she sourced directly from examples provided by the European Old Masters. So, all these things blended together create a language that not only is entirely unique, but entirely modern.\"",
      "Born in 1894 in Poland as Tamara Rosa Hurwitz, Tamara eventually moved to St. Petersburg, marrying an aristocratic lawyer, Tadeusz \u0141empicki Junosza. In 1917, the Russian Revolution forced the couple and their young daughter to flee to Paris. \"Paris was just recovering from the end of the first war,\" said Rinaldi. \"And there was a sense of hope for the future, and kind of a great faith for what was to come.\"",
      "In Paris, she began to paint, first out of financial necessity, using the name Lempicka.",
      "Rinaldi said, \"She captured that very exciting moment of empowerment and emancipation for the queer community in Paris.\"",
      "Some of the women she painted were her lovers. \"The female body is not concealed or corseted as it was before in the previous decade,\" said Rinaldi. \"It's celebrated in its shape.\"",
      "He described a painting of her lover, the poet Ira Perrot: \"Eroticism with a sitter who's not even looking at us. She's just living in her own world. She has this gaze that is detached and completely cool.\"",
      "Each time Lempicka sold a painting, she made a purchase of her own: a diamond bracelet. According to Marisa de Lempicka, the artist's great-granddaughter, it was for protection: \"If she ever had to flee again, she could carry the bracelets with her. She could survive again.\"",
      "\"She always had to think about saving herself?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, herself and her family.\"",
      "Indeed, her fears were well-founded. In 1939, before the outbreak of World War II, Lempicka and her second husband, a Jewish baron, fled Europe for the United States. She continued painting another four decades, until her death in 1980.",
      "Asked if her great-grandmother had a sense of her legacy at the end of her life, Marisa de Lempicka replied, \"She was the toast of the town in the Twenties and Thirties in Paris. She was extremely well-known. And then, she moved to the United States and, you know, the tastes changed. Abstract expressionism is in fashion, so she kind of falls out of favor.\"",
      "\"Why do you think we haven't known her name and her story?\"",
      "\"I think the fact she's a woman artist,\" Marisa said. \"How many women artists can we name? You go to the general public? Very, very few.\"",
      "But Lempicka is now back in the public eye. Last year, she was the subject of a Broadway show, and her works continue to sell for millions of dollars. Collectors include Barbra Streisand and Madonna, who's even featured Lempicka's paintings in music videos.",
      "Asked what she wants the public to know about Tamara de Lempicka, Marisa replied, \"I hope people see her art, learn about her life, and feel empowered and inspired to live their own life and their own dreams. I know this is what Tamara would have wanted.\"",

    "title": "If TikTok goes, so will livelihoods: \"We'd have to completely rebuild\"",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:09:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say no other app offers the same financial opportunities as TikTok, while creators fear loss of income if it disappears.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

    "summary": "Justin Baldoni's lawsuit comes after \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively accused him of sexual harassment.",
    "story": [
      "Justin Baldoni filed a counter lawsuit against \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, on Thursday, alleging the couple hijacked his film and sought to destroy his livelihood and career.",
      "In the lawsuit's 179-page complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, Baldoni accuses Lively and Reynolds of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "The lawsuit, which also named Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, and her firm Vision PR Inc., comes shortly after Baldoni filed a separate defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which first reported Lively's allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni during the film's production.",
      "Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath and two others are also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds. They're seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "A spokesperson from Lively's legal team said Baldoni's counterclaim is a typical tactic abusers use to discredit victims by turning the tables on them. The spokesperson said the DARVO claim \u2014 deny, attack, reverse victim offender \u2014 is a well-documented method often discussed during the Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard trials.",
      "\"They are trying to shift the narrative to Ms. Lively by falsely claiming that she seized creative control and alienated the cast from Mr. Baldoni,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"The evidence will show that the cast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer. The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony's cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\"",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney representing Baldoni, told CBS News in a statement the lawsuit details alleged evidence that Lively disseminated \"grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.\"",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret,\" Freedman said.",
      "Lively in December came forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni, who also directed and co-financed the film adaption of the 2016\u00a0Colleen Hoover\u00a0novel that explores domestic violence and emotional abuse.",
      "Lively's complaint against Baldoni, Heath and Wayfarer Studios, originally reported by The New York Times, included accusations that, after a meeting in which she and Reynolds addressed alleged \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "\"The allegations against The New York Times in this new lawsuit are meritless and recycled from the equally baseless claims in the suit that was filed against The Times in California,\" a spokesperson for The New York Times said in a statement.",
      "According to The New York Times, Lively's lawsuit also included texts allegedly sent by Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, to crisis PR specialist Melissa Nathan, both of whom are named as plaintiffs in Baldoni's lawsuit, which say the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and, \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "In Baldoni's countersuit, he claimed that his former publicist, Stephanie Jones, was \"filled with impotent rage\" at him and Abel, who left Jones' company Jonesworks to form her own firm and work for Baldoni.",
      "In turn, Baldoni's lawsuit alleges, Jones colluded with Lively, Reynolds and Sloane to seize Abel's phone and \"mine it for messages that, stripped of context, could be used to concoct a false narrative\" to make it appear that Baldoni was behind negative press coverage and public reactions to Lively.",
      "The new lawsuit says the plaintiffs did not want to file the suit, but that Lively \"has unequivocally left them with no choice, not only to set the record straight in response to Lively's accusations, but also to put the spotlight on the parts of Hollywood that they have dedicated their careers to being the antithesis of.\"",
      "An email seeking comment from Sloane, whose PR company represents both Lively and Reynolds, was not immediately answered.",
      "The two actors are also represented by the WME agency, which dropped Baldoni as a client after Lively filed a legal complaint that was a precursor to her lawsuit, and the Times published its story on the fight surrounding the film.",
      "The surprise hit film has made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",

      "From the 1950s to the 1980s, Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" to William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice.\" She stunned in Eugene Ionesco's \"The Chairs,\" and George Bernard Shaw's totemic two female roles \"Major Barbara\" and \"Saint Joan.\"",
      "\"I've been very privileged to have such a life,\" Plowright said in a 2010 interview with\u00a0The Actor's Work. \"I mean it's magic and I still feel, when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there's no curtain, the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me.\"",
      "The esteem in which Plowright was held in London was evident with the news that theaters across the West End will dim their lights for two minutes at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in her honor.",
      "Born Joan Ann Plowright in Brigg, Lincolnshire, England, her mother ran an amateur drama group and Plowright was involved in the theater from age 3. She was soon spending school vacations at summer sessions of university drama schools. After high school, she studied at the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Manchester, then won a two-year scholarship to the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London.",
      "Following her London stage debut in 1954, Plowright became a member of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956 and gained recognition in dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men, such as John Osborne, who were giving British theater a thorough airing-out. The new, rough-hewn, working-class actors like Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.",
      "Plowright made her feature film debut with an uncredited turn in American director John Huston's epic adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" in 1956, starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab.",
      "A year later, she co-starred with her future husband Olivier in the original London production of Osborne's \"The Entertainer.\" She played Olivier's daughter in the work and the two reunited for the 1960 film adaptation.",
      "By then, Plowright's marriage to British actor Roger Cage had ended, as had Olivier's 20-year union with Vivien Leigh. Plowright and Olivier were married in Connecticut in 1961, while both were starring on Broadway, he in \"Becket\" and she in \"A Taste of Honey,\" for which she won a Tony.",
      "One love letter Olivier sent summed up his love: \"I sometimes feel such a peacefulness come over me when I think of you, or write to you \u2014 a gentle tenderness and serenity. A feeling devoid of all violence, passion or shattering longing... it makes me go out into the street with a smile on my face and in my heart for everybody.\"",
      "Olivier died in 1989 at the age of 82. After that, Plowright enjoyed a career resurgence at the age of 60, satisfying both upmarket tastes and more commercial fare.",
      "She was in Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" in 1996 and the Merchant-Ivory production of \"Surviving Picasso,\" as well as starring as the stalwart nanny in Disney's live-action remake of \"101 Dalmatians\" in 1996 with Glenn Close.",
      "She starred opposite Walter Matthau in the big screen adaptation of the classic comic strip \"Dennis the Menace,\" and made a brief appearance in the Arnold Schwarzenegger self-referencing satire \"Last Action Hero\" in 1993.",
      "Plowright became one of only a handful of actors to win two Golden Globes in the same year, in 1993, when she won the supporting actress TV award for \"Stalin\" and the supporting actress movie award for \"Enchanted April.\" For the latter, which told the story of a group of Britons finding their lives transformed on a vacation to Italy, she received her sole nomination for an Academy Award.",
      "Not all her works were career roses, as with the disastrous \"The Scarlet Letter\" starring Demi Moore and a pilot that went nowhere for a TV series based on \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" An appearance alongside Chevy Chase in the 2011 holiday family comedy \"Goose on the Loose\" didn't rouse critics.",
      "A prominent role in later life was keeper of the Olivier flame \u2014 bestowing awards, defending her husband in the press and curating his letters.",
      "\"That is my choice because I was privileged to live with him,\" she told The Daily Telegraph in 2003. \"When someone who has had such fame and idolatry and worship goes, then there's bound to be a backlash which comes the other way and you get a bit sick of that. Mine was really trying to put things straight.\"",
      "Plowright is survived by her three children \u2014 Tamsin, Richard and Julie-Kate, all actors, and several grandchildren.",

      "David Lynch, the groundbreaking director of films and shows including \"Twin Peaks\" and \"Blue Velvet,\" has died at the age of 78, his family announced Thursday.",
      "\"It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch,\" a statement posted to Lynch's social media reads. \"We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There's a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.' It's a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.\"",
      "Lynch, who would have turned 79 on Monday, revealed in August 2024 that he was diagnosed with emphysema, a chronic lung disease, after years of smoking.",
      "Lynch, who was born in Montana in 1946, was a writer, director and painter who studied at the American Film Institute. He first broke into the movie scene in 1977 when he turned his thesis project into his first feature film \"Eraserhead,\" a black-and-white surrealist indie film that quickly gained notoriety as a midnight movie.",
      "\"Eraserhead\" attracted the attention of producer Mel Brooks, who brought Lynch aboard to direct \"The Elephant Man,\" an adaptation of the life and times of the severely deformed Joseph Merrick, telling the younger director, \"You're a crazy man. You're hired.\"",
      "\"The Elephant Man\" earned Lynch his first of three Academy Award nominations for best director, followed by \"Blue Velvet\" in 1986 and \"Mulholland Drive\" in 2001, the latter also earning Lynch a best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival, where he previously earned the festival's top prize \u2014 the Palme d'Or \u2014 for 1990's \"Wild at Heart.\"",
      "Lynch also directed the ill-fated 1984 movie adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel \"Dune.\"",
      "But for many, Lynch's most famous contribution to pop culture was his collaboration with Mark Frost on ABC's primetime drama \"Twin Peaks,\"\u00a0 which hooked viewers immediately with its sui generis combination of mystery and quirk, spurring legions to tune in weekly to find out who murdered Laura Palmer, who was played by Sheryl Lee.",
      "The show initially lasted only two seasons in the early '90s and took home three Golden Globe honors in 1991, including Best TV Series and Best Actor for Kyle MacLachlan. In 2017, the show was revisited to widespread critical acclaim in the Showtime limited series \"Twin Peaks: The Return.\"",
      "The style of his films coined the term \"Lynchian,\" referring to the juxtaposition of \"surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments.\"",
      "In 2019, Lynch received an honorary Academy Award at the Motion Picture Academy's Governors Awards, and in 2012, he received honorary degrees from the American Film Institute.",

      "On Wednesday, the President-elect announced on his social media site that the three actors would be his eyes and ears to the moviemaking town.",
      "\"It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "He also called the trio special envoys. Special ambassadors and envoys are typically chosen to respond to troubled hot spots like the Middle East, not California.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Thursday, Gibson said he \"got the tweet at the same time as all of you and was just as surprised. Nevertheless, I heed the call. My duty as a citizen is to give any help and insight I can. Any chance the position comes with an Ambassador's residence?\"",
      "Gibson's Malibu home was destroyed in the wildfires which scorched the Los Angeles area.",
      "U.S. film and television production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and, in the past week, the ongoing wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Overall production in the U.S. was down 26% from 2021, according to data from ProdPro.",
      "In the greater L.A. area, productions were down 5.6% from 2023 according to FilmLA, the lowest since 2020. This past October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed expanding California's Film & Television Tax Credit program to $750 million annually, up from $330 million.

      "Trump's decision to select the actors as his chosen \"ambassadors\" underscores his preoccupations with the 1980s and '90s, when he was a rising tabloid star in New York, and Gibson and Stallone were among the biggest movie stars in the world.",
      "Stallone is a frequent guest at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club and introduced him at a gala in November shortly after the election.",

    "summary": "Bob Uecker was the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame.",
    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died, the baseball commissioner's office confirmed to CBS News. He was 90.",
      "The Brewers announced Uecker died Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most difficult days in Milwaukee Brewers history.\" In a statement released by the club, Uecker's family said he had battled small cell lung cancer since early 2023.",
      "\"Even in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter,\" the family said.",
      "Uecker was best known as a colorful comedian and broadcaster who earned his nickname during one of his numerous appearances on Johnny Carson's late night show.",
      "Born and raised in Milwaukee, Uecker was a beloved member of the baseball community and a pillar of the sport in Wisconsin.",
      "When the Brewers clinched the NL Central title in 2024, manager Pat Murphy threw an arm around Uecker in the locker room, pulling him in tight as players white-knuckled their corks, ready to shower \"Mr. Baseball\" in Champagne.",
      "\"There is no one \u2014   there is no one \u2014   who epitomizes a champion the way this man does right here,\" Murphy proclaimed as the players chanted \"UUUUUECK.\"",
      "\"What an example for us to be with every single day \u2014   Bob Uecker.\"",
      "Uecker signed his first professional contract with the Milwaukee Braves in 1956 and reached the majors in 1962. He'd last six seasons in the big leagues as a backup catcher, finishing with a .200 average and 14 homers.",
      "He won a World Series ring with St. Louis in 1964 and also played for Atlanta and Philadelphia.",
      "\"Career highlights? I had two,\" he often joked. \"I got an intentional walk from Sandy Koufax and I got out of a rundown against the Mets.\"",
      "Uecker also befriended former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who initially hired him as a scout. Selig liked to joke about how Uecker's initial scouting report was stained with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
      "Selig eventually brought Uecker to the broadcast booth. Uecker became the voice of the Brewers in 1971, in the second year after the team moved from Seattle.",
      "Uecker remained with the club from that point on and became one of the Brewers' most indelible figures. Brewers manager Craig Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area and remembered spending summer days throwing a baseball against the roof and catching it while listening to Uecker's broadcasts.",
      "\"There's no single person in this franchise's history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,\" said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers' broadcast team since 2015.",
      "Even as his celebrity status grew nationwide, Uecker savored the opportunity to continue calling games to fans in his hometown.",
      "\"To be able to do a game each and every day throughout the summer and talk to people every day at 6:30 for a night game, you become part of people's families,\" Uecker once said. \"I know that because I get mail from people that tell me that. That's part of the reward for being here, just to be recognized by the way you talk, the way you describe a game, whatever.\"",
      "Uecker was honored by the Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2003 and spent nearly 20 minutes keeping the Cooperstown, New York, crowd of about 18,000 in stitches.",
      "\"I still \u2014 and this is not sour grapes by any means \u2014   still think I should have gone in as a player,\" he quipped.",
      "\"Ueck\" got his big break off the field after opening for Don Rickles at Al Hirt's nightclub in Atlanta in 1969. That performance caught Hirt's attention, and the musician set him up to appear on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson. He became one of Carson's favorite guests, making more than 100 appearances.",
      "Carson was the one who dubbed Uecker \"Mr. Baseball.\" And the name stuck.",
      "But Uecker's comedy was just a part of his abilities. His warm storytelling and delivery made Uecker a natural to become one of the first color commentators on network TV broadcasts in the 1970s with ABC. In the '90s, he teamed up with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan for the World Series.",
      "From there, Uecker reached most households as one of the Miller Lite All-Stars in popular commercials for the beer brand based out of Milwaukee and Uecker later launched his TV acting career in 1985 on the ABC sitcom \"Mr. Belvedere.\"",
      "Uecker played George Owens during the successful 122-episode run of the series that lasted six years, as the head of the family and sports writer in a home that brings in a butler who struggles to adapt to an American household.",
      "In a bit of casting that kept things pretty close to home, Uecker also played a prominent role in the movies Major League (1989) and Major League II (1994) as crass announcer Harry Doyle for a down-and-out Cleveland Indians franchise that finds a way to become playoff contenders.",
      "\"I'm part of American folklore, I guess,\" Uecker told The Associated Press in 2003. \"But I'm not a Hollywood guy. Baseball and broadcasting are in my blood.\"",
      "His wry description of a badly wayward pitch \u2014   \"Juuuust a bit outside!\" \u2014   in the movie is still often-repeated by announcers and fans at ballparks all over.",
      "Uecker's acting left some to believe he was more about being funny than a serious baseball announcer, but his tenure and observations with the Brewers were spot on, especially when games were tight. Equally enjoyable were games that weren't, when Uecker would tell stories about other major leaguers, his own career and his hobbies as an avid fisherman and golfer.",
      "\"I don't think anyone wants to hear somebody screwing around when you got a good game going,\" Uecker said. \"I think people see 'Major League' and they think Harry Doyle and figure that's what Bob Uecker does. I do that sometimes, I do. But when we've got a good game going, I don't mess around.\"",
      "In his later years, he took a serious approach to his health, swimming daily leading up to heart surgery in April 2010. Very soon after the procedures, doctors said Uecker returned to walking several miles and was ahead in recovery.",
      "Uecker pushed to return to the booth and began calling games again in July, saying he bribed the doctors by allowing them to throw out the first pitch.",
      "\"You talk about all the things Bob has done, he never wanted to leave Milwaukee,\" Selig said. \"Above all, he made himself into a great play-by-play announcer. That's what he did. He's everything to this franchise and loves every minute of it.\"",
      "Uecker's own career provided him most of his material. His former teammates said Uecker would do impressions of other broadcasters on the bus, but Uecker turned the spotlight on himself after his playing career was over.",
      "\"I signed with the Milwaukee Braves for $3,000. That bothered my dad at the time because he didn't have that kind of dough,\" he said. \"But he eventually scraped it up.\"",
      "Another classic: \"When I came up to bat with three men on and two outs in the ninth, I looked in the other team's dugout and they were already in street clothes.\"",
      "Uecker also presided over the stirring ceremony that closed Milwaukee County Stadium in 2000. When the Brewers' new stadium opened as Miller Park in 2001, the team began selling \"Uecker Seats\" high in the upper deck and obstructed for a $1.",
      "The stadium, now known as American Family Field, has two statues in Uecker's honor. There's a statue outside the stadium and another one in the back of Section 422, a nod to the Miller Lite commercial in which he famously said \"I must be in the front row!\" while getting taken to one of the worst seats in the ballpark.",

      "Attorneys for the Biden administration said Friday they would seek to challenge a court loss last year that could pave the way for the Trump administration to ban the use of fluoride in water.",
      "The Biden administration's notice, filed Friday with the federal district court in San Francisco, comes just days ahead of a Jan. 21 deadline for the appeal.",
      "While last year's ruling did not order the Environmental Protection Agency to ban water fluoridation, opponents say it carved out a \"clear legal pathway\" giving the federal government authority to force local governments to stop adding the chemical to the water supply.",
      "Public health experts have long defended fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. The American Dental Association said last year that research shows it is a \"safe, beneficial and cost-effective public health measure\" for preventing cavities.",
      "District Court Judge Edward Chen ruled last year that evidence showed fluoride was \"hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" but stopped short of ordering the EPA to ban the practice.",
      "The judge said he only had the authority under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, to direct the EPA to take action against the risk, but not to prescribe the specifics of its response, which could range from a national warning to an outright ban.",
      "\"I'm hopeful that the new administration will use the authority that it has under TSCA to follow the lead of Europe and to implement a nationwide ban on water fluoridation,\" Michael Connett, an attorney for the groups Fluoride Action Network and Food & Water Watch that had sued the EPA, told CBS News.",
      "Attorneys for the federal government did not say what they plan to argue in its appeal. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment on the filing.",
      "It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide whether to continue the appeal.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, has advocated for removing fluoride from public water supplies and said last year that Trump intends to call for an end to fluoridation.",
      "Trump has said he was open to the idea but has not yet detailed plans. A spokesperson for the president-elect did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"If the new administration did want to take a different course with respect to fluoridation policies, it has unquestionably the authority to stand down on this appeal, and to initiate rulemaking proceeding to address the risk of fluoridation,\" said Connett.",
      "The court ruling in September stemmed in large part from a review published by the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program, which concluded that \"higher levels of fluoride exposure\" are associated with lower IQ in children.",
      "While those concerning levels are higher than what is typically added to the U.S. water supply, some opponents worry that the varied ways children consume drinks and food made with fluoridated water could add up to exposure that is too high for many kids.",

      "\"Abbott's representations of its toddler nutrition products are accurate, and our claims are well-supported,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Sales of toddler milk nationwide have averaged more than $500 million a year, according to PHAI's suit, filed in U.S. district court for the Northern District of Illinois.",
      "\"More than just unnecessary, toddler milk products can actually be harmful to a child's nutritional health,\" said George Fuchs, a medical doctor and professor of pediatric gastroenterology at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine Department of Pediatrics. \"The added sugars can increase a toddler's preference for sweetened foods, contributing to obesity and other health risks throughout their lives,\" noted Fuchs, who led the AAP report on toddler milks.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:14:24 -0500",
    "summary": "It will be up to the returning Trump administration to decide whether to finalize the rule.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is moving to cut out addictive nicotine from cigarettes, according to a long-awaited proposed regulation released Wednesday.",
      "The rule aims to force the nearly 12% of Americans still using combustible tobacco products to switch to less dangerous alternatives, like vaping electronic cigarettes or using nicotine lozenges, or quit altogether while ending rates of youth starting to smoke traditional cigarettes.",
      "\"The proposed product standard would limit the addictiveness of the most toxic and widely used tobacco products, which would have significant public health benefits for all age groups,\" the agency wrote in the\u00a0proposed rule.",
      "Though vaping rates have climbed in recent years, fewer adults vape than smoke traditional cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 6% of adults use e-cigarettes.",
      "It will now be up to the returning Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize this measure, which was first floated during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At the time, the head of the FDA called it \"one of the most important actions I could take to advance public health.\"",
      "\"If there is a goal to Make America Healthy Again, I can't imagine anything more important to get done than this,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "A related effort to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes stalled out last year under the Biden administration, amid political blowback over the measure.",
      "The FDA says the proposed rule will apply to traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and pipe tobacco. Cigarette manufacturers will have two years to come into compliance with the rule, after it is finalized.",
      "Agency officials stressed that they were not seeking to ban cigarettes or other tobacco products outright. They acknowledged the rule may result in some illegal imports of high nicotine cigarettes, but not enough to outweigh those switching or quitting. Half of smokers are expected to switch within the first years, they estimate.",
      "\"Even if some amount of illicit trade develops, we will still have a significantly greater magnitude of benefits that would outweigh any impacts of potential illicit markets,\" said Brian King, head of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "Tobacco companies will need to cut nicotine levels to 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco, a fraction of the 17.2 milligrams per gram that most cigarette brands have on average.",
      "Why didn't the FDA ban nicotine earlier?",
      "Progress during the Trump administration halted after then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stepped down from the agency, according to a former top-ranking official.",
      "\"We had no champion. And the day came when I was told by political appointees at FDA to stop talking about menthol and nicotine in my speeches. And we were basically told to stop working on them,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022.",
      "The FDA's tobacco arm turned to other priorities in those years, Zeller said. The agency was facing a surge in youth e-cigarette use that began around 2018.",
      "Zeller credited Gottlieb for advocating for the nicotine regulation within the Trump White House, after the Obama administration had fallen short. Obama officials had promised Zeller they would back rules to curb nicotine and menthol.",
      "\"If you look back on the record, you'll see that the Obama administration did absolutely nothing. It was a very frustrating four years,\" Zeller said.",
      "Under President Biden, Zeller said the White House asked him to lay out a timeline for how a nicotine rule could be finalized by the end of 2024. Zeller said he delivered the plan in one of his last acts before retiring, and was not sure why the Biden administration failed to finalize the rule.",
      "\"I would not be forwarding this timeline to you, if I didn't believe in good conscience that it could be met, as long as clearance times could be sped up,\" Zeller recalled telling White House officials.",
      "Califf defended the agency's delay in comments to media Wednesday, saying that the FDA needed to lay the groundwork for steep legal fights over the rule. He pointed to ongoing court battles \"fighting us tooth and nail\" over graphic warnings on cigarettes, saying \"we will be sued, on anything that comes into action.\"",
      "\"The research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we'll get in court,\" he said.",
      "How can nicotine be removed from cigarettes?",
      "Zeller said agency officials carefully studied whether it was possible to require the industry to make cigarettes without addictive levels of nicotine.",
      "\"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Philip Morris sold a very low-nicotine cigarette called Next. Now, it was not commercially successful. But I believe that Philip Morris more than 30 years ago answered the technical feasibility question for themselves and for the rest of us,\" he said.",
      "The Philip Morris cigarette had been produced with a similar process to decaffeinating coffee. At the time, the company had owned Kraft Foods and its decaf coffee production lines.",
      "A major study from the National Institutes of Health in 2015\u00a0that used reduced-nicotine cigarettes that the NIH contracted to manufacture showed reducing nicotine in cigarettes could substantially curb addiction, proving an idea first outlined in the 1990s.",
      "\"That study and a number of confirmatory studies that followed I think provide a very compelling scientific basis for this could be done,\" Zeller said.",
      "Other companies have found different ways to cut nicotine levels. Cigarette company 22nd Century Group earned the FDA's authorization in 2021 using tobacco that is genetically engineered to have 96% lower nicotine.",
      "While feasible to implement, Zeller predicted that finalizing the rule could face steep opposition from the industry.",
      "If successful, the rule would be an \"existential threat,\" he said, eliminating the main reason that smokers continue to use their products.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:31:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The red food dye is used in products ranging from candies to vegetarian meats.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday it had decided to revoke Red 3's authorization to be added to foods, over concerns about how the food coloring dye has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.",
      "FDA officials have telegraphed the decision for months. While the agency has long said that it did not think evidence of Red 3 causing cancer applied to humans, officials said their hand was forced by a law requiring the agency to pull additives that are cancerous in animals.",
      "\"The Delaney Clause is clear; the FDA cannot authorize a food additive or color additive if it has been found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, referring to the law.",
      "A post on the FDA's website states that Red 3's use in food or drugs \"puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.\"",
      "Hundreds of food brands, including products ranging from candy and fruit cups to snack chips and tomato sauce, have contained Red 3 at some point, according to databases maintained by the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0and the nonprofit\u00a0Environmental Working Group, as well as nutrition labels disclosed by food companies.",
      "Wednesday's decision stems from a petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a number of other groups in 2022, calling for the additive to be pulled from the market. Food brands will have until January 2027 to stop using the dye.",
      "The group has also championed a move by California in 2023 to ban the food dye, which is already banned from use in cosmetics.",
      "\"The primary purpose of food dyes is to make candy, drinks, and other processed foods more attractive. When the function is purely aesthetic, why accept any cancer risk?\" said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in a statement.",
      "While the group has highlighted Red 3's link to cancer in pushes to ban the additive, it is concerned over a different health concern \u2014 the possibility that artificial food dyes could be causing hyperactivity in children \u2014 that has fueled opposition to this and another dye called Red 40 used in many U.S. food products.",
      "An influential review by California''s Environmental Protection Agency of studies on synthetic food dyes, including Red 3, concluded in 2021 that colorants \"can impact neurobehavior in some children.\"",
      "What foods and drinks contain Red 3?",
      "Red 3 has been authorized for use in at least some foods by countries around the world, according to the International Association of Color Manufacturers, under other names like erythrosine or E 127. In Europe, Red 3 is only permitted for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries.",
      "In the U.S., Red 3 is used in some candies, including Jelly Belly's Candy Corn, Tootsie's Dubble Bubble ball gum and Ring Pop's strawberry and berry blast flavors. Other foods also use Red 3, like Del Monte cherry mixed fruit cups, MorningStar Farms vegetarian Bacon Strips and Pillsbury's birthday cake cookie dough.",
      "Several drinks rely on Red 3 as well, among them Ensure's creamy peach nutrition shake and Nesquik's strawberry lowfat milk.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the candy industry pledged to comply with the FDA's guidance and safety standards. Industry groups have been calling on the agency to step up its regulation of food additives, citing concerns that a vacuum left by FDA inaction could lead to a frustrating patchwork of state laws for national food brands.",
      "\"Our consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework. We have been saying for years that FDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety,\" said the National Confections Association's statement.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the federal department that will oversee the FDA, has been critical of the agency for not moving to curb use of certain food additives.",
      "Kennedy and his allies have\u00a0also called for\u00a0tightening the FDA's approach to regulating food additives, which critics have derided as a \"loophole\" allowing in concerning ingredients. That process is separate from artificial colors like Red 3 and Red 40, which must jump through steep hurdles to gain the FDA's authorization and are carefully tested for purity before being used in the market.",

    "summary": "The death risk goes up to 1 in 100 for those who drink alcohol nine times per week, the report found.",
    "story": [
      "Consuming more than one drink a day results in a steep increase of the risk of premature death, a new federal review has concluded. The draft report was published Tuesday ahead of a major update to influential federal guidelines on how much alcohol Americans should drink.",
      "\"In the United States, males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. This risk increases to 1 in 100 if they consume more than 9 drinks per week,\" the report's authors concluded, in a final draft published by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The review is one of two written by committees of outside experts to inform this year's update to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The other was published last month by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.",
      "The upcoming guidelines are important because the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies often rely on the recommendations to justify new rules, like on how to label food and drinks. Men are currently recommended to limit intake to no more than two drinks per day and women are recommended to limit to one drink per day.",
      "\"Once you're over a drink a day, your risk of dying from alcohol is already above one percent. Some people may think that doesn't sound like a lot, but in terms of a public health guideline, that would be really, really high,\" said Dr. Timothy Naimi, director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research and one of the authors of the report.",
      "Naimi was careful to say that the report was \"not endorsing any level of risk\" caused by drinking, but pointed to other countries and health regulations that have used 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 death risks as thresholds to set rules.",
      "It is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will incorporate the findings of the latest report into any updated guidelines. In 2020, the Trump administration rejected a call by its outside expert panel to recommend limiting drinking for all Americans to no more than once per day, saying the \"emerging evidence\" did not support the move.",
      "The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade coalition that represents spirits producers, called in a statement co-signed by other industry groups on the federal government to reject the findings of the panel.",
      "\"Today's report is the product of a flawed, opaque and unprecedented process, rife with bias and conflicts of interest,\" the statement said,\" accusing some of the experts on the federal panel of having ties to international anti-alcohol advocacy organizations.",
      "\"Congress never authorized or appropriated money for the panel or its work, and numerous letters from Congress and industry have voiced serious concerns over the process,\" the statement said.",
      "Alcohol linked to deaths from cancer, injuries, other causes",
      "The report was designed to weigh all of the data on a range of diseases and injuries, and boiled down a complex web of studies that have looked at alcohol's health risks and benefits into \"alcohol-attributable death\" estimates.",
      "This modeling is likely underestimating the true health risks of alcohol, Naimi said, given limits in how researchers can study its health impacts.",
      "Risks can also vary widely from person to person, the report cautions, meaning some harms can be very small for some even if they add up to substantial risks at the public health level.",
      "\"The overall effect of alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality is dependent upon the risk of diseases and injuries that are causally related to alcohol. These risks are affected by numerous factors, including smoking, diet, physical activity, obesity, hepatitis infection, and genetics,\" the report states.",
      "At one drink a day, the report estimated that injuries and cancer added up to the biggest contributors of the risk for a premature death.",
      "For men, injuries made up a substantial portion of the risk of dying. This includes a variety of accidents, road injuries and intentional harm, like suicide and violence linked to drinking.",
      "Cancer, which was next largest factor, made up a third of the additional risk of death for men.",
      "For women consuming one drink a day, the risk of death from cancer was statistically similar or larger compared to the increased risk of fatal injuries.",
      "Increased risk of a number of cancers \u2014 colorectal, female breast cancer, and cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and esophagus \u2014 \"begins with any alcohol use and increases with higher levels of use,\" the report states.",
      "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued an advisory earlier this month calling for a warning about the risk of cancer to be included on alcoholic beverages.",
      "Liver disease poses the next highest risk, and can be especially risky for people with other underlying conditions like hepatitis C that make people vulnerable.",
      "One risk that was lower in people drinking once per day, compared with never drinking, was for ischemic stroke. But that apparent benefit virtually disappears at two drinks per day.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, got a head start on those plans by debuting new his-and-her meme coins \u2014 \u00a0the $Trump and $Melania coins \u2014 over the weekend. As of Monday afternoon, the day of Mr. Trump's inauguration, the two digital currencies were worth a combined $9.5 billion.",
      "Meme coins, which have no economic or transactional value, are cryptocurrencies linked to internet trends, such as Dogecoin, which was inspired by the image of a shiba inu dog. Dogecoin became a favored cryptocurrency of billionaire Elon Musk, who even named his federal cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, after it.",
      "Mr. Trump announced his cryptocurrency on Friday night, writing on social media that the coin celebrates \"everything we stand for: WINNING!\" The meme coin is being marketed with a picture of Trump holding a fist up superimposed over the words \"FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT,\" a reference to Trump's response to an assassination attempt at a political rally in July.",
      "On Sunday, Melania Trump announced her own meme coin with a black-and-white photo of the First Lady smiling and with her hands clasped in front of her face, as if in thanks.",
      "The new meme coins are a way for Mr. Trump to leverage his online popularity, drawing his supporters to the project, noted Joe McCann, CEO of digital assets investment firm Asymmetric. The products, like Mr. Trump's social media company, tend to attract individual investors, rather than large U.S. institutional firms, who buy shares as a way to show support for the president.",
      "\"Meme coins largely represent communities on the internet represented by a financial asset \u2014 they're the tokenization of internet culture,\" McCann told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Donald Trump is arguably the most popular person on the internet, so by launching a meme coin, members of his community can further gain proximity to him.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to monetize his name with numerous commercial ventures, ranging from a licensing deal for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, that earned him $7.2 million, to a\u00a0$59.99 Bible\u00a0that earned him $300,000 in royalties. He's also recently rolled out Trump-branded sneakers, a \"Fight, Fight, Fight\"-branded perfume and watches.",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump coins.",
      "How much are the Donald and Melania Trump meme coins worth?",
      "As of Monday afternoon, the Trump meme coin had a market cap of $8.3 billion, while Melania Trump's cryptocurrency was valued at $1.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Mr. Trump's meme coin soared after it debuted, hitting a peak of almost $75 each. But the price has shed about 45% of its value since then, settling at about $40 per coin on Monday afternoon. Still, that represents a surge of more than 400% from its initial price, CoinMarketCap data shows.",
      "Melania Trump's meme coin has had a slightly rockier debut, sinking more than 20% to about $5.40 per coin on Monday.",
      "Are $Trump and $Melania real investments?",
      "The Trump meme coin website says the president's cryptocurrency is meant as an expression of support \u2014 not an investment opportunity.",
      "The Melania site describes the meme coins as \"digital collectibles,\" adding that they \"are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract or security of any type.\"",
      "Investors typically scrutinize balance sheets and income statements when deciding where to allocate their funds, while currency traders will examine economic factors like trade flow and GDP growth when placing their investments. But relying on these traditional measures don't work with meme coins because they aren't tied to an underlying asset or economy, experts note.",
      "\"Attempting to use traditional financial models to value a meme coin will fail miserably,\" McCann noted. \"Business schools don't teach students how to measure culture, virality or communities.\"",
      "Are meme coins risky?",
      "Meme coins are a highly volatile corner of the crypto sector that often start as a joke and have no intrinsic value, although they can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Because of those dynamics, their prices are prone sudden and extreme swings.",
      "\"Meme coins are some of the most volatile assets on earth and should be treated with caution and care,\" McCann said.",
      "The site selling the $Trump coin warned buyers that its price \"may be extremely volatile and you may experience substantial losses in connection with a sale or other disposition of Trump Memes.\"",
      "Meme coins gained popularity in 2021 and 2022, but some inexperienced investors were unprepared for digital currencies' extreme volatility, noted Nigel Green, CEO of wealth management firm deVere Group, in an email. As a result, he's advising investors to be cautious before putting their money into the Trump meme coins.",
      "How can you buy the Trump and Melania meme coins?",
      "The meme coins are available to buy on an app called Moonshot, which allows people to buy meme coins with Apple Pay, credit or debit card, cryptocurrency, or payment apps like PayPal and Venmo.",
      "The Trump meme coin website notes that all transactions \"ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. We shall have no responsibility or liability for any Trump Memes that are lost, misplaced or inaccessible.\"",
      "What is the cryptocurrency industry's view?",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin's release, saying it reflects the president's support for an industry that felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. Mr. Trump has promised to usher in crypto-friendly regulations and picked crypto backers for key government positions.",
      "For instance, Mr. Trump has nominated cryptocurrency supporter Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, reinforcing optimism that the new president will deregulate the sector.",
      "Other cryptocurrencies are gaining in value on anticipation that the second Trump administration will benefit the sector. Bitcoin, for instance, soared more than 50% since the November election, surging to a record peak of $109,241 ahead of Mr. Trump's inauguration ceremony.",

      "DOGE, which isn't an official government agency, was tasked by Trump to produce recommendations on trimming federal outlays, with billionaires Musk and Ramaswamy saying they aimed to cut about $500 billion in annual expenditures. The lawsuit claims that DOGE so far appears to have largely appointed three types of people to work on its efforts: tech industry executives, people affiliated with the Trump campaign and his prior administration as well as associates of Musk or Ramaswamy's.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that, as a result, DOGE is in violation of FACA because \"not a single member of DOGE is a federal employee or represents the perspective of federal employees, despite the evidence that DOGE intends to provide recommendations regarding federal employment practices and ways to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\"",
      "It also claims that DOGE is violating the law's mandate that advisory committee meetings must be open to the public, noting that Musk and Ramaswamy have held private meetings with various elected officials, as well as with tech executives.",
      "\"Nobody disputes that there is a huge amount of wasteful spending in the federal government,\" Kel McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our only concern is that DOGE, as it is currently constituted, lacks the expertise to understand how its recommendations will backfire if it pushes federal workers out without understanding why they are there in the first place.",
      "He added, \"Government work is not corporate work, and any recommendations made without that perspective are doomed to fail.\"",
      "The lawsuit's plaintiffs include two men who sent in applications to be hired by DOGE. One, Jerald Lentini, is an attorney for National Security Counselors, while the second, Joshua Erlich, is an attorney who frequently represents federal employees and could represent their viewpoints, the lawsuit notes. Neither has heard back from DOGE about their applications.",
      "\"Plaintiffs conclude that, upon information and belief, neither Lentini nor Erlich, nor anyone similarly situated who would represent the perspectives of federal employees (including national security employees), unions, or accountability and transparency advocates, will be selected for DOGE,\" the lawsuit claims.",

      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Biden last week of a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\" The group's sharp-edged report, titled \"Takers Not Makers,\" also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation - including his own - and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\"What you're seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\" Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\"It's not about one specific individual. It's the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\" he added.",
      "Like Biden's call for making billionaires \"begin to pay their fair share\" through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam - a global advocacy group - called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \"dismantle the new aristocracy.\"",

      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \"barely changed\" since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes' \"Real-Time Billionaire List\" as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \"minted\" every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \"crony connections,\" it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \"Global Risks Report,\" which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \"societal polarization\" - a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 170 million TikTok users in the U.S. were in for a rude awakening late Saturday night when the enormously popular video-sharing app became inaccessible because of a law passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress last year.",
      "TikTok voluntarily shut down service to its users ahead of Sunday's ban. Users in the U.S. who opened the app were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",
      "TikTok was also no longer available in the Apple or Google Play stores. CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment.",
      "Lawmakers and U.S. officials have sounded the alarm for years about the supposed risks that TikTok's ties to China pose to national security, and Congress moved last year to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. The law gave the company a deadline of Jan. 19 \u2014 one day before a new president would take office.",
      "With no sign of a sale in sight, TikTok's last-ditch legal challenge failed on Friday\u00a0when the Supreme Court said the law does not violate the First Amendment.",
      "The Biden White House said it will leave enforcement of the law to the incoming Trump administration, and President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to \"save\" the app. On Saturday, Trump told NBC News he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law allows the president, under some circumstances, to grant a one-time extension of up to 90 days regarding the date when the law goes into effect.",
      "TikTok had hinted it would take itself offline, a move that leaves content creators and users in the lurch as the company seeks a way to get back on firm legal footing.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that the Biden administration had \"failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had earlier Saturday called TikTok's latest statement \"a stunt.\"",
      "\"We have seen the most recent statement from TikTok,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"It is a stunt, and we see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday. We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",

      "\"Taking control of your finances can absolutely help you feel more in control of your life overall, and that sense of control is incredibly important for mental well-being,\" Berwise said. \"A big part of financial stress comes from focusing on things we can't control \u2014 like rising prices or taxes.

      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a challenge to a new law requiring TikTok to either sever ties with its China-based parent company or be banned in the United States, finding it did not violate the First Amendment rights of the platform or its users.",
      "The high court's unsigned decision clears the way for the law, passed last April, to take effect at midnight Sunday, and follows years of concerns raised by the federal government \u2014 during both the Trump and Biden administrations \u2014 about the risks TikTok poses to national security.",

      "\"The act's prohibitions and divestiture requirement are designed to prevent China \u2014 a designated foreign adversary \u2014 from leveraging its control over ByteDance Ltd. to capture the personal data of U.S. TikTok users. This objective qualifies as an important government interest under intermediate scrutiny,\" the court said, referencing the middle standard applied by courts to assess the constitutionality of a law.",
      "Under intermediate scrutiny, a challenged law must further an important government interest and be substantially related to that interest to be upheld. It is a less demanding standard than strict scrutiny, the highest level of judicial review, and more stringent than rational-basis review, the lowest, most lenient tier.",
      "The court noted that TikTok \"collects extensive personal information from and about its users,\" including location data and contact lists. The justices reiterated the government's concerns that such information may allow China to track the locations of federal employees, craft dossiers of information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.",

      "Its provisions \"clearly serve the government's data collection interest,\" the court said, and are not broader than needed to address concerns about China's access to Americans' personal information.",
      "The court noted the government's interest in preventing China from having control over TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm and its ability to covertly alter the content appearing on the app for users in the U.S. But it said the record in the case \"adequately supports the conclusion that Congress would have passed the challenged provisions based on the data collection justification alone.\"",
      "According to Congress and the Biden administration, the court said, ByteDance uses data collected from TikTok to train the app's recommendation algorithm and would not agree to stop collecting U.S. users' data or sending it to China. The government also noted the challenges with monitoring data-sharing between TikTok and its parent company.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, we find the government's data collection justification sufficient to sustain the challenged provisions,\" the court said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch issued a separate opinion agreeing with the outcome of the case, but splitting with the court's legal reasoning. He wrote that the court was right to refrain from endorsing the government's goal of preventing the purported covert manipulation of content by China.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" he wrote. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them.

      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community.

      "TikTok and the Supreme Court",
      "Congress and the Biden administration have raised national security concerns about TikTok for years. Federal employees cannot have the app on their government-issued phones, and a majority of states have barred the platform on state government devices.",
      "The law aims to prevent China from collecting substantial amounts of data from the platform's 170 million U.S. users and covertly manipulate the content on TikTok to harm the U.S. by sowing discord and division, federal officials have said.",
      "But TikTok, which curates short videos for users through a powerful recommendation algorithm, said it is a U.S. company that is protected by the First Amendment from Congress' attempt to ban the platform.",
      "During arguments, the justices appeared poised to uphold the law, though several expressed concerns that it could conflict with the First Amendment. Still, many of the court's members seemed to agree that the law targeted TikTok's ownership by a foreign company, ByteDance, instead of the speech shared on the platform.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the U.S. government, said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the Supreme Court's decision would be \"enormously consequential.\" If the companies are forced to cut ties, he said, TikTok \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. Other social media platforms have tried to replicate the algorithm, but have been unable to match TikTok's, according to Jeffrey Fisher, who represented the creators. China has said it is opposed to the sale of TikTok's algorithm.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Jan. 19, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores. If TikTok doesn't shut down voluntarily, experts told CBS News that the experience for users who already have it on their phones would likely suffer with time because they would no longer receive software updates.",
      "Several of the justices on the liberal and conservative wings of the bench repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok's collection of data from its American users and the Chinese government's access to that personal information.",
      "\"Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Francisco, referring to ByteDance.",
      "Congress found that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence work and ensure it has the power to access private data the company holds, Roberts said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, warned of the future implications of the Chinese government having access to data from the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every month.",
      "Congress and the president, he said, were worried that China \"would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or the State Department. Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Francisco claimed that TikTok would \"have to go mute\" unless it severs ties from ByteDance, but Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back on that characterization of the law.",
      "\"If TikTok were to, post-divestiture or whatever, pre-divestiture, come up with its own algorithm, then when the divestiture happened, it could still operate. It doesn't say, 'TikTok, you can't speak,'\" she said, adding that TikTok can remain in the U.S. as long as it's not associated with ByteDance.",
      "In its opinion, the high court focused primarily on the data collection concerns raised by Congress and the Justice Department, finding that the law is sufficiently tailored to address the U.S. government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary, China, from collecting \"vast swaths\" of sensitive information from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "For Americans who rely on TikTok to exchange ideas about all manner of topics, from politics to entertainment to the news, the stakes of the case are high. Creators who challenged the law said they use it to sell products, reach thousands of people and create a nationwide community.",
      "\"That's our editor and publisher of choice that we think best disseminates our speech,\" Fisher said.",
      "Trump attempted to effectively ban TikTok during his first term in office because of national security concerns, though his executive order targeting the app was blocked by a federal court and then rescinded by Mr. Biden. But the president-elect has reversed course on his view of the platform.",
      "Trump told Newsmax in an interview this week that he's \"not opposed\" to TikTok and said his campaign's use of the app helped him win over young voters in the November presidential election.",

      "The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit on Friday accusing Walgreens of filling millions of unlawful opioid prescriptions.",
      "The civil suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Walgreen Boots Alliance, Walgreen Co. and its various subsidiaries   alleges the pharmacy giant knowingly filled millions of unlawful prescriptions for controlled substances from approximately August 2012 through to the present. Walgreens allegedly filled prescriptions for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, the lawsuit said, including early refills among other prescriptions.",
      "\"Our complaint alleges that Walgreens pharmacists filled millions of controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated the prescriptions were highly likely to be unlawful, and that Walgreens systematically pressured its pharmacists to fill prescriptions, including controlled substance prescriptions, without taking the time needed to confirm their validity,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division said in a statement. \"These practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\"",
      "Walgreens pharmacists filled these unlawful prescriptions despite clear \"red flags,\" the complaint alleges, and the pharmacy giant ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources that its stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, the suit claims.",
      "Pharmacists were pressured to fill prescriptions quickly without taking the time needed to confirm each prescription's validity, the complaint said. Walgreens also deprived pharmacists of crucial information and prevented them from warning one another about certain prescribers.",
      "Four different whistleblowers who previously worked for Walgreens in various parts of the country filed whistleblower actions, the statement said.",
      "Walgreens responded to the lawsuit in a statement on its website which read that it stands \"behind our pharmacists, dedicated healthcare professionals who live in the communities they serve, filling legitimate prescriptions for FDA-approved medications written by DEA-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.\"",
      "\"We look forward to the opportunity to defend the professionalism and integrity of our pharmacists,\" the statement said.",
      "Last month the Justice Department\u00a0filed a similar lawsuit against CVS, alleging the pharmacy chain filled prescriptions with dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, agreed to fill opioid prescriptions early and made \"trinity prescriptions,\" which are a dangerous combination of drugs.",
      "Walgreens is one of the country's largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 pharmacies across the U.S. Walgreens plans to close hundreds of stores by the end of 2025 to turn around its flagging sales, and has already closed roughly 2,000 locations over the past decade, the company said.",

    "title": "As Biden exits, how will he be remembered for his handling of the U.S. economy?",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 17:25:31 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy rebounded strongly from the COVID shock, but the U.S. continues to grapple with a cost-of-living crisis and spiraling federal debt.",
    "story": [
      "As President Biden prepares to depart the White House, he leaves an economic legacy marked by a historic pandemic that paralyzed consumers and businesses across the U.S.",
      "After inheriting a COVID-scarred nation in 2021, Mr. Biden focused on righting the economy, a strategy that economists told CBS MoneyWatch is visible in the country's solid GDP growth and low unemployment. By several key measures, the economy is stronger than it was four years ago: The jobless rate is near a 50-year low, wages are growing and the U.S. managed to sidestep a recession widely expected by many on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve moved to curb inflation by ratcheting up interest rates.",
      "\"He should have a strong legacy when it comes to the economy,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said of Mr. Biden. \"He inherited an economy that was flat on its back because of the COVID pandemic, and he's leaving an economy that's flying high, at least in the aggregate,\"",
      "Zandi added, \"How much he can take credit for that, it's a reasonable debate, but I think he deserves a lot of credit.\"",
      "Zandi pointed to several pieces of landmark legislation passed under Biden, including the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, as helping to stabilize the nation and produce growth that has surpassed most other major economies around the world.",
      "Biden also score some wins on health care, such as a new $2,000 out-of-pocket\u00a0spending cap on prescriptions for Medicare enrollees and a $35 cap on insulin prices.",
      "Yet in retrospect, he added, additional trillions in federal stimulus may have played a part in the soaring inflation of the last few years, which Zandi said was also fueled by the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "ARPA \"was very controversial, but at the end of the day it got the economy back to full employment,\" Zandi said.",
      "Deep structural problems",
      "Although Biden's policies were key in helping the economy recover from the pandemic, millions of Americans continue to struggle with a cost-of-living crisis worsened by the hottest inflation in four decades. Long-term challenges in housing affordability only deepened during the Biden administration, while U.S. wealth inequality today remains near record levels.",
      "To be sure, health care, child care and education costs have outpaced inflation\u00a0for years, weighing on millions households and making many families vulnerable to even minor downturns. But the inflation spike in 2022 intensified these existing financial pains, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank.",
      "\"The American economy for a long time has been characterized by a lack of affordability for the biggest ticket items,\" Owens said. \"Housing has been out of reach, health care has been expensive, child care is expensive \u2014 that was all true before Biden.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Biden plan to sweep away student loan debt was largely\u00a0shot down by the courts, although the Department of Education used other means to offer relief to millions of borrowers. Housing costs continued to soar under Biden due to rising home values as well as soaring mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to battle inflation.",
      "The upshot: Under Biden, many households remained dogged by the same long-term pocketbook issues that have prevailed for decades under previous presidential administrations. During the pandemic, the soaring cost of essentials like food, fuel and rent only deepened the country's widespread precarity \u2014 a gnawing sense of financial insecurity that has left tens of millions of Americans vulnerable to job losses, medical problems and even modest economic dips.",
      "Ballooning debt",
      "Biden's legislative wins \u2014 ARPA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act in 2022 \u2014 added trillions in additional federal spending. The idea underlying these efforts was to rejuvenate the U.S. economy by investing in key sectors, such as by building semiconductor chip plants, rebuilding U.S. roads or accelerating the shift toward green energy.",
      "But those efforts will likely take years to pay off, economists note. In the meantime, the nation's debt has ballooned to a record $36.2 trillion as of mid-January due to a combination of fiscal stimulus authorized by both Biden and Trump, as well as Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "With federal spending outpacing revenues, the nation will face tough choices, such as whether to raise taxes, cut federal programs or both. Asked to describe Biden's economic legacy, Cato Institute vice president of general economics Scott Lincicome summarized it in one word: \"Frustrating.\"",
      "\"If you could look at the basic fundamentals \u2014 economic growth, jobs \u2014 things have been pretty good,\" Lincicome, who describes himself as a \"libertarian free marketer,\" added. \"But if you look beneath the hood, there are some rather significant problems.\"",
      "Chief among them are the nation's spiraling debt, Lincicome said. Treasury yields have been rising ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, partly due to concerns that the U.S. could struggle in coming years to service its debt.",
      "\"In terms of what Trump inherits \u2014 and it's not just Biden's fault, Trump did a lot of COVID spending, too \u2014 but we're now at a point where you can see bond markets are chirping, and you can see inflation has remained stubbornly higher than we would have hoped,\" Lincicome noted. \"The [Congressional Budget Office] and a lot of other folks agree that the debt is a pretty pressing issue.\"",
      "Trump's economy on Jan. 20",
      "Despite such concerns, the economists interviewed by CBS MoneyWatch say that Trump will inherit a strong economy when he's inaugurated. The nation's unemployment rate is 4.1%, down from 6.4% when Biden took office in January of 2021. In another plus for workers, average hourly earnings through December rose\u00a03.9%, keeping pay growth\u00a0ahead of consumer prices, which are up 2.9% over the last year.",
      "Not surprising, then, that Zandi and Lincicome had the same advice for the Trump administration in how it handles the U.S. economy: \"Do no harm.\"",
      "\"The best thing Trump could do is do nothing,\" Zandi said. \"Biden got a basket case economy and he's bequeathing an economy that is operating at full tilt.\"",
      "For his part, Trump has signaled his intent to reshape the economy through a combination of steeper tariffs, deeper tax cuts, fewer federal regulations and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"Joe Biden's legacy is marred by crippling inflation, a migrant crime invasion and American weakness on the world stage,\" Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Thankfully, in just five days, President Trump will usher in a new Golden Age of American success and carry out his mandate to make America wealthy, safe, strong and great again.\"",
      "Economists view some of Trump's stated plans as potentially inflationary, although some question whether the president-elect will follow through with all of them, such as a broad-based tariff on all imports.",
      "\"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a December research note.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration wants to extend his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), an effort the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected could add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Trump has vowed that his tariffs would raise enough money to cover the tax cuts, a proposition that economists assess as unlikely.",
      "Tariffs could raise \"a few hundred billion, maybe, but that's total, and you're still in a massive hole,\" Lincicome noted.",
      "American oligarchs",
      "Extending the tax cuts would also likely favor the nation's wealthiest households, given that the TCJA cut taxes for top earners far more than for low- or middle-income Americans. During the past four years, America's richest people have seen their wealth soar, with Elon Musk \u2014 the world's richest person and a close adviser and backer of Trump \u2014 now worth $450 billion, more than double his $175 billion net worth when Biden was inaugurated in 2021, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "In his farewell message on Wednesday, Biden warned that the growing concentration of wealth in the U.S. poses a serious risk to the nation.",
      "\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden said.",
      "That's unlikely to change under Trump, economists predicted \"The big story of American inequality is a simple one: It's the takeoff in top incomes,\" Owens noted.",
      "She believes that \"Until we tax the top, we will have runaway income inequality.\"",

    "story": [
      "The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \"stamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\" while putting the new administration on notice.",

      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it. Over the past fiscal year the department found more than 4,000 children in all industries employed in violation of federal child labor laws.",

      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",

      "Dangerous conditions",
      "Some of the settlements included a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, that paid a $165,000 penalty following\u00a0the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation's largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota.",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia.

The company must also pay a fine of $55 million into the CFPB's victims relief fund.",

      "Failure to investigate potential fraud",
      "Peer-to-peer platforms such as Cash App are generally required by law, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions. But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",

      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be treasury secretary, Scott Bessent fielded sharp questions Thursday at his confirmation hearing from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS tax filing system.",
      "Bessent told the Senate Finance Committee that the U.S. faces economic calamity if Congress doesn't renew provisions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He also argued the Federal Reserve should remain independent from the president's influence and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil should be more aggressive.",
      "He was introduced by a fellow South Carolinian, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said the U.S. needs a treasury secretary \"who knows what he's doing, has the trust of the president and loves his country.\" Graham added, \"Your ship came in with this guy.\"",
      "But Democrats, including Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado, expressed frustration that Trump's promise to extend provisions of his 2017 tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and add to the growing national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion.",
      "Bennet accused Bessent of shedding \"crocodile tears\" over the debt and spending, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act drove up the debt. \"There's so many things I think you owe the American people after we have seen the catastrophe\" from the tax cuts.",
      "Bessent is a billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, including Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also asked Bessent a series of questions about reducing national spending to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining the IRS' Direct File program \u2014 which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free \u2014 at least for the 2025 tax season, which begins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers call the program a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular.",
      "He also called for stronger sanctions on Russia, criticizing the Biden administration for a sanctions regime he said isn't \"muscular\" enough. \"I believe the previous administration was worried about raising U.S. energy prices during an election season,\" Bessent said.",
      "Bessent was one of several people Trump considered for the position. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee, also mulling over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president's fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president's National Economic Council.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut.",
      "Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident.",
      "\"Productive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,\" Bessent testified.",
      "Senators were expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions in advance, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight.",
      "In addition, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are circulating a document that alleges Bessent has avoided paying roughly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund. During the hearing, Bessent said he and his husband are up to date on their taxes, and he is in litigation over the portion of his taxes in controversy. He also committed to shuttering his firm if confirmed to be treasury secretary.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years.",

The units earned will be paid out to the schools starting in 2026 on a rolling three-year basis.",
      "The longer a school stays in the tournament, the more units the school's conference receives. With a Final Four appearance, a team could bring its conference $1.26 million over the next three years. The revenue distribution plan for the women's tournament is similar to the men's.",

      "Worries about everyday expenses helped return President-elect Donald Trump to the White House. But with his second term quickly approaching, many U.S. adults are skeptical about his ability to bring down costs.",
      "Only about 2 in 10 Americans are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident that Trump will be able to make progress on lowering the cost of groceries, housing or health care this year, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, while about 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident.",
      "Trump, who was named 2024 Person of the Year by Time Magazine, acknowledged in an interview with the publication that bringing down food costs will be a difficult challenge.",
      "\"I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard. But I think that they will,\" he said.",
      "Faith in Trump's ability to create jobs is a little higher \u2014 about 3 in 10 are extremely or very confident the Republican will make progress on this in 2025 \u2014 but the poll indicates that despite his sweeping promises about lowering prices, a substantial chunk of his own supporters don't have high confidence in his ability to quickly alleviate the economic pressures that continue to frustrate many households.",
      "Fed up with the economy, Americans turn to TrumpTrump's proposed tariffs could raise U.S. grocery prices",
      "Fed up with the economy, Americans turn to Trump",
      "Trump's proposed tariffs could raise U.S. grocery prices",
      "Those tempered expectations haven't dampened Republicans' hopes for Trump's second presidential term, though. And Democrats' pessimism about his return to office is more muted than it was when he\u00a0exited\u00a0the White House in 2020. About 8 in 10 Republicans say Trump will be a \"great\" or \"good\" president in his second term, according to the poll.",
      "And while Democrats' assessments are much more negative \u2014 about 8 in 10 say he will be a \"poor\" or \"terrible\" president \u2014 they are less likely to say he'll be a \"terrible\" president in his second term than they were at the end of his\u00a0first.",
      "Much of the 2024 presidential campaign revolved around prices \u2014 whether President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was to blame for inflation and whether Trump could fix it. AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of voters and nonvoters that aims to tell the story behind election results, showed that about 4 in 10 voters in the November election identified the economy and jobs as the most important issue facing the country and that about 6 in 10 of those voters cast their ballot for Trump.",
      "As Trump takes office, though, the poll shows that many Americans don't anticipate that he will be able to immediately bring costs down. That includes some of his own supporters. Less than half of Republicans are at least \"very\" confident that Trump will make progress on lowering food costs, housing costs or health care costs, although about 6 in 10 are at least \"very\" confident in his ability to create jobs.",
      "Confidence in Trump's ability to handle the broader economic situation is also fairly low. Only about one-third of Americans are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident in his ability to handle the economy and jobs. Nearly 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident, and about half are \"slightly confident\" or \"not at all confident.\"",
      "Here, Republicans have more faith in Trump's abilities \u2014 about 7 in 10 are at least \"very\" confident in his ability to handle the economy in general.",
      "Health care costs",
      "But there are other policy areas where expectations for Trump aren't high across the board. Similar to the economy and jobs, about one-third of Americans are at least \"very\" confident in Trump's ability to handle immigration and national security, while about 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident and about half are \"slightly\" or \"not at all\" confident.",
      "Americans are especially skeptical of Trump's ability to bring down health care costs or handle the issue of health care at all, the poll found. Only about 2 in 10 Americans are extremely or very confident in his ability to tackle health care issues, and 16% are confident in his ability to make progress on lowering health care costs.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he would look at alternatives to the Affordable Care Act. He has not offered a concrete plan of what his changes to the health care law would be, but he spent a lot of energy during his first term on efforts to dismantle it that were ultimately unsuccessful.",
      "Only about half of Republicans are extremely or very confident in Trump's ability to handle health care, and about one-third are at least very confident he'll make progress on lowering the cost of heath care.",
      "Trump's favorability remains steady",
      "Trump's favorability rating has remained steady through four indictments, a criminal conviction and two attempted assassinations, and the new survey shows that Americans' expectations for his second term match their assessment of his first four years in office. Slightly fewer than half of U.S. adults expect Trump will be a \"terrible\" or \"poor\" president in his second term, essentially unchanged from when he left the White House in 2021.",
      "But Republicans are expecting even bigger things from Trump this time, while Democrats' fears appear to be a little more muted. About half of Republicans say they think Trump will be a \"great\" president in his second term, while about 4 in 10 Republicans described him as a great president at the end of his first term. Democrats still overwhelmingly expect that Trump will be a \"terrible\" president, but that concern has lessened.",

    "summary": "With the U.S. ban on TikTok looming, many Americans are opting for another Chinese app known as RedNote. It could be short-lived.",
    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump took power for another four years on Monday, vowing to create a nation that is \"greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before\" as he heralded his return to the White House.",
      "\"The golden age of America begins right now,\" Mr. Trump began his 30-minute speech. \"From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he is \"confident and optimistic\" that the U.S. is \"at the start of a thrilling new era of national success.\"",
      "\"From this moment on, America's decline is over,\" he declared, reiterating a similar theme from his 2017 speech, when he portrayed himself as the only one who could save the nation.",
      "He asserted that he not only has a political mandate to carry out his agenda, but also a divine one, after he survived an assassination attempt months before he won the election.",
      "\"I felt then and believed even more so now that my life was saved for a reason, I was saved by God to make America great again,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump painted a bleak picture of the nation, saying he's that he's taking over a government facing \"a crisis of trust,\" adding that a \"radical and corrupt establishment\" has left the nation in \"disrepair.\" He said the federal government can no longer provide basic services and claimed that the situation at the southern border is out of control.",
      "He vowed to declare a national emergency at the southern border in one of his first acts in office, saying \"all illegal entry will immediately be halted.\" He also said he would begin the process of deporting millions of criminal undocumented immigrants and send troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as designating cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "Mr. Trump also outlined a number of other policies, including reinstating service members who were \"unjustly expelled\" from the military for refusing vaccine requirements, renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the \"Gulf of America\" and saying that under his administration there will be only \"two genders.\"",
      "The president moved the day's activities indoors, citing the extreme cold, greatly limiting the number of people who could attend his swearing-in ceremony. Instead of standing for hours in the cold on the National Mall, his supporters watched the pomp and circumstance at Capital One Arena in downtown Washington, where Mr. Trump later gave remarks and\u00a0signed a flurry of executive actions to reverse Biden administration mandates and implement his own policies.",
      "Mr. Trump also teased that he would be signing pardons later Monday for those convicted for their roles in the assault on the Capitol in 2021.",
      "One of the first actions the president took was signing was an order to fly flags at full-staff for presidential inaugurations. Biden had ordered flags to be lowered through the end of January out of respect for former\u00a0President Jimmy Carter, who\u00a0died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. The code says the U.S. flag should be flown at half-staff for 30 days from the death of a president or former president at all federal government buildings and grounds. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, ordered the flags to be flown at full-staff at the U.S. Capitol during Mr. Trump's inauguration. Flags at the White House were raised Monday afternoon.",
      "Mr. Trump, who returns to office as a convicted felon, also invoked the legal troubles he's faced since leaving office during his inauguration speech.",
      "\"Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents \u2014 something I know something about,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again under my leadership. We will restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.\"",
      "Fearing that Mr. Trump would retaliate against his political enemies, former President Joe\u00a0Biden issued a number of pardons during his last hours in office, including those associated with the investigation into the Capitol riot as well as his own family members.",
      "Mr. Trump took the oath of office in a rare indoor ceremony in the Capitol in the same room where a violent mob of his supporters stormed through four years earlier to block Congress from certifying Biden's election victory.",
      "Wearing a navy suit and purple tie, Mr. Trump took the oath administered by Chief Justice John Roberts at 12:01 p.m. Mr. Trump was accompanied by his wife, Melania, who wore a long navy coat and matching hat, as well as his five children, Don Jr., Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany and Barron.",
      "The ceremony was also attended by Mr. Trump's predecessors, a tradition the president defied in 2021 as he falsely claimed the election was stolen from him. Former first lady Michelle Obama was absent \u2014 her office had said ahead of the inauguration that she would not attend. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump and his wife had tea at the White House with the outgoing president and first lady, another tradition the Trumps did not observe when Biden succeeded him in 2021.",
      "Shortly after 1 p.m., Mr. Trump and the first lady stood alongside the Bidens on the east side of the U.S. Capitol. Former Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, said their goodbyes and were ushered away in a black SUV.",
      "Biden and his wife boarded the presidential helicopter, which flew them out of Washington to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.",

      "In the 6 p.m. hour, Mr. Trump signed more orders before a packed Capitol One Arena, in Washington, D.C. Among them, a requirement that federal workers return to full-time work in person immediately, a freeze on all federal hiring, except by the military and some other excluded categories.",
      "He signed a directive to every department and agency in the federal government to address inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive action withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Treaty, and he claimed the U.S. would save a trillion dollars by leaving the agreement.",
      "Another federal directive ordered the federal government to restore freedom of speech and prevent government censorship of free speech going forward.",
      "And the final order he signed at Capitol One was a directive to the federal government ending the weaponization of government by the Biden administration against the political adversaries of the previous administration, that is, his first administration.",
      "Trump's plans include executive orders \"unleashing American energy,\" including actions to undo President Biden's electric vehicle mandate, declare a \"national energy emergency,\" and encourage the excavation of America's natural resources, an incoming White House official told reporters Monday morning. He also plans to sign a presidential memorandum on inflation.",
      "And he plans to take action on getting \"wokeness\" out of the military, and to direct the military to begin construction of an Iron Dome-type missile defense shield, Trump said on Sunday.",
      "He is expected to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion policies put in place by the Biden administration.",
      "Trump aslo plans to make public the remaining records relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother, Robert Kennedy, as well as Martin Luther King Jr., and other topics of high public interest.",
      "Immigration and border executive orders",
      "He plans to invoke presidential powers to begin a\u00a0sweeping crackdown on immigration after his\u00a0inauguration\u00a0on Monday, tasking the military with border enforcement, designating cartels and gangs as terrorist groups, shutting down asylum and refugee admissions and attempting to terminate birthright citizenship.  The president will be declaring a national emergency at the southern border and will order the Defense Department to more heavily involve military resources there, tasking officials to deploy additional troops to the border.",
      "He's instructing officials to restart construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, relaunching a massive, multi-billion-dollar government project that he championed during his first term in office, that was halted by President Biden, although he restarted construction in 2023 along the border in Texas, where there were high incidences of illegal entry. During the Trump administration, about 450 miles of barriers were built along the southwest border between 2017 and January 2021.",
      "Birthright citizenship",
      "Trump is directing the federal government to stop recognizing automatic birthright citizenship for children of people who are in the country illegally. The U.S. government has long interpreted the 14th Amendment of the Constitution as granting a right of citizenship for those born on American soil, regardless of their parents' immigration status.",
      "Ending Biden administration immigration initiatives",
      "Other actions related to the border include ending many Biden administration immigration initiatives, suspending refugee admission into the U.S. and branding certain Latin American gangs and cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. The incoming administration plans to invoke the Alien and Sedition Act of 1798 to seek the removal of Tren de Aragua gang members, arguing they are an \"armed force of the Venezuelan government\" conducting a \"predatory incursion and invasion\" into the U.S.",
      "Trump is also expected to direct the Justice Department to seek the death penalty for unauthorized immigrants who murder law enforcement officers or commit capital crimes.",
      "Executive orders focused on the economy",
      "Mr. Trump's executive orders related to energy production and the economy are geared toward cutting regulations criticized as red tape. His orders will include declaring a national emergency related to energy costs for American consumers and putting an end to electric vehicle mandates.",
      "The executive orders will include at least one focused specifically on Alaskan economic and energy production. The state and its natural resources are seen as critical to national security, and the new administration is seeking to boost its liquefied natural gas production for both export and domestic use.",
      "The new president will also sign a presidential memorandum on inflation, directing the government to focus on bringing down rising costs.",
      "Gender and diversity orders",
      "Another set of campaign promises Trump will address on his first day are related to gender \"wokeness\" and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Executive orders will also make it a policy of the federal government to recognize two sexes that cannot be changed: male and female. These definitions would be defined through \"reproductive function,\" as opposed to \"chromosome definition.\"",
      "Mr. Trump will also direct the Office of Management and Budget to coordinate with agencies to terminate all mandates, policies, and programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "This executive order will also include a review of facilities that have been renamed as part of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",

      "Rubio, who has taken hardline positions on China, Iran, Venezuela and Cuba, inherits the position facing a number of global challenges, including Russia's war in Ukraine, persistent violence in the Middle East, China's aggression against Taiwan and its tense relationship with the U.S. Mr. Trump has also suggested using military force or coercion to gain control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. He's floated annexing Canada as the 51st state and has threatened trade wars with U.S. allies.",

      "\"His performance was flawless,\" Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the committee's Republican chairman, said ahead of the confirmation vote.",
      "His confirmation hearing largely focused on U.S. relations with China, which he called \"the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Monday approved a bill known as the Laken Riley Act aimed at expanding the federal government's mandate to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally, as congressional Republicans look to deliver for President Trump as he enters office.",
      "In a 64 to 35 vote, the Senate approved the legislation, with 12 Democrats joining all voting Republicans in favor.  The measure marks the first policy legislation of the new Congress, which the House approved earlier this month before the Senate amended it.",
      "The House will need to approve the Senate's changes before it can head to the president's desk.",
      "The Laken Riley Act, named after a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year, would expand mandatory detention to include noncitizens convicted of or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting, as well as those who admit to committing those crimes. The legislation would also empower state attorneys general who claim their states or residents have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the federal government.",
      "Sen. Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican who sponsored the bill in the Senate, called the legislation a \"targeted, common sense, life-saving bill\" ahead of the vote Monday, urging her colleagues to support the measure.",
      "\"Today we return to common sense, we return to practicality,\" Britt said on the Senate floor. \"If you come here illegally and you commit a crime, you should not be free to roam the streets of this nation. Our children deserve better.\"",
      "Though dozens of Senate Democrats had supported opening debate on the measure earlier this month, many did so while pushing for amendments to the legislation. The Senate approved two Republican-backed amendments, which expanded the legislation's scope to include the assault of a law enforcement officer and crimes that result in the death \"or serious bodily injury of another person\" as grounds for mandatory detention. But a Democratic-led amendment to cut the provision that empowers state attorneys general fell short. In the final procedural hurdle last week, 10 Democrats voted with Republicans.",
      "Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, argued Monday that the bill is not targeted enough, pointing to the conditions for detaining immigrants who are accused of committing a \"very broad set of crimes\" without considering \"how young they are or, more important, whether they're a threat to our communities.\"",
      "The legislation has also sparked questions over whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement could fully enforce this new mandate without more funding, since the agency is currently using roughly 39,000 of 41,000 detention beds funded by Congress. The Department of Homeland Security is mandated under current law to detain noncitizens convicted of certain crimes, including \"aggravated felonies,\" or serious offenses like murder and sexual assault.",
      "Last year, the House also passed the measure, but it stalled in the then-Democratic controlled Senate. But Democrats appeared more willing to engage on the measure after the election. Voters cited immigration as a key issue and delivered Republican victories up and down the ballot. Earlier this month, 48 House Democrats also joined Republicans to approve the measure, up from the 37 who did so last year.",
      "As Republicans made immigration a key platform during the 2024 election and touted plans to address border security with a new GOP trifecta, Democrats have repeatedly cited the breakdown of a bipartisan border deal last year, which came at the urging of Mr. Trump.",

    "summary": "Donald and Melania Trump launched new cryptocurrencies over the weekend. Some experts are advising investors to be cautious.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, got a head start on those plans by debuting new his-and-her meme coins \u2014 \u00a0the $Trump and $Melania coins \u2014 over the weekend. As of Monday afternoon, the day of Mr. Trump's inauguration, the two digital currencies were worth a combined $9.5 billion.",
      "Meme coins, which have no economic or transactional value, are cryptocurrencies linked to internet trends, such as Dogecoin, which was inspired by the image of a shiba inu dog. Dogecoin became a favored cryptocurrency of billionaire Elon Musk, who even named his federal cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, after it.",
      "Mr. Trump announced his cryptocurrency on Friday night, writing on social media that the coin celebrates \"everything we stand for: WINNING!\" The meme coin is being marketed with a picture of Trump holding a fist up superimposed over the words \"FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT,\" a reference to Trump's response to an assassination attempt at a political rally in July.",
      "On Sunday, Melania Trump announced her own meme coin with a black-and-white photo of the First Lady smiling and with her hands clasped in front of her face, as if in thanks.",
      "The new meme coins are a way for Mr. Trump to leverage his online popularity, drawing his supporters to the project, noted Joe McCann, CEO of digital assets investment firm Asymmetric. The products, like Mr. Trump's social media company, tend to attract individual investors, rather than large U.S. institutional firms, who buy shares as a way to show support for the president.",
      "\"Meme coins largely represent communities on the internet represented by a financial asset \u2014 they're the tokenization of internet culture,\" McCann told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Donald Trump is arguably the most popular person on the internet, so by launching a meme coin, members of his community can further gain proximity to him.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to monetize his name with numerous commercial ventures, ranging from a licensing deal for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, that earned him $7.2 million, to a\u00a0$59.99 Bible\u00a0that earned him $300,000 in royalties. He's also recently rolled out Trump-branded sneakers, a \"Fight, Fight, Fight\"-branded perfume and watches.",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump coins.",
      "How much are the Donald and Melania Trump meme coins worth?",
      "As of Monday afternoon, the Trump meme coin had a market cap of $8.3 billion, while Melania Trump's cryptocurrency was valued at $1.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Mr. Trump's meme coin soared after it debuted, hitting a peak of almost $75 each. But the price has shed about 45% of its value since then, settling at about $40 per coin on Monday afternoon. Still, that represents a surge of more than 400% from its initial price, CoinMarketCap data shows.",
      "Melania Trump's meme coin has had a slightly rockier debut, sinking more than 20% to about $5.40 per coin on Monday.",
      "Are $Trump and $Melania real investments?",
      "The Trump meme coin website says the president's cryptocurrency is meant as an expression of support \u2014 not an investment opportunity.",
      "The Melania site describes the meme coins as \"digital collectibles,\" adding that they \"are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract or security of any type.\"",
      "Investors typically scrutinize balance sheets and income statements when deciding where to allocate their funds, while currency traders will examine economic factors like trade flow and GDP growth when placing their investments. But relying on these traditional measures don't work with meme coins because they aren't tied to an underlying asset or economy, experts note.",
      "\"Attempting to use traditional financial models to value a meme coin will fail miserably,\" McCann noted. \"Business schools don't teach students how to measure culture, virality or communities.\"",
      "Are meme coins risky?",
      "Meme coins are a highly volatile corner of the crypto sector that often start as a joke and have no intrinsic value, although they can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Because of those dynamics, their prices are prone sudden and extreme swings.",
      "\"Meme coins are some of the most volatile assets on earth and should be treated with caution and care,\" McCann said.",
      "The site selling the $Trump coin warned buyers that its price \"may be extremely volatile and you may experience substantial losses in connection with a sale or other disposition of Trump Memes.\"",
      "Meme coins gained popularity in 2021 and 2022, but some inexperienced investors were unprepared for digital currencies' extreme volatility, noted Nigel Green, CEO of wealth management firm deVere Group, in an email. As a result, he's advising investors to be cautious before putting their money into the Trump meme coins.",
      "How can you buy the Trump and Melania meme coins?",
      "The meme coins are available to buy on an app called Moonshot, which allows people to buy meme coins with Apple Pay, credit or debit card, cryptocurrency, or payment apps like PayPal and Venmo.",
      "The Trump meme coin website notes that all transactions \"ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. We shall have no responsibility or liability for any Trump Memes that are lost, misplaced or inaccessible.\"",
      "What is the cryptocurrency industry's view?",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin's release, saying it reflects the president's support for an industry that felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. Mr. Trump has promised to usher in crypto-friendly regulations and picked crypto backers for key government positions.",
      "For instance, Mr. Trump has nominated cryptocurrency supporter Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, reinforcing optimism that the new president will deregulate the sector.",
      "Other cryptocurrencies are gaining in value on anticipation that the second Trump administration will benefit the sector. Bitcoin, for instance, soared more than 50% since the November election, surging to a record peak of $109,241 ahead of Mr. Trump's inauguration ceremony.",

      "A significant number of diplomats in leadership roles at the State Department were told to step aside just before President Trump took office, two sources tell CBS News.",
      "The shakeup has affected at least 20 State Department officials, including career diplomats and political appointees serving in leadership roles, who received notification as early as Friday, sources familiar with the personnel changes told CBS News. All of the department's under secretaries and assistant secretaries \u2014 including those leading regional bureaus that coordinate how U.S. foreign relations is conducted in six world regions\u00a0\u2014 have been instructed to step aside, the sources confirmed.",
      "The State Department has not commented.",
      "While it is normal for a new administration to choose its own political appointees for various senior roles within the State Department, the extent and speed at which the current leadership has been terminated \u2014 including career officials \u2014 is shocking, the source said.",
      "Experienced career diplomats have typically remained in senior roles while the new administration's picks for political appointees await Senate confirmation. A whole swath of leadership must now be replaced by foreign and civil service diplomats who don't necessarily have as much senior management experience, the source added.",
      "Among those who were told to step down in advance of Mr. Trump's inauguration include career diplomat John Bass, who has served as the No. 3 official under Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the roles of acting under secretary for political affairs and under secretary for management, and assistant secretary for energy resources Geoff Pyatt, CBS has learned.",
      "In his farewell remarks to the staff crowded in the mezzanine of the State Department on Friday, Blinken said there is \"No finer foreign service officer in this generation than John Bass.\"",
      "The Foreign Service Institute, which oversees the development of foreign service careers, fielded a large volume of calls Friday as it tried to figure out where to reassign individuals affected by the orders, the source said. There is usually a period of a few months during which they may be reassigned to new roles.",
      "There is a feeling of overall confidence among the rank and file about Sen. Marco Rubio, who is expected to be confirmed as secretary of state, sources told CBS News. He has long served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has substantial familiarity with foreign policy and national security. But the speed and large scale of the leadership shakeup, along with Mr. Trump's consistent criticism of the so-called \"deep state,\" have left some staff in the department concerned about who is being brought in to oversee the State Department, and how long Rubio himself may be able to stay in the top job, said one source familiar with the reaction inside the department.",
      "Mr. Trump and Rubio are aligned on many foreign policy areas, including a need to be far tougher on China and Iran, on upholding the recent ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, and the need for a political settlement between Russia and Ukraine to end the war.",
      "The Trump White House announced Monday\u00a0that career ambassador Lisa Kenna will temporarily serve as acting secretary of state until Rubio is confirmed.",
      "Reuters first reported the beginning of the shakeup last week, when three senior career diplomats overseeing the department's workforce and internal coordination were told to step aside.",
      "Editor's note: Bridget Brink, who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, was not among those told to resign immediately. An earlier version of this article said that she was."

    "published": "Mon, 20 Jan 2025 16:53:19 -0500",
    "summary": "National Security Counselors, a public interest law firm, alleges the Department of Government Efficiency is breaking a federal a law.",
    "story": [
      "A sweeping federal cost-cutting effort led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is facing multiple lawsuits, with the litigation coinciding with President Trump's January\u00a0inauguration.",
      "One suit, filed Monday by a public interest law firm called National Security Counselors, claims DOGE is operating as a federal advisory committee. That puts the initiative in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA, which regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, according to the group.",
      "FACA requires these groups to be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee,\" the lawsuit states. The lawsuit was filed shortly after noon Eastern time in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, National Security Counselors told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The law requires that advisory committees are \"objective and accessible to the public,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. General Services Administration.",
      "A coalition representing veterans, public health professionals, teachers and other groups also filed a suit Monday against DOGE, citing FACA and asking a court to block DOGE's activities until it complies with law.",
      "\"The question every American should be asking is 'What are they hiding?'\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organization representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \"DOGE must not be allowed to operate in the shadows without the transparency, oversight, and opportunity for public participation required of any federal department by the law.\"",
      "Neither the Trump campaign nor Elon Musk immediately responded to a request for comment. Ramaswamy is expected to step away from DOGE as he embarks on a campaign for Ohio governor later this month.",
      "DOGE breaking the law?",
      "DOGE, which isn't an official government agency, was tasked by Trump to produce recommendations on trimming federal outlays, with billionaires Musk and Ramaswamy saying they aimed to cut about $500 billion in annual expenditures. The lawsuit claims that DOGE so far appears to have largely appointed three types of people to work on its efforts: tech industry executives, people affiliated with the Trump campaign and his prior administration as well as associates of Musk or Ramaswamy's.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that, as a result, DOGE is in violation of FACA because \"not a single member of DOGE is a federal employee or represents the perspective of federal employees, despite the evidence that DOGE intends to provide recommendations regarding federal employment practices and ways to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\"",
      "It also claims that DOGE is violating the law's mandate that advisory committee meetings must be open to the public, noting that Musk and Ramaswamy have held private meetings with various elected officials, as well as with tech executives.",
      "\"Nobody disputes that there is a huge amount of wasteful spending in the federal government,\" Kel McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our only concern is that DOGE, as it is currently constituted, lacks the expertise to understand how its recommendations will backfire if it pushes federal workers out without understanding why they are there in the first place.",
      "He added, \"Government work is not corporate work, and any recommendations made without that perspective are doomed to fail.\"",
      "The lawsuit's plaintiffs include two men who sent in applications to be hired by DOGE. One, Jerald Lentini, is an attorney for National Security Counselors, while the second, Joshua Erlich, is an attorney who frequently represents federal employees and could represent their viewpoints, the lawsuit notes. Neither has heard back from DOGE about their applications.",
      "\"Plaintiffs conclude that, upon information and belief, neither Lentini nor Erlich, nor anyone similarly situated who would represent the perspectives of federal employees (including national security employees), unions, or accountability and transparency advocates, will be selected for DOGE,\" the lawsuit claims.",

      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican but frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said she is \"so against\" restoring the name Mount McKinley.",
      "\"Because the mountain was named 10,000 years ago by the Native people, the Athabascans in the area, and it is called Denali, which means the great one,\" she said. \"So I would just suggest to President Trump, who wants to make everything great, we already have a great name for it, so we're gonna, we're gonna talk about it. I've already talked to him about it.\"",
      "During the transition, Mr. Trump had vowed to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said last week that she would direct her staff to draft legislation for the renaming that would make it effective on federal maps and administrative policy.",
      "While the name change could be applied for federal references, other nations would have no obligation to follow suit.",
      "In 2015, then-President Barack Obama officially renamed Alaska's Mount McKinley, the nation's highest peak, as Denali, the traditional Native Alaskan name. It had long informally been known in Alaska as Denali, despite the official federal designation being Mount McKinley.",

      "FBI's longtime deputy director, who had been expected to temporarily replace director\u00a0Christopher Wray on an acting basis during the transition into the new Trump administration, says he is retiring. Paul Abbate made the unexpected announcement in an email to senior officials Monday ahead of President Trump's inauguration, CBS News confirmed.",
      "\"When the Director asked me to stay on past my mandatory date for a brief time, I did so to help ensure continuity and the best transition for the FBI. Now, with new leadership inbound, after nearly four years in the deputy role, I am departing the FBI today,\" Abbate wrote in the letter, according to the Associated Press, which obtained a copy of the email.",
      "Abbate had been running the FBI for only one day after Wray stepped down as director on Sunday. Wray was named by Trump during his first term and had been director for more than seven years. He announced his retirement when Trump said he wanted Kash Patel to be the director.",
      "Abbate's email did not say who would replace him atop the bureau during the interim. Following the inauguration, the White House posted a list of acting leaders that said Brian Driscoll will serve as head of the FBI until the position is filled.",
      "Abbate's abrupt departure after 28 years with the FBI creates additional tumult for a law enforcement agency that had already been preparing for upheaval in the event Patel is confirmed. A Trump loyalist, Patel has repeatedly criticized FBI leadership and decision-making and has alarmed Democrats with statements that suggest he would be willing to use the FBI to exact retribution on Trump adversaries.",

      "During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first. Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end. And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud and prosperous and free.",
      "America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before. I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.",
      "But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing and the United States of America. As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, the radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens. While the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair, we now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad.",
      "It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world. We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders, or more importantly, its own people.",
      "Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina, who've been treated so badly. And other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago. Or more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They're raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home any longer. That's interesting.",
      "But we can't let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That's going to change. We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today and will change very quickly.",
      "Our recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom. From this moment on, America's decline is over.",
      "Our liberties and our nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied and we will immediately restore the integrity, competency and loyalty of America's government. Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed to take my life. Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then, and believe even more so now, that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again.",
      "That is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. For American citizens, Jan. 20, 2025, is Liberation Day.",
      "It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country. As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society. Young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban and rural. And, very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states and the popular vote. We won by millions of people.",
      "To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.",

And we will not forget our God.",
      "Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense. First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted. And we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. Under the orders I sign today we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.",
      "As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions. And that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices. And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.",
      "America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have: the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth. And we are going to use it. We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again. And it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.",
      "With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. In other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice. We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the auto workers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote.",
      "I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources.",
      "The American Dream will soon be back and thriving like never before. To restore confidence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand new Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America. Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents. Something I know something about. We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the Constitution and the rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.",
      "This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. This week I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from the military for objecting to the Covid vaccine mandate with full back pay. And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It's going to end immediately. Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission\u2014defeating America's enemies. Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.",
      "We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end. And, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into. My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be. A peacemaker and a unifier. I'm pleased to say that, as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.",
      "America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world. A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. And we will restore the name of the great President William McKinley to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.",
      "He was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States \u2014 the United States, I mean, think of this, spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made. And Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.",
      "Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor and the vitality of history's greatest civilization. So as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy and disease free. The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons. And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.",
      "And it's the lifeblood of a great nation. And, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other. There's no nation like our nation. Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls. Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close. Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted millions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.",
      "Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best. From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steel workers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride. Together they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.",

With your help, we will restore an American promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love. And we love it so much. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child to dreams for their future: I am with you, I will fight for you and I will win for you. And we're going to win like never before.",
      "In recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again. Greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other. Full of compassion, courage and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.",
      "America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith and goodwill. We will be prosperous. We will be proud. We will be strong and we will win like never before. We will not be conquered. We will not be intimidated. We will not be broken. And we will not fail.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump delivered an inaugural address after he was sworn in for a second term Monday, promising that he'll bring the United States into a \"golden age\" and rescue the nation from what he claimed was a \"decline\" wrought by his predecessor's policies.",
      "In his speech, the president invoked familiar themes from the campaign trail, including immigration and the economy, and repeated his attacks on the Justice Department and federal government.",
      "\"National unity is now returning to America and confidence and pride is soaring like never before,\" Mr. Trump said. \"In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God.\"",
      "Following the inauguration, the president is expected to sign a series of executive actions.",
      "Here are the highlights from Mr. Trump's second inaugural address.",
      "\"The golden age of America begins right now\"",
      "The president kicked off his speech with a declaration that \"the golden age of America begins right now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said that under his watch, the nation will \"flourish and be respected again\" around the world and suggested that he would oversee a turnaround from the prior four years.",
      "\"During every single day of the Trump administration, I will very simply put America first,\" he said.",
      "The president also repeated his claims that the Justice Department was weaponized against him and said his \"top priority\" would be creating a country that is \"proud, prosperous and free.\"",
      "Trump rails against U.S. \"decline\"",
      "The president quickly pivoted in his speech to lament the state of the nation under his predecessor's policies. Mr. Trump condemned the U.S. education and health systems, saying, \"My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the American people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed that the government cannot provide basic services, as demonstrated by the devastation in western North Carolina as a result of Hurricane Helene in late September. The president also turned to a familiar topic, the southern border.",
      "\"From this moment on, America's decline is over,\" he said.",
      "Trump recalls assassination attempt",
      "Mr. Trump spoke briefly about the attempted assassination against him that took place during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.",
      "The president declared that he believes his life was spared \"for a reason.\"",
      "\"I was saved by God to make America great again,\" he said.",
      "Mr Trump painted the assassination attempt as part of a series of efforts to stop him from returning to the White House.",
      "\"The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one,\" the president said. \"Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take our freedom and indeed, to take my life.\"",
      "Later in the speech, Mr. Trump said that he defied expectations to return to the White House.",
      "\"Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback, but as you see today, here I am,\" he said. \"The American people have spoken.\"",
      "Executive actions on immigration, energy and trade",
      "Trump used his inauguration address to lay out a series of executive actions that he plans to take now that he has been sworn into office.",
      "On immigration, he said he would declare a national emergency at the southern border, a promise that earned him a standing ovation from those in the Rotunda.",
      "He also said his administration would reinstate the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy that he put in place during his first term and end catch-and-release, the practice of detaining and then releasing migrants with the promise of a future court date.",
      "Mr. Trump said he will also send troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to \"repel\" what he has claimed is an \"invasion,\" and designate drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "\"As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threat and invasions and that is exactly what I am going to do,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he would also direct the members of his Cabinet to tackle inflation and bring down costs. He pledged to declare a \"national energy emergency.\"",
      "\"We will drill, baby, drill,\" he said, another promise met with a standing ovation.",
      "The president reiterated his plans to impose tariffs and taxes on foreign nations to \"enrich our citizens,\" and he said he would issue an executive order aimed at stopping government censorship.",
      "Mr. Trump said that under his administration, the position of the federal government would be that there are two genders: male and female. He also pledged to reinstate U.S. service members who were removed from the military because of objections to the COVID-19 vaccine and provide them back pay.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico, Denali and the Panama Canal",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed that he would change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.",
      "He also said that Denali, the highest mountain peak in North America, would be renamed Mount McKinley.",
      "The U.S. recognized the mountain as Mount McKinley, named for President William McKinley, in 1917. But in 2015, under the Obama administration, it was restored to Denali, the traditional Native Alaskan name.",
      "Alaska's two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, support keeping the name Denali.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated that his administration will seek to reassert control over the Panama Canal.",
      "\"We're taking it back,\" he said.",
      "The U.S. relinquished control of the canal in 1999, and it is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",
      "A U.S. flag on Mars",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration would work to put U.S. astronauts on Mars.",
      "\"We will pursue our Manifest Destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars,\" he said.",
      "The declaration earned a thumbs-up from billionaire Elon Musk, who was seated on the platform along with the CEOs from other technology companies, like Jeff Bezos.",
      "Both Bezos, through his company Blue Origin, and Musk, who owns Space-X, have launched rockets into space.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is planning to invoke muscular presidential powers to begin a sweeping crackdown on immigration following his inauguration on Monday, tasking the military with border enforcement, designating cartels and gangs as terrorist groups, shutting down asylum and refugee admissions and attempting to terminate birthright citizenship.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to issue around 10 executive actions on his first day in office to start reshaping federal immigration and border policy, many of which are expected to face significant legal challenges, incoming administration officials said on a call with reporters on Monday morning.",
      "\"As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is what I'm going to do,\" Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address.",
      "Here are the executive actions Mr. Trump is planning to take on immigration and border policy:",
      "A national emergency to increase military presence at the border",
      "Mr. Trump is planning to declare a national emergency at the southern border, the officials said. He will order the Department of Defense to more heavily involve the vast resources and manpower of the U.S. military at the border, tasking officials to deploy additional troops there.",
      "For over the past decades, the U.S. military has had a presence along the U.S.-Mexico border, mostly to provide operational assistance to Customs and Border Protection.",
      "An \"end\" to asylum, and restarting border wall construction and \"Remain in Mexico\"",
      "Mr. Trump is instructing officials to restart construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, relaunching a massive, multi-billion-dollar government project that had been halted by President Biden. During the Trump administration, about 450 miles of barriers were built along the southwest border.",
      "Federal agencies will be ordered to begin the process of reinstating the so-called \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which requires migrants to wait for their asylum hearings on the Mexican side of the border. President Biden's administration suspended that policy soon after taking office, though it was forced to revive it briefly due to a court order. Reviving the program would require the consent of the Mexican government, which has not yet publicly agreed to it.",
      "Mr. Trump is also set to cite his presidential powers to \"end\" asylum by proclamation, allowing for fast-track deportations at the U.S.-Mexico border, officials said.",
      "Existing rules issued by the Biden administration in June already disqualify most migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally from asylum. That policy, alongside Mexico's efforts to slow U.S.-bound migration, has been credited for the current four-year-low in illegal border crossings.",
      "Labeling gangs, cartels as terrorist groups",
      "Mr. Trump is designating cartels and international gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, seeking to penalize the groups that largely control the illicit movement of migrants and drugs across the U.S. southern border. The gangs include the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and MS-13, which originated in U.S. cities before spreading to Central America.",
      "The incoming administration plans to invoke the Alien and Sedition Act of 1798 to seek the removal of Tren de Aragua gang members, officials said, arguing they are an \"armed force of the Venezuelan government\" conducting a \"predatory incursion and invasion\" into the U.S.",
      "An attempt to end birthright citizenship",
      "Mr. Trump is planning to attempt to deny birthright citizenship to the children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, according to the incoming officials. The U.S. government has long interpreted the U.S. Constitution to mean that those born on American soil are citizens at birth, regardless of their parents' immigration status.",
      "The 14th Amendment to the Constitution says: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "A pause in refugee admissions",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to suspend refugee admissions into the U.S. for at least 4 months.",
      "The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program allows certain refugees fleeing persecution and war to come to the U.S. legally after rounds of interviews, security vetting and medical screenings. The Biden administration had rebuilt refugee admissions after they fell to a record low at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to travel limits and drastic Trump-era cuts to the program.",
      "Shutting down Biden administration immigration programs",
      "Mr. Trump is planning to issue an order rescinding Biden administration programs. Although they were not described in the call, they likely include a phone app that allows asylum-seekers in Mexico to request entry into the U.S. and an initiative that allowed migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to fly to the U.S. if they had American sponsors. Both policies were designed to curb illegal immigration by offering would-be migrant legal alternatives to crossing the southern border illegally.",
      "The U.S. government estimates that around 270,000 migrants are currently in Mexico, trying to get an appointment to enter the U.S. through the app, known as CBP One, according to CBS News reporting. The incoming Trump administration swiftly shut down the app once Mr. Trump was sworn in, with a message on its website saying \"existing appointments have been cancelled.\"",
      "Other actions",
      "Officials said Mr. Trump will direct the attorney general to seek the death penalty for unauthorized immigrants who murder law enforcement officers or commit \"capital\" crimes.",
      "Mr. Trump is also assigning agencies to issue suggestions for further restrictions on immigration from countries of \"particular concern.\"",

    "story": [
      "With just moments left before he leaves office, President Joe Biden commuted the life sentence of indigenous activist Leonard Peltier, who was convicted in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents.",
      "Peltier was denied parole as recently as July and wasn't eligible for parole again until 2026. He was serving life in prison for the deaths of the agents during a standoff on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. He will transition to home confinement, Biden said in a statement.",
      "\"President Biden took an enormous step toward healing and reconciliation with the Native American people in this country,\" Peltier's former attorney Kevin Sharp said in a statement Monday. \"It took nearly 50 years to acknowledge the injustice of Leonard Peltier's conviction and continued incarceration, but with the president's act of mercy Leonard can finally return to his reservation and live out his remaining days.\"",
      "Sharp, a former chief judge of the federal U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, represented Peltier for five years and filed petitions for clemency, which does not change Peltier's conviction, on his behalf in 2019 and 2021.",
      "The fight for Peltier's freedom is entangled with the Indigenous rights movements. Nearly half a century later, his name remains a rallying cry.",
      "An enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa in North Dakota, Peltier was active in the American Indian Movement, which began in the 1960s as a local organization in Minneapolis that grappled with issues of police brutality and discrimination against Native Americans. It quickly became a national force.",
      "The movement grabbed headlines in 1973 when it took over the village of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge reservation, leading to a 71-day standoff with federal agents. Tensions between the movement and the government remained high for years.",
      "On June 26, 1975, agents came to Pine Ridge to serve arrest warrants amid battles over Native treaty rights and self-determination.",
      "After being injured in a shootout, agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were shot in the head at close range, FBI has said. Also killed in the shootout was American Indian Movement member Joseph Stuntz.",
      "Two other movement members, Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted of killing Coler and Williams.",
      "After fleeing to Canada and being extradited to the United States, Peltier was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced in 1977 to life in prison, despite defense claims that evidence against him had been falsified.",
      "The FBI, which has long opposed Peltier's release, released a letter Monday that then-Director Christoper Wray wrote to Biden earlier this month opposing a pardon or commutation for Peltier.",
      "\"Even though courts have repeatedly examined and exposed Peltier's claims as baseless, his sympathizers continue to wrongly promote him as a standard-bearer for legitimate grievances about the United States government's historical mistreatment of Native Americans,\" Wray said in the letter. \"But the facts cannot \u2014 and must not \u2014 be ignored. Peltier is a ruthless murderer who has shown a complete lack of remorse for his many crimes.\"",

      "Trump, who has long opposed clean energy and EV subsidies, has said the U.S. needs to increase traditional oil and gas production in order to reduce energy prices for Americans, a theme he reiterated in his inauguration speech on Monday.",

      "The president noted that the pardons \"should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.\" He added that the nation instead \"owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.\"",
      "Mr. Biden praised the service of Fauci, who worked for decades as the nation's top infectious disease expert; Milley, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the members of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and their staff, who the president said worked with \"integrity and a commitment to discovering the truth.\" The individuals have all been the subject of GOP ire and threats of retribution for perceived wrongdoings.",

Let me be perfectly clear: I have committed no crime and there are no possible grounds for any allegation or threat of criminal investigation or prosecution of me. The fact is, however, that the mere articulation of these baseless threats, and the potential that they will be acted upon, create immeasurable and intolerable distress for me and my family.\"",

      "Speculation about the possibility of preemptive pardons for members of the Jan. 6 committee has circulated in recent days.

Hunter Biden was\u00a0convicted in June of three separate felony charges\u00a0related to his purchase of a revolver in 2018 when he was battling an addiction to illegal drugs, which he lied about on paperwork to obtain the gun. He also pleaded guilty to\u00a0nine tax evasion charges\u00a0in a separate case in September.",
      "Thompson\u00a0told CBS News last week that he would accept a preemptive pardon, saying that \"if for Bennie Thompson, that is something that's offered to me, I will accept it.\"",
      "\"Because there are a lot of people who take this person at his word, and I don't want him to weaponize (the) government against people for doing their job,\" Thompson said.",
      "Still, other members of the committee have said they were not in favor of pardons. \"We didn't do anything wrong,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar, a Democrat of California.",
      "Former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said he understands \"understand the theory behind it because Donald Trump has clearly said he's going to go after everybody,\" but he added \"the second you take a pardon, it looks like you're guilty of something.\"",
      "\"I'm guilty of nothing besides bringing the truth to the American people and in the process, embarrassing Donald Trump,\" Kinzinger told CNN.",
      "The panel's other Republican, former Rep. Liz Cheney, had been the subject of Trump's ire since her work on the committee, with Trump successfully backing a primary challenger. During the campaign, Trump called her a \"war hawk\" and a \"stupid person,\" and said \"let's see how she feels about it, you know when the guns are trained on her face.\"",
      "Mr. Biden awarded Cheney and Thompson with the Presidential Citizens Medal, the second-highest civilian award, at a ceremony at the White House this month.",

    "summary": "Billionaires' wealth soared in 2024, a top anti-poverty group said ahead of an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland of some of the world's political and financial elite.",
    "story": [
      "Davos, Switzerland \u2014 Billionaires' wealth grew three times faster in 2024 than the year before, a top anti-poverty group reported on Monday as some of the world's political and financial elite prepared for an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Biden last week of a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\" The group's sharp-edged report, titled \"Takers Not Makers,\" also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",
      "The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation - including his own - and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\"What you're seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\" Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\"It's not about one specific individual. It's the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\" he added.",
      "Like Biden's call for making billionaires \"begin to pay their fair share\" through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam - a global advocacy group - called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \"dismantle the new aristocracy.\"",
      "The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay \"living wages\" to workers.",
      "Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said.",
      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \"barely changed\" since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes' \"Real-Time Billionaire List\" as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \"minted\" every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \"crony connections,\" it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \"Global Risks Report,\" which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \"societal polarization\" - a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",
      "As in past years, protesters calling for more economic equality, taxing the rich and pressing other demands took to the streets.",
      "Some blocked roads to Davos, snarling traffic in places and delaying trips for some attendees to the event, which runs through Friday.",

      "\"Vice President-elect Vance and Vice President Han discussed a range of topics including fentanyl, balancing trade, and regional stability,\" the transition said in a statement.",
      "Han is one of several foreign officials expected to attend Trump's inauguration, along with Argentina President Javier Milei, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and the wife of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, since he is unable to leave the country. According to State Department records dating back to 1874, a foreign leader has never attended a transfer-of-power ceremony.",
      "Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told CBS News in December that Trump had invited Xi to the inauguration. She told Fox News on Thursday that it is an example of Trump \"creating an open dialogue with\u00a0 leaders of countries that are not just our allies but our adversaries and our competitors too.\"",
      "The outreach to Chinese officials comes as other expected members of the Trump administration, including Sen. Marco Rubio, his pick to be Secretary of State, have been critical of the Chinese government. During Rubio's confirmation hearing last week, he called China \"the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.\"",
      "In addition, ByteDance, the Chinese owners of TikTok, over the weekend restricted access to its wildly popular app in the U.S. over a law set to effect Sunday intended to force ByteDance to divest from the company. The app went dark in the U.S. late Saturday, but was replaced by a message saying that they are \"fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"",
      "Trump on Sunday posted on social media that he would issue an executive order to extend the period of time before the law takes effect, and the app was reinstated on Sunday for American users.",

    "summary": "Experts discuss the increased intensity we can expect from destructive weather events due to climate change, while an amateur meteorologist explains how he helped sound the alarm as wildfires spread towards the L.A. County community of Altadena.",
    "story": [
      "The monster that roared through L.A. County last week is still alive \u2013 but firefighters seem to have it cornered. People have started returning to their homes, or what's left of them. Insurance, if they had it, is a whole other battle.",
      "The focus now is turning from what happened to why it happened, and what in the world is next? \u00a0 This disaster is as bad as just about anybody here can remember \u2026 but is it really just the new normal?",
      "John Vaillant, author of \"Fire Weather: On the Front Lines of a Burning World,\" said, \"Nature is telling us, 'I can't take this anymore. I cannot support you if you keep treating me this way.'\"",
      "Vaillant says climate change is making disasters like the wind-driven L.A. fires even fiercer. \"We can expect fires of this intensity, and worse, in the future,\" he said. \"The types of fires we've seen over the past ten years are qualitatively different from the previous hundred years.\"",
      "\"The types of fires are different?\" I asked. \"How has fire changed?\"",
      "\"In a number of ways. The most potent and frightening way, the most obvious to the layperson, people like us, is it moves faster and with greater intensity. When you talk to any firefighter with any sense of history, they are seeing different [fire] behavior that is, in many cases, un-fightable.\"",
      "And Vaillant says the cause is something science has been telling us for decades: the CO2 that our combustion engines keep pumping into the atmosphere. \"We don't feel it; we don't smell it; we don't notice it,\" he said. \"But if you were to take the car engine that brought me here and set it up on the floor here and fired it up, we would go deaf, and then we would die from its emissions.\u00a0 And that's under the hood of every internal combustion engine car. And there are hundreds of millions of them. So, the emissions from fire, these trillions of fires that we make every day, has created this artificially warm climate.\"",
      "And so, he says, we get more intense fires \u2026 stronger hurricanes \u2026 and hotter heatwaves.",

      "Kalmus learned that firsthand last year, when North Carolina was trashed by Hurricane Helene. And the California fires were a disaster for him as well; his old house in Altadena, and his friends' homes, all burned to the ground. He said, \"I am hopeful that, if there's a silver lining to this tragedy, it's that, you know, the public will wake up and get angry and say, 'We need to do something about this.

      "Climate chaos: Extreme heat, wildfires and record-setting storms suggest a frightening future is already here",
      "Scientists like Kalmus have been warning the world about impending climate disaster for years now. But on January 6, as the fire closed in on Altadena, perhaps the most effective warning came from an amateur meteorologist.",
      "Edgar McGregor has been picking up trash in Altadena every day for more than five years. He's also into meteorology, and runs a Facebook page about weather. Days before the fires even started, he warned his Facebook followers about dangerous conditions, and on January 6, he posted a video telling them to drop everything and get out of town.",
      "\"I said, 'Get out,'\" McGregor explained. \"I stood in the middle of my street at home, filmed myself with the mountains on fire behind me and told people, 'This is serious. Get your Social Security cards. Get the deed to your home. Get out. Like, this is the Big One. I'm not joking around. This is not gonna blow over.'\"",
      "Jenn Siebert, an Altadena mother of two, didn't need to hear that twice. \"I think he, well, he definitely saved my family's lives,\" she said. \"We all listened to him. We were like, 'This kid knows what he's talking about!'\"",
      "Her own house somehow survived; her neighbors weren't so lucky. \"My best friends, like, they've lost everything,\" Siebert said. \"They're alive, because, probably because of Edgar, I would imagine. Everybody in the Beautiful Altadena group is alive because of Edgar, right now.\"",
      "Siebert, who had never met McGregor in person, embraced him when she was introduced. \"I'm so appreciative of you,\" she said. \"You saved my family and you saved so many people. So, thank you.\"",
      "The fires, experts say, are a warning on a much bigger scale, that the Earth will continue to get drier and more volatile unless we do something about climate change. But of course, warnings only work when people listen.",
      "I asked Vaillant, \"Have we just pushed Nature too far?\"",
      "\"The upside to all of this is, Nature is inviting us, sternly, to reengage,\" he replied. \"It's only going to get hotter. And so, Nature is saying, 'Wake up! We are in this together.' It behooves all of us to focus on the real causes, and to understand that this really can happen to us, to us, to you and to me, not just to people we know, or people on TV.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 07:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists analyzing 2,000-year-old DNA have revealed that a Celtic society in the southern U.K. during the Iron Age was centered around women, a study said.",
    "story": [
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\"That was really jaw-dropping \u2014 it's never been observed before in European prehistory,\" said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2014 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \"it's your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife's family for land and livelihood,\" said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2014 called matrilocality \u2014 is historically rare.",
      "\"Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines,\" the authors write in an article accompanying the study.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2014 women leaving their homes to join their husband's family group \u2014 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives' extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain's Celtic society \"more egalitarian than the Roman world,\" said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",
      "\"When the Romans arrived, they were astonished to find women occupying positions of power,\"\u00a0 Russell said.",
      "Some had doubted these accounts, suggesting \"that the Romans exaggerated the liberties of British women to paint a picture of an untamed society,\" he told AFP.",
      "\"But archaeology, and now genetics, implies women were influential in many spheres of Iron Age life,\" he said.",
      "\"Indeed, it is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:08:29 -0500",
    "summary": "If the weather cooperates, the Starship launch will follow the maiden flight of Jeff Bezos' already weather-delayed New Glenn rocket.",
    "story": [
      "After launching more than 100 small payloads from California on Tuesday and two commercial moon landers from Florida early Wednesday, both atop Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship for a ground-shaking launch from the Texas Gulf Coast to kick off the program's seventh test flight.",
      "But bad weather prompted the California rocket builder to delay the high-profile flight to Thursday, when it will follow a NASA spacewalk outside the International Space Station and the launch of Jeff Bezos' New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight.",
      "The New Glenn is scheduled for its own weather-delayed liftoff from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1 a.m. EST, the opening of a three-hour launch window.",
      "Six hours later, space station astronauts Nick Hague and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams plan to venture outside the NASA lab complex for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk starting around 8 a.m. to carry out a variety of maintenance and upgrade tasks.",
      "That will set the stage for the Super Heavy-Starship launch from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility at 5 p.m. EST, weather permitting.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff using 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. The New Glenn rocket, built by Bezos' space company Blue Origin, is not nearly as powerful, but it will compete head-to-head with SpaceX's industry-dominating Falcon 9-family rockets.",
      "Like the Falcon 9's first stage, the New Glenn booster is reusable, and Blue Origin will attempt to recover its first stage with touchdown on an offshore landing ship. The rocket's upper stage will continue into orbit where flight controllers will carry out a series of tests. Additional flights are planned later this year.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship has a more ambitious agenda befitting its gargantuan size.",
      "As with the two most recent test flights, the first stage will boost the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere before falling away and heading back to the launch site for recovery. The Starship, meanwhile, will continue to space on the power of six Raptor engines of its own.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For the third flight in a row, SpaceX planned an attempt to \"catch\" the Super Heavy first stage after it propelled the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, snagging it on the way down using giant mechanical arms known as chopsticks mounted on the launch tower.",
      "The first such catch  last October was successful, a spectacular sight to thousands of  cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later  was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to  sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending  booster into position.",
      "New sensors now have more robust shielding to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets.",
      "But the bulk of the upgrades being tested Thursday are built into what SpaceX calls a \"new generation\" Starship. Multiple systems have been modified to improve performance and to test systems needed for eventual stage recovery.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",

    "summary": "A fire in the aft section of SpaceX's Starship trigged the apparent explosion that destroyed the spacecraft, the company says.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered SpaceX to carry out a formal investigation into the breakup of its Starship rocket during a test flight Thursday that sent a spectacular shower of flaming debris plummeting back to Earth, the agency announced Friday.",
      "\"The FAA is requiring SpaceX to perform a mishap investigation into the loss of the Starship vehicle during launch operations on Jan. 16,\" the FAA said in a statement. \"There are no reports of public injury, and the FAA is working with SpaceX and appropriate authorities to confirm reports of public property damage on Turks and Caicos.\"",
      "Within minutes of the Starship's breakup, along with videos posted on social media showing a shower of debris from a sudden fireball \u2014 possibly propellants igniting in the wake of the failure \u2014 the FAA activated a \"Debris Response Area\" and \"briefly slowed aircraft outside the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\"",
      "Other aircraft were briefly held up at South Florida airports and several \"requested to divert due to low fuel levels while holding outside impacted areas,\" the agency said.",
      "SpaceX, meanwhile, said initial data indicated a fire broke out in the rear part of the Starship, triggering the vehicle's destruction.",
      "\"The Starship upper stage successfully lit all six Raptor engines and performed its ascent burn to space,\" the company said on its web page. \"Prior to the burn's completion, telemetry was lost with the vehicle after approximately eight and a half minutes of flight. Initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly.\"",
      "A \"rapid unscheduled disassembly,\" or RUD, is a description favored by SpaceX founder Elon Musk when referring to catastrophic rocket failures. SpaceX set up a \"debris hotline\" at 1-866-623-0234 and urged anyone who finds Starship wreckage to call or notify the company at recovery@spacex.com.",
      "Mishap occurred during test flight",
      "The mishap occurred during the seventh test flight of a giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket from SpaceX's Gulf Coast manufacturing and flight test center at Boca Chica, Texas.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage chalked up a successful mission, boosting the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, then flipping around and flying back to seaside firing stand where it was plucked out of mid air by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower.",
      "The Starship, meanwhile, continued toward space on the power of its six engines. But about eight-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, telemetry shared on SpaceX's webcast showed the engines shutting down in a staggered fashion before data suddenly froze and stopped updating.",
      "Numerous photos and videos posted on social media showed smoking debris trails fanning out from a fireball in the late afternoon sky in a scene reminiscent of the shuttle Columbia's breakup in 2003 and the Russian Mir space station's intentional re-entry and disintegration in 2001.",
      "The mishap Thursday is not expected to impact SpaceX's commercial operations. The company dominates the commercial launch industry with its partially reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets launched from Florida and California and those boosters do not share any common elements with the Starship.",
      "But Musk views the Super Heavy-Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, as the future of the company, with both stages designed to fly themselves to rocket-powered landings for rapid refurbishment and re-launch, a key element in the company's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "SpaceX is in the process of ramping up test flights to quickly verify performance, test new ideas, identify problem areas and implement fixes in downstream flights.",
      "How the FAA-mandated investigation might affect the test schedule is not yet known.",
      "\"A mishap investigation is designed to enhance public safety, determine the root cause of the event and identify corrective actions to avoid it from happening again,\" the FAA said.",
      "\"The FAA will be involved in every step of the SpaceX-led mishap investigation process and must approve SpaceX's final report, including any corrective actions. A return to flight is based on the FAA determining that any system, process  or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety.\"",
      "How long the investigation might take -- and when the Super Heavy-Starship might fly again -- is not yet known. But it almost certainly will stretch out SpaceX's test program.",
      "Going into Thursday's test flight, SpaceX said 2025 \"will be transformational for Starship with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",
      "Getting the Super Heavy-Starship flying on a regular basis is critical to NASA's Artemis moon program. NASA is paying SpaceX to develop a variant of the Starship upper stage to carry astronauts down to the lunar surface in 2027.",
      "To send a Starship to the moon, SpaceX must first launch it to low-Earth orbit where a succession of other Starship \"tankers\" will have to rendezvous, dock and autonomously refuel the moon-bound ship so it can blast out of Earth orbit and head for deep space.",
      "Astronauts launched by NASA's Space Launch System rocket then will rendezvous with the Starship in lunar orbit and then descend to the surface.",
      "NASA's contract requires one unpiloted lunar landing test flight before astronauts can be cleared to ride one down to the surface. The ongoing test program will determine when that might be possible.",

      "New sensors with have more robust shielding were put in place to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets, a key element in SpaceX's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "In keeping with the reusability theme, the Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines included one that flew on a previous test flight to demonstrate its ability to fly multiple missions.",
      "The bulk of the upgrades tested Thursday were built into what SpaceX called a \"new generation\" Starship. Two minutes after the booster \"landed,\" the upper stage reached space.",
      "But the loss of telemetry left flight controllers in the dark about what might have happened in the final stages of the ascent.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly-first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For Thursday's flight, major test objectives included restarting a Raptor engine in space and the deployment of 10 dummy Starlink mockups to test a new satellite delivery system that works a bit like a Pez candy dispenser. Starships are expected to launch thousands of Starlinks after the rocket is operational.",
      "Among the other upgrades were smaller stabilizing fins, repositioned to reduce their exposure to re-entry heating, an improved propulsion avionics system, redesigned fuel feed lines and a 25% increase in propellant volume to improve performance.",
      "The redesigned avionics system includes a more powerful flight computer, new antennas that combine signals from Starlink and GPS navigation satellites, \"smart batteries\" and power units to drive two dozen high-voltage actuators and redesigned navigation sensors.",
      "SpaceX also added additional cameras, with more than 30 on board to provide direct views of critical systems using operational Starlink satellites to stream real-time video and data to the ground.",
      "While the spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, SpaceX has not yet made any attempts to capture a returning Starship or, for that matter, a Falcon 9 upper stage.",
      "But Thursday's test flight featured multiple experiments to test a variety of heat shield improvements, including metallic tiles and one with active cooling, along with dummy Starship catch fittings, to learn more about how they will respond to re-entry heating.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",
      "Getting the Super Heavy-Starship flying on a regular basis is critical to NASA's Artemis moon program. NASA is paying SpaceX to develop a variant of the Starship upper stage to carry astronauts down to the lunar surface in the 2027 timeframe.",
      "To send a Starship to the moon, SpaceX must first launch it to low-Earth orbit where a succession of other Starship \"tankers\" will have to rendezvous, dock and autonomously refuel the moon-bound ship so it can blast out of Earth orbit and head for deep space.",
      "Astronauts launched in an Orion capsule atop NASA's Space Launch System rocket then will rendezvous with the Starship in orbit around the moon for the descent to the surface.",
      "NASA's contract requires one unpiloted lunar landing test flight before astronauts can be cleared to ride one down to the surface. The ongoing test program will determine when that might be possible.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 09:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Despite losing its booster during a landing attempt, the upper stage reached orbit as planned.",
    "story": [
      "Shrugging off bad weather, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched its powerful New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight early Thursday, lighting up a cloudy overnight sky as it climbed away from Cape Canaveral in a high-stakes bid to compete with Elon Musk's industry-leading SpaceX.",
      "Like SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9, the New Glenn's first stage was designed to fly itself to a landing on a Blue Origin recovery ship after boosting the upper stage out of the lower atmosphere. Reusability is a key element in Bezos' drive to compete with Musk on the high frontier.",
      "The booster did it's job propelling the upper stage into the lower reaches of space. But during its descent to a planned landing on the recovery ship Jacklyn, named after Bezos' mother, telemetry and video from the rocket froze.",
      "\"We may very well have lost the booster,\" a company commentator said.",
      "The company later confirmed that. But recovering the first stage was always a secondary objective. The New Glenn's upper stage reached orbit without any apparent problems, achieving the primary goal of the flight.",
      "\"We did it! Orbital,\" company CEO Dave Limp said on X. \"Great night for Team Blue. On to spring and trying again on the landing.\"",
      "As for the booster, Limp said \"we knew landing our booster ... on the first try was an ambitious goal. We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring. Thank you to all of Team Blue for this incredible milestone.\"",
      "The mission got underway at 2:03 a.m. EST when the New Glenn's seven methane-burning BE-4 engines at the base of the first stage roared to life with a rush of brilliant flame and a ground-shaking roar.",
      "Smoothly accelerating as it consumed propellants and lost weight, the  New Glenn streaked away from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force  Station atop a brilliant blue-white plume, putting on a spectacular show for  cheering Blue Origin employees, area residents and tourists.",
      "The launch came a week later than originally planned because of rough weather in the booster landing zone and, once, because of a minor technical problem. But it appeared to be clear sailing Thursday as the rocket climbed away and disappeared from view.",
      "Three minutes and 10 seconds after liftoff, the rocket's first stage engines shut down, triggering stage separation and ignition of the two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines powering the rocket's second stage.",
      "As the upper stage continued the climb to orbit, the first stage briefly coasted upward before arcing over and falling back to Earth, homing in on the Jacklyn, which was standing by several hundred miles downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. NASA's WB-57 photo-reconnaissance jet was flying nearby, documenting the flight with high-resolution cameras.",
      "Three engines re-ignited as planned to slow the booster for re-entry but during the burn, video showing one of the engines froze and on-screen telemetry stopped while showing an altitude of 84,226 feet and a velocity of 4,285 mph. Whether the rocket exploded or suffered some other malfunction and crashed into the sea was not immediately known.",
      "But company officials said before launch that they would learn from any anomalies and press ahead with another flight in the next few months.",
      "\"We have another one (in production), and it'll be coming off the line here shortly,\" Limp told CBS News earlier this week. \"So we'll fly (again) either way in the spring.\"",
      "While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin opted to make the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. That was based in part on the company's experience launching and landing its sub-orbital New Shepard rocket, used to carry space tourists, researchers and payloads on brief up-and-down flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "Even so, company officials acknowledged the challenge, naming the New Glenn first stage \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "\"There's no question that it's a bit audacious to try to land it the first time,\" Limp said before launch.",
      "But the first stage landing was just one of several major objectives. The primary goal of the flight was to put the upper stage into orbit, along with a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as the Blue Ring Pathfinder. A sort of space tug, the Blue Ring can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing on-board computer support and even servicing.",
      "For its initial flight, the Blue Ring was to remain attached to the New Glenn's upper stage throughout the planned five-hour 50-minute mission.",
      "The flight plan called for two firings of the upper stage engines, with the second coming about an hour after liftoff, to put the vehicle and the attached Blue Ring Pathfinder in an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet. It features 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other instruments weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck.",
      "There are no such payloads on the initial flight, but the spacecraft's systems will undergo a series of tests to learn more about how the craft performs in space.",
      "Regardless of the results of Thursday's mission, Blue Origin will face an uphill battle with SpaceX, which currently dominates the commercial launch market.",
      "Musk had kind words about the launch in a post on his X platform, saying, \"Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!\"",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and since then has fired off 436 Falcon 9-family missions with only two in-flight failures.",
      "Complicating the picture for Blue Origin, SpaceX is in the process of testing a gargantuan, fully reusable rocket known as the Super Heavy-Starship. It is the most powerful rocket ever built, and once operational is expected to play a major role in launching payloads to low-Earth orbit, the moon and beyond.",
      "SpaceX plans to launch a Super Heavy-Starship from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test center on Thursday at 5 p.m. EST.",
      "After boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, the Super Heavy booster is designed to fly back to its launch pad, where giant mechanical arms would attempt to pluck it out of mid-air. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, would loop around the planet, launching 10 mockup Starlink satellites before a simulated landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Some 225 Falcon 9 flights have launched 7,700 Starlink internet satellites since 2019, with thousands more planned. The company already has millions of customers around the world, giving it a formidable head start over potential competitors.",
      "How Blue Origin and other rocket builders will complete with SpaceX, it's Falcon-family rockets and the Super Heavy-Starship remains to be seen.",
      "But Blue Origin already has a backlog of satellites awaiting launch on its New Glenn and is awaiting certification to launch high-priority national security payloads, NASA probes and other civilian satellites.",
      "Amazon plans to launch more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper to provide space-based internet services in direct competition with SpaceX's Starlink.",
      "Blue Origin says it has booked 80 launches using New Glenn rockets and boosters provided by the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"I'm very bullish about space in general,\" Limp said. \"I think there's going to be lots of winners in this segment. It might be SpaceX; I think Blue will be there. But I also believe there's going to be new companies that we've never even heard of yet. There's some entrepreneur out there that hasn't started a space company that's going to be at the table.\"",

    "summary": "If the weather cooperates, the Starship launch will follow the maiden flight of Jeff Bezos' already weather-delayed New Glenn rocket.",
    "story": [
      "After launching more than 100 small payloads from California on Tuesday and two commercial moon landers from Florida early Wednesday, both atop Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship for a ground-shaking launch from the Texas Gulf Coast to kick off the program's seventh test flight.",
      "But bad weather prompted the California rocket builder to delay the high-profile flight to Thursday, when it will follow a NASA spacewalk outside the International Space Station and the launch of Jeff Bezos' New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight.",
      "The New Glenn is scheduled for its own weather-delayed liftoff from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1 a.m. EST, the opening of a three-hour launch window.",
      "Six hours later, space station astronauts Nick Hague and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams plan to venture outside the NASA lab complex for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk starting around 8 a.m. to carry out a variety of maintenance and upgrade tasks.",
      "That will set the stage for the Super Heavy-Starship launch from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility at 5 p.m. EST, weather permitting.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff using 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. The New Glenn rocket, built by Bezos' space company Blue Origin, is not nearly as powerful, but it will compete head-to-head with SpaceX's industry-dominating Falcon 9-family rockets.",
      "Like the Falcon 9's first stage, the New Glenn booster is reusable, and Blue Origin will attempt to recover its first stage with touchdown on an offshore landing ship. The rocket's upper stage will continue into orbit where flight controllers will carry out a series of tests. Additional flights are planned later this year.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship has a more ambitious agenda befitting its gargantuan size.",
      "As with the two most recent test flights, the first stage will boost the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere before falling away and heading back to the launch site for recovery. The Starship, meanwhile, will continue to space on the power of six Raptor engines of its own.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For the third flight in a row, SpaceX planned an attempt to \"catch\" the Super Heavy first stage after it propelled the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, snagging it on the way down using giant mechanical arms known as chopsticks mounted on the launch tower.",
      "The first such catch  last October was successful, a spectacular sight to thousands of  cheering residents and tourists.

    "story": [
      "With the nearly full moon shining overhead, two companies, one American and the other headquartered in Japan, launched privately developed robotic lunar landers early Wednesday, sharing a sky-lighting ride to space atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "The U.S. lander, built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and known as \"Blue Ghost,\" is carrying 10 sophisticated instruments for NASA while the Japanese spacecraft, built by Tokyo-based ispace and known as \"Resilience,\" is carrying four instruments of its own and a small microrover known as \"Tenacious.\"",
      "Mounted one atop the other in the nose cone of the Falcon 9, liftoff from historic pad 39A came on time at 1:11 a.m. EST Wednesday. Blue Ghost, weighing 1,033 pounds without propellant, was released to fly on its own one hour and five minutes after liftoff.",
      "Resilience, which weighs about 750 pounds, was deployed 21 minutes later, after the Falcon 9 carried out a final second stage engine firing to put the craft on a different trajectory.",
      "\"Our customers have different strategies for arriving to the moon, and Falcon 9's abilities enable us to deliver each lander to their respective injection orbits to complete their missions,\" said Julianna Scheiman, a senior SpaceX manager.",
      "The landers are taking very different routes to the moon. Blue Ghost is expected to spend about 25 days in Earth orbit, giving Firefly engineers time to thoroughly check out the craft's instruments, propulsion and other subsystems. The craft then will fire its engines for a four-day trip to the moon, followed by 16 days in lunar orbit.",
      "If no major problems develop, Blue Ghost, 6.6 feet tall and 11.5 feet wide, then will descend to the surface near the center of Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 touching down on four shock-absorbing legs. Its 10 science instruments will have two full weeks, or a lunar \"day,\" to collect data.",
      "\"The research we gather will help unlock future space exploration, while also benefiting life on Earth, with new insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect our planet,\" said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",
      "\"Each milestone we complete will provide valuable data for future missions and ultimately keep the United States and our international partners at the forefront of space exploration.\"",
      "Unlike Blue Ghost, ispace's Resilience, also known as Hakuto-R, will head for the moon about two days after launch, using a low-energy fuel-saving trajectory. One month later, the craft will fly past the moon, using its gravity to adjust the flight path before entering orbit about four months after launch. Two weeks after that, Resilience will attempt its own landing at Mare Frigoris, the Sea of Cold.",
      "ispace launched its first Hakuto lander in late 2022, but flight controllers lost contact the following March as the spacecraft was nearing the moon's surface.",
      "Investigators later determined the onboard software misinterpreted the lander's altitude after flying over the rim of a crater. The vehicle subsequently ran out of propellant and crashed to the surface.",
      "That problem has been corrected, ispace says, prompting the company to name its second Hakuto lander \"Resilience.\" ispace officials are optimistic about its chances the second time around.",
      "\"We've got experiments that I think are going to help with the establishment of lunar infrastructure that will eventually, hopefully lead to a permanent, significant human presence on the moon,\" said Ron Garan, a former space shuttle astronaut and CEO of ispace USA.",
      "\"We're doing an electrolysis experiment. We're doing a food production experiment. We also have some art installations.\"",
      "A model of a Swedish house will be carried away from the lander on the rover, which will \"set it down on the lunar surface,\" Garan said. \"We're going to photograph it, and it's a really exciting artistic endeavor as well.\"",
      "Garan called the microrover, built by ispace's Luxembourg-based unit and measuring just 10.2 inches tall and 21.6 inches long, \"really critical to the future of our company.\"",
      "\"The data that's going to come off the rover is going to be really valuable to us as we continue to hone our design on the surface mobility aspect of the business,\" he said. \"And so, that's really exciting, too.\"",
      "The Resilience mission is privately funded, without any financing from NASA. The instruments aboard Blue Ghost, in contrast, cost NASA $44 million to develop. The agency agreed to pay Firefly $101 million to carry them to the moon as part of its\u00a0Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's science mission directorate.",
      "\"To date, five vendors have been awarded 11 lunar deliveries under CLPS and are sending more than 50 instruments to various locations on the moon, including the lunar South Pole. Existing CLPS contracts (have) a cumulative maximum contract value of $2.6 billion through 2028. No other nation has done this.\"",
      "The Blue Ghost instruments will collect data on the lunar dust environment, drill into the soil below the lander, monitor background X-ray emissions, test whether Earth-orbiting navigation satellites can be used near the moon and the effectiveness of computer radiation shielding, among other topics of interest.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Fox.",
      "\"The technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost mission will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments and most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Kim said the Blue Ghost mission will span about two months.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump vowed to issue an executive order on Monday to postpone the ban on TikTok from going into effect.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok began restoring service to users in the United States following a temporary and voluntary shutdown that lasted less than a day. The company said Sunday that it was in the process of reinstating access after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to try to pause the ban by executive order on his first day in office.",
      "\"We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,\" TikTok said in a statement. \"It's a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"",
      "STATEMENT FROM TIKTOK:In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170\u2026",
      "TikTok app owner ByteDance voluntarily shut down service in the U.S. just hours before a Sunday deadline, cutting off access to tens of millions of users after the Supreme Court this week\u00a0upheld a law that effectively banned it over concerns about its ties to China.",
      "The law passed by Congress last year gave TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services. TikTok said a sale wasn't possible and challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court on Friday.",
      "Trump on Sunday posted on social media that he would restore TikTok, first writing \"SAVE TIKTOK\" and then vowing to issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law takes effect. Further, he said there would be no liability for companies that helped keep TikTok from going dark before the order went into effect.",
      "\"Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,\" he wrote.\u00a0 \"I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.\u00a0 By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up.\u00a0 Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok.\u00a0 With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.\"",
      "The court's decision said the\u00a0divest-or-ban law\u00a0does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",
      "While the Biden administration said enforcement of the law would be left to the incoming Trump administration, the company itself took itself offline shortly before Sunday's midnight deadline.",
      "Users in the U.S. who opened the app late Saturday night were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",
      "The app was also no longer available in the Apple or Google Play stores. CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment.",
      "Trump's incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that the president-elect had spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping and \"they agreed to work together on this.\"",
      "\"We can have an app that protects Americans,\" Waltz said. \"And I could tell you, I wouldn't want the FBI or the U.S. government monitoring every keystroke or seeing every password, nor would we want the Chinese Communist Party. But we also want an app that 170 million Americans clearly really enjoy and that we were able to get our message out during the Trump campaign in a very powerful way.\"",
      "TikTok had said Friday it would \"be forced to go dark\" beginning Sunday unless the Biden administration assured service providers that the law would not be enforced. The White House called the appeal \"a stunt\" and said the company should bring up its concerns with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.",
      "Internationally on Sunday, the TikTok app remained accessible, and there was no indication for international users that it had gone dark in the U.S. It was still possible to view and interact with American accounts, and there was no obvious official signposting that U.S. users' access had been restricted.",
      "Even if President-elect Trump declines to enforce the ban, the law would still be on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. Trump previously vowed to \"save\" TikTok, and said Saturday that he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law includes a provision that allows for a short-term extension if there is a sale in progress.",
      "During Supreme Court arguments on Jan. 10, Noel Francisco, a lawyer for TikTok, warned that the platform would shut down when the law went into effect, explaining that it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for a divestiture to occur under any timeline because the Chinese government opposes a sale of the algorithm that powers the platform by tailoring video recommendations to each user.",
      "\"As I understand it, we go dark,\" Francisco said.",
      "But even if there is an eventual sale that did not include TikTok's algorithm, it would take \"many years\" for a new team of engineers to rebuild it and it would be a \"fundamentally different platform,\" according to Francisco. He said the company's inability to share any user data with ByteDance under the law would cut off American users from viewing content from other parts of the world and vice versa.",
      "The bipartisan law was tucked into a foreign assistance package that swiftly passed Congress and was signed by President Biden last April. TikTok and ByteDance challenged the law the next month, calling it \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "In a December ruling, a federal appeals court upheld the statute, saying the U.S. government \"acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" The appeals court later denied TikTok's bid to delay the law from taking effect, pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed to take up the case after TikTok requested the justices order a temporary pause. The court issued its opinion a week after hearing arguments and two days before the law took effect.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "The justices cited Congress' finding that companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government under Chinese law.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" the court said.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar noted during arguments that there's \"nothing permanent or irrevocable that happens\" on Sunday. The law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok if there is a sale after the date.",
      "\"Congress expected we might see something like a game of chicken. ByteDance saying, we can't do it, China will never let us do it. But when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider,\" Prelogar said.",
      "In a video statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared confident that the app would have a future under Trump. He thanked the incoming president for his commitment to finding a solution that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. \"for years to come.\"",
      "Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term over national security concerns, said Friday that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok. A Chinese summary of the call did not mention that it was a topic of discussion.",
      "Barring a sale or Congress overturning the law, there's no long-term certainty about TikTok's future in the U.S. If Trump or a future president declines to enforce the law, companies like Apple and Google could still face steep fines in the future.",
      "\"On the 19th, if it doesn't shut down, there is a violation of law, correct?\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Prelogar, who said, \"Yes.\"",
      "\"And whatever the new president does, doesn't change that reality for these companies,\" Sotomayor continued, referring to the penalties facing app stores and web hosting services.",
      "\"That's right,\" Prelogar said, adding that a five-year statute of limitations exists.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 170 million TikTok users in the U.S. were in for a rude awakening late Saturday night when the enormously popular video-sharing app became inaccessible because of a law passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress last year.",
      "TikTok voluntarily shut down service to its users ahead of Sunday's ban. Users in the U.S. who opened the app were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",
      "TikTok was also no longer available in the Apple or Google Play stores. CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment.",
      "Lawmakers and U.S. officials have sounded the alarm for years about the supposed risks that TikTok's ties to China pose to national security, and Congress moved last year to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. The law gave the company a deadline of Jan. 19 \u2014 one day before a new president would take office.",
      "With no sign of a sale in sight, TikTok's last-ditch legal challenge failed on Friday\u00a0when the Supreme Court said the law does not violate the First Amendment.",
      "The Biden White House said it will leave enforcement of the law to the incoming Trump administration, and President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to \"save\" the app. On Saturday, Trump told NBC News he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law allows the president, under some circumstances, to grant a one-time extension of up to 90 days regarding the date when the law goes into effect.",
      "TikTok had hinted it would take itself offline, a move that leaves content creators and users in the lurch as the company seeks a way to get back on firm legal footing.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that the Biden administration had \"failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had earlier Saturday called TikTok's latest statement \"a stunt.\"",
      "\"We have seen the most recent statement from TikTok,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"It is a stunt, and we see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday. We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:09:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say no other app offers the same financial opportunities as TikTok, while creators fear loss of income if it disappears.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

      "The\u00a0Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, that would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok.",
      "The Biden administration and lawmakers\u00a0say TikTok poses a threat\u00a0to U.S. national security, warning that the Chinese government can use the app to collect information and otherwise snoop on American users of the app. For its part, TikTok and some content creators on the platform argued the law violates their First Amendment rights to free speech.",
      "TikTok could evade a ban if ByteDance agreed to sell its American operations to a U.S. entity. Bloomberg reported\u00a0Tuesday that Elon Musk could have interest in such a deal. Still, Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "TikTok has said it could go dark in the U.S. on Jan. 19.\u00a0But it remains unclear if President-elect Donald Trump, who had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law, will intervene and seek a solution once he takes office.",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Cash App-owner Block must offer up to $120 million in refunds to consumers who federal regulators say were exposed to potential fraud.",
    "story": [
      "Block, the parent company of popular online payment service Cash App, has been ordered by a federal agency to pay as much as $175 million because of repeated failures by the financial services provider to protect customers from fraud.",
      "Block has agreed to pay up to $120 million to consumers harmed by fraudulent transactions and unfair business practices detailed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in a consent order filed on Thursday. The company must also pay a fine of $55 million into the CFPB's victims relief fund.",
      "\"Cash App created the conditions for fraud to proliferate on its popular payment platform,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. \"When things went wrong, Cash App flouted its responsibilities and even burdened local banks with problems that the company caused.\"",
      "Block disputes the CFPB's findings.",
      "\"While we strongly disagree with the CFPB's mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what's best for our customers and our business,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The company also said it uses a number of means to support customers and ensure they are protected while using Cash App. Those include providing multiple ways for customers to contact Block, such as a dispute submission tool within Cash App; using AI to spot and stop fraud; and using advanced technology to warn customers about potential scams involving their transactions.",
      "Failure to investigate potential fraud",
      "Peer-to-peer platforms such as Cash App are generally required by law, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions. But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",
      "In one instance cited in the agency's consent order, Cash App instructed a customer who reported an unauthorized debit card to contact the person's bank, shirking its statutory duty to investigate possible incidents of fraud.",
      "\"In numerous instances, respondent failed to conduct investigations promptly or in some cases at all upon Notices of Error from consumers that provided the required information,\" the CFPB said.",
      "When Block did investigate disputes, it \"used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company's favor,\" the consumer agency added.",
      "Unreachable customer service",
      "Block also made it difficult for Cash App clients to obtain helpful customer service, according to the CFPB. For many years, a telephone number listed on the back of the app's Cash Card and in the terms of service connected users to a pre-recorded redirecting them to contact customer support through the app. Those who contacted Cash App customer service through the app, or in some cases by mail, frequently received \"delayed, inadequate, confusing or inaccurate responses,\" the agency said.",
      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",
      "Consumers will not need to take action to obtain a refund, according to the CFPB's latest guidance. The agency said it will enforce the order's requirement to ensure that affected Cash App users receive refunds and other redress.",
      "With more than 56 million accounts, Cash App is one of the largest peer-to-peer payment platforms in the country. The service allows consumers to send and receive electronic money transfers to accept direct deposits and use a prepaid Cash Card to make purchases and ATM withdrawals.",
      "Block made $7.5 billion in gross profit in 2023, roughly $4 billion of which came from Cash App, according to the CFPB.",

    "title": "\"TikTok refugees\" are flocking to RedNote. Could it face the same fate?",
    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 10:10:56 -0500",
    "summary": "With the U.S. ban on TikTok looming, many Americans are opting for another Chinese app known as RedNote. It could be short-lived.",
    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Monday approved a bill known as the Laken Riley Act aimed at expanding the federal government's mandate to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally, as congressional Republicans look to deliver for President Trump as he enters office.",
      "In a 64 to 35 vote, the Senate approved the legislation, with 12 Democrats joining all voting Republicans in favor.  The measure marks the first policy legislation of the new Congress, which the House approved earlier this month before the Senate amended it.",
      "The House will need to approve the Senate's changes before it can head to the president's desk.",
      "The Laken Riley Act, named after a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year, would expand mandatory detention to include noncitizens convicted of or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting, as well as those who admit to committing those crimes. The legislation would also empower state attorneys general who claim their states or residents have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the federal government.",
      "Sen. Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican who sponsored the bill in the Senate, called the legislation a \"targeted, common sense, life-saving bill\" ahead of the vote Monday, urging her colleagues to support the measure.",
      "\"Today we return to common sense, we return to practicality,\" Britt said on the Senate floor. \"If you come here illegally and you commit a crime, you should not be free to roam the streets of this nation. Our children deserve better.\"",
      "Though dozens of Senate Democrats had supported opening debate on the measure earlier this month, many did so while pushing for amendments to the legislation. The Senate approved two Republican-backed amendments, which expanded the legislation's scope to include the assault of a law enforcement officer and crimes that result in the death \"or serious bodily injury of another person\" as grounds for mandatory detention. But a Democratic-led amendment to cut the provision that empowers state attorneys general fell short. In the final procedural hurdle last week, 10 Democrats voted with Republicans.",
      "Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, argued Monday that the bill is not targeted enough, pointing to the conditions for detaining immigrants who are accused of committing a \"very broad set of crimes\" without considering \"how young they are or, more important, whether they're a threat to our communities.\"",
      "The legislation has also sparked questions over whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement could fully enforce this new mandate without more funding, since the agency is currently using roughly 39,000 of 41,000 detention beds funded by Congress. The Department of Homeland Security is mandated under current law to detain noncitizens convicted of certain crimes, including \"aggravated felonies,\" or serious offenses like murder and sexual assault.",
      "Last year, the House also passed the measure, but it stalled in the then-Democratic controlled Senate. But Democrats appeared more willing to engage on the measure after the election. Voters cited immigration as a key issue and delivered Republican victories up and down the ballot. Earlier this month, 48 House Democrats also joined Republicans to approve the measure, up from the 37 who did so last year.",
      "As Republicans made immigration a key platform during the 2024 election and touted plans to address border security with a new GOP trifecta, Democrats have repeatedly cited the breakdown of a bipartisan border deal last year, which came at the urging of Mr. Trump.",

    "summary": "Donald and Melania Trump launched new cryptocurrencies over the weekend. Some experts are advising investors to be cautious.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, got a head start on those plans by debuting new his-and-her meme coins \u2014 \u00a0the $Trump and $Melania coins \u2014 over the weekend. As of Monday afternoon, the day of Mr. Trump's inauguration, the two digital currencies were worth a combined $9.5 billion.",
      "Meme coins, which have no economic or transactional value, are cryptocurrencies linked to internet trends, such as Dogecoin, which was inspired by the image of a shiba inu dog. Dogecoin became a favored cryptocurrency of billionaire Elon Musk, who even named his federal cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, after it.",
      "Mr. Trump announced his cryptocurrency on Friday night, writing on social media that the coin celebrates \"everything we stand for: WINNING!\" The meme coin is being marketed with a picture of Trump holding a fist up superimposed over the words \"FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT,\" a reference to Trump's response to an assassination attempt at a political rally in July.",
      "On Sunday, Melania Trump announced her own meme coin with a black-and-white photo of the First Lady smiling and with her hands clasped in front of her face, as if in thanks.",
      "The new meme coins are a way for Mr. Trump to leverage his online popularity, drawing his supporters to the project, noted Joe McCann, CEO of digital assets investment firm Asymmetric. The products, like Mr. Trump's social media company, tend to attract individual investors, rather than large U.S. institutional firms, who buy shares as a way to show support for the president.",
      "\"Meme coins largely represent communities on the internet represented by a financial asset \u2014 they're the tokenization of internet culture,\" McCann told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Donald Trump is arguably the most popular person on the internet, so by launching a meme coin, members of his community can further gain proximity to him.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to monetize his name with numerous commercial ventures, ranging from a licensing deal for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, that earned him $7.2 million, to a\u00a0$59.99 Bible\u00a0that earned him $300,000 in royalties. He's also recently rolled out Trump-branded sneakers, a \"Fight, Fight, Fight\"-branded perfume and watches.",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump coins.",
      "How much are the Donald and Melania Trump meme coins worth?",
      "As of Monday afternoon, the Trump meme coin had a market cap of $8.3 billion, while Melania Trump's cryptocurrency was valued at $1.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Mr. Trump's meme coin soared after it debuted, hitting a peak of almost $75 each. But the price has shed about 45% of its value since then, settling at about $40 per coin on Monday afternoon. Still, that represents a surge of more than 400% from its initial price, CoinMarketCap data shows.",
      "Melania Trump's meme coin has had a slightly rockier debut, sinking more than 20% to about $5.40 per coin on Monday.",
      "Are $Trump and $Melania real investments?",
      "The Trump meme coin website says the president's cryptocurrency is meant as an expression of support \u2014 not an investment opportunity.",
      "The Melania site describes the meme coins as \"digital collectibles,\" adding that they \"are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract or security of any type.\"",
      "Investors typically scrutinize balance sheets and income statements when deciding where to allocate their funds, while currency traders will examine economic factors like trade flow and GDP growth when placing their investments. But relying on these traditional measures don't work with meme coins because they aren't tied to an underlying asset or economy, experts note.",
      "\"Attempting to use traditional financial models to value a meme coin will fail miserably,\" McCann noted. \"Business schools don't teach students how to measure culture, virality or communities.\"",
      "Are meme coins risky?",
      "Meme coins are a highly volatile corner of the crypto sector that often start as a joke and have no intrinsic value, although they can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Because of those dynamics, their prices are prone sudden and extreme swings.",
      "\"Meme coins are some of the most volatile assets on earth and should be treated with caution and care,\" McCann said.",
      "The site selling the $Trump coin warned buyers that its price \"may be extremely volatile and you may experience substantial losses in connection with a sale or other disposition of Trump Memes.\"",
      "Meme coins gained popularity in 2021 and 2022, but some inexperienced investors were unprepared for digital currencies' extreme volatility, noted Nigel Green, CEO of wealth management firm deVere Group, in an email. As a result, he's advising investors to be cautious before putting their money into the Trump meme coins.",
      "How can you buy the Trump and Melania meme coins?",
      "The meme coins are available to buy on an app called Moonshot, which allows people to buy meme coins with Apple Pay, credit or debit card, cryptocurrency, or payment apps like PayPal and Venmo.",
      "The Trump meme coin website notes that all transactions \"ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. We shall have no responsibility or liability for any Trump Memes that are lost, misplaced or inaccessible.\"",
      "What is the cryptocurrency industry's view?",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin's release, saying it reflects the president's support for an industry that felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. Mr. Trump has promised to usher in crypto-friendly regulations and picked crypto backers for key government positions.",
      "For instance, Mr. Trump has nominated cryptocurrency supporter Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, reinforcing optimism that the new president will deregulate the sector.",
      "Other cryptocurrencies are gaining in value on anticipation that the second Trump administration will benefit the sector. Bitcoin, for instance, soared more than 50% since the November election, surging to a record peak of $109,241 ahead of Mr. Trump's inauguration ceremony.",

      "The shakeup has affected at least 20 State Department officials, including career diplomats and political appointees serving in leadership roles, who received notification as early as Friday, sources familiar with the personnel changes told CBS News. All of the department's under secretaries and assistant secretaries \u2014 including those leading regional bureaus that coordinate how U.S. foreign relations is conducted in six world regions\u00a0\u2014 have been instructed to step aside, the sources confirmed.",
      "The State Department has not commented.",
      "While it is normal for a new administration to choose its own political appointees for various senior roles within the State Department, the extent and speed at which the current leadership has been terminated \u2014 including career officials \u2014 is shocking, the source said.",
      "Experienced career diplomats have typically remained in senior roles while the new administration's picks for political appointees await Senate confirmation. A whole swath of leadership must now be replaced by foreign and civil service diplomats who don't necessarily have as much senior management experience, the source added.",
      "Among those who were told to step down in advance of Mr. Trump's inauguration include career diplomat John Bass, who has served as the No. 3 official under Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the roles of acting under secretary for political affairs and under secretary for management, and assistant secretary for energy resources Geoff Pyatt, CBS has learned.",
      "In his farewell remarks to the staff crowded in the mezzanine of the State Department on Friday, Blinken said there is \"No finer foreign service officer in this generation than John Bass.\"",
      "The Foreign Service Institute, which oversees the development of foreign service careers, fielded a large volume of calls Friday as it tried to figure out where to reassign individuals affected by the orders, the source said. There is usually a period of a few months during which they may be reassigned to new roles.",
      "There is a feeling of overall confidence among the rank and file about Sen. Marco Rubio, who is expected to be confirmed as secretary of state, sources told CBS News. He has long served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has substantial familiarity with foreign policy and national security. But the speed and large scale of the leadership shakeup, along with Mr. Trump's consistent criticism of the so-called \"deep state,\" have left some staff in the department concerned about who is being brought in to oversee the State Department, and how long Rubio himself may be able to stay in the top job, said one source familiar with the reaction inside the department.",
      "Mr. Trump and Rubio are aligned on many foreign policy areas, including a need to be far tougher on China and Iran, on upholding the recent ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, and the need for a political settlement between Russia and Ukraine to end the war.",
      "The Trump White House announced Monday\u00a0that career ambassador Lisa Kenna will temporarily serve as acting secretary of state until Rubio is confirmed.",
      "Reuters first reported the beginning of the shakeup last week, when three senior career diplomats overseeing the department's workforce and internal coordination were told to step aside.",
      "Editor's note: Bridget Brink, who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, was not among those told to resign immediately. An earlier version of this article said that she was."

    "story": [
      "A sweeping federal cost-cutting effort led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is facing multiple lawsuits, with the litigation coinciding with President Trump's January\u00a0inauguration.",
      "One suit, filed Monday by a public interest law firm called National Security Counselors, claims DOGE is operating as a federal advisory committee. That puts the initiative in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA, which regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, according to the group.",
      "FACA requires these groups to be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee,\" the lawsuit states. The lawsuit was filed shortly after noon Eastern time in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, National Security Counselors told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The law requires that advisory committees are \"objective and accessible to the public,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. General Services Administration.",
      "A coalition representing veterans, public health professionals, teachers and other groups also filed a suit Monday against DOGE, citing FACA and asking a court to block DOGE's activities until it complies with law.",
      "\"The question every American should be asking is 'What are they hiding?'\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organization representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \"DOGE must not be allowed to operate in the shadows without the transparency, oversight, and opportunity for public participation required of any federal department by the law.\"",
      "Neither the Trump campaign nor Elon Musk immediately responded to a request for comment. Ramaswamy is expected to step away from DOGE as he embarks on a campaign for Ohio governor later this month.",
      "DOGE breaking the law?",
      "DOGE, which isn't an official government agency, was tasked by Trump to produce recommendations on trimming federal outlays, with billionaires Musk and Ramaswamy saying they aimed to cut about $500 billion in annual expenditures. The lawsuit claims that DOGE so far appears to have largely appointed three types of people to work on its efforts: tech industry executives, people affiliated with the Trump campaign and his prior administration as well as associates of Musk or Ramaswamy's.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that, as a result, DOGE is in violation of FACA because \"not a single member of DOGE is a federal employee or represents the perspective of federal employees, despite the evidence that DOGE intends to provide recommendations regarding federal employment practices and ways to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\"",
      "It also claims that DOGE is violating the law's mandate that advisory committee meetings must be open to the public, noting that Musk and Ramaswamy have held private meetings with various elected officials, as well as with tech executives.",
      "\"Nobody disputes that there is a huge amount of wasteful spending in the federal government,\" Kel McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our only concern is that DOGE, as it is currently constituted, lacks the expertise to understand how its recommendations will backfire if it pushes federal workers out without understanding why they are there in the first place.",
      "He added, \"Government work is not corporate work, and any recommendations made without that perspective are doomed to fail.\"",
      "The lawsuit's plaintiffs include two men who sent in applications to be hired by DOGE. One, Jerald Lentini, is an attorney for National Security Counselors, while the second, Joshua Erlich, is an attorney who frequently represents federal employees and could represent their viewpoints, the lawsuit notes. Neither has heard back from DOGE about their applications.",

I've already talked to him about it.\"",

      "In the 30-minute speech in the Capitol Rotunda, he promised a \"tide of change\" and salvation from what he said was the \"decline\" brought on by the policies of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",
      "To that end, he's expected to sign about 200 executive orders, actions and proclamations following his address.",
      "\"The golden age of America begins right now,\" Mr. Trump said. \"From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.\"",
      "Here is the full transcript of Mr. Trump's second inaugural address, provided by the Associated Press.",
      "The full text of Trump's inauguration speech",
      "Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the United States Supreme Court, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris and my fellow citizens:",
      "The golden age of America begins right now. From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation. And we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer.",
      "During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first. Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end. And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud and prosperous and free.",
      "America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before. I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.",
      "But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing and the United States of America. As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, the radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens. While the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair, we now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad.",
      "It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world. We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders, or more importantly, its own people.",
      "Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina, who've been treated so badly. And other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago. Or more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They're raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home any longer. That's interesting.",
      "But we can't let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That's going to change. We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today and will change very quickly.",
      "Our recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom. From this moment on, America's decline is over.",
      "Our liberties and our nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied and we will immediately restore the integrity, competency and loyalty of America's government. Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed to take my life. Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then, and believe even more so now, that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again.",
      "That is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. For American citizens, Jan. 20, 2025, is Liberation Day.",
      "It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country. As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society. Young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban and rural. And, very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states and the popular vote. We won by millions of people.",
      "To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.",
      "Today is Martin Luther King Day and his honor \u2014 this will be a great honor \u2014 but in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true.",
      "National unity is now returning to America and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country. We will not forget our Constitution. And we will not forget our God.",
      "Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense. First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted. And we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. Under the orders I sign today we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.",
      "As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions. And that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices. And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.",
      "America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have: the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth. And we are going to use it. We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again. And it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.",
      "With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. In other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice. We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the auto workers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote.",
      "I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources.",
      "The American Dream will soon be back and thriving like never before. To restore confidence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand new Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America. Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents. Something I know something about. We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the Constitution and the rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.",
      "This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. This week I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from the military for objecting to the Covid vaccine mandate with full back pay. And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It's going to end immediately. Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission\u2014defeating America's enemies. Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.",
      "We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end. And, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into. My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be. A peacemaker and a unifier. I'm pleased to say that, as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.",
      "America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world. A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. And we will restore the name of the great President William McKinley to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.",
      "He was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States \u2014 the United States, I mean, think of this, spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made. And Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.",
      "Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor and the vitality of history's greatest civilization. So as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy and disease free. The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons. And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.",
      "And it's the lifeblood of a great nation. And, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other. There's no nation like our nation. Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls. Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close. Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted millions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.",
      "Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best. From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steel workers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride. Together they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.",
      "After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore an American promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love. And we love it so much. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child to dreams for their future: I am with you, I will fight for you and I will win for you. And we're going to win like never before.",
      "In recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again. Greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other. Full of compassion, courage and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.",
      "America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith and goodwill. We will be prosperous. We will be proud. We will be strong and we will win like never before. We will not be conquered. We will not be intimidated. We will not be broken. And we will not fail.",
      "From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign and independent nation. We will stand bravely. We will live proudly. We will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way. Because we are Americans. The future is ours. And our golden age has just begun.",

      "Trump rails against U.S. \"decline\"",
      "The president quickly pivoted in his speech to lament the state of the nation under his predecessor's policies. Mr. Trump condemned the U.S. education and health systems, saying, \"My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the American people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed that the government cannot provide basic services, as demonstrated by the devastation in western North Carolina as a result of Hurricane Helene in late September. The president also turned to a familiar topic, the southern border.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is planning to invoke muscular presidential powers to begin a sweeping crackdown on immigration following his inauguration on Monday, tasking the military with border enforcement, designating cartels and gangs as terrorist groups, shutting down asylum and refugee admissions and attempting to terminate birthright citizenship.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to issue around 10 executive actions on his first day in office to start reshaping federal immigration and border policy, many of which are expected to face significant legal challenges, incoming administration officials said on a call with reporters on Monday morning.",
      "\"As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is what I'm going to do,\" Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address.",
      "Here are the executive actions Mr. Trump is planning to take on immigration and border policy:",
      "A national emergency to increase military presence at the border",
      "Mr. Trump is planning to declare a national emergency at the southern border, the officials said. He will order the Department of Defense to more heavily involve the vast resources and manpower of the U.S. military at the border, tasking officials to deploy additional troops there.",
      "For over the past decades, the U.S. military has had a presence along the U.S.-Mexico border, mostly to provide operational assistance to Customs and Border Protection.",
      "An \"end\" to asylum, and restarting border wall construction and \"Remain in Mexico\"",
      "Mr. Trump is instructing officials to restart construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, relaunching a massive, multi-billion-dollar government project that had been halted by President Biden. During the Trump administration, about 450 miles of barriers were built along the southwest border.",
      "Federal agencies will be ordered to begin the process of reinstating the so-called \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which requires migrants to wait for their asylum hearings on the Mexican side of the border. President Biden's administration suspended that policy soon after taking office, though it was forced to revive it briefly due to a court order. Reviving the program would require the consent of the Mexican government, which has not yet publicly agreed to it.",
      "Mr. Trump is also set to cite his presidential powers to \"end\" asylum by proclamation, allowing for fast-track deportations at the U.S.-Mexico border, officials said.",
      "Existing rules issued by the Biden administration in June already disqualify most migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally from asylum. That policy, alongside Mexico's efforts to slow U.S.-bound migration, has been credited for the current four-year-low in illegal border crossings.",
      "Labeling gangs, cartels as terrorist groups",
      "Mr. Trump is designating cartels and international gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, seeking to penalize the groups that largely control the illicit movement of migrants and drugs across the U.S. southern border. The gangs include the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and MS-13, which originated in U.S. cities before spreading to Central America.",
      "The incoming administration plans to invoke the Alien and Sedition Act of 1798 to seek the removal of Tren de Aragua gang members, officials said, arguing they are an \"armed force of the Venezuelan government\" conducting a \"predatory incursion and invasion\" into the U.S.",
      "An attempt to end birthright citizenship",
      "Mr. Trump is planning to attempt to deny birthright citizenship to the children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, according to the incoming officials. The U.S. government has long interpreted the U.S. Constitution to mean that those born on American soil are citizens at birth, regardless of their parents' immigration status.",
      "The 14th Amendment to the Constitution says: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "A pause in refugee admissions",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to suspend refugee admissions into the U.S. for at least 4 months.",
      "The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program allows certain refugees fleeing persecution and war to come to the U.S. legally after rounds of interviews, security vetting and medical screenings. The Biden administration had rebuilt refugee admissions after they fell to a record low at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to travel limits and drastic Trump-era cuts to the program.",
      "Shutting down Biden administration immigration programs",
      "Mr. Trump is planning to issue an order rescinding Biden administration programs. Although they were not described in the call, they likely include a phone app that allows asylum-seekers in Mexico to request entry into the U.S. and an initiative that allowed migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to fly to the U.S. if they had American sponsors. Both policies were designed to curb illegal immigration by offering would-be migrant legal alternatives to crossing the southern border illegally.",
      "The U.S. government estimates that around 270,000 migrants are currently in Mexico, trying to get an appointment to enter the U.S. through the app, known as CBP One, according to CBS News reporting. The incoming Trump administration swiftly shut down the app once Mr. Trump was sworn in, with a message on its website saying \"existing appointments have been cancelled.\"",
      "Other actions",
      "Officials said Mr. Trump will direct the attorney general to seek the death penalty for unauthorized immigrants who murder law enforcement officers or commit \"capital\" crimes.",
      "Mr. Trump is also assigning agencies to issue suggestions for further restrictions on immigration from countries of \"particular concern.\"",

    "story": [
      "With just moments left before he leaves office, President Joe Biden commuted the life sentence of indigenous activist Leonard Peltier, who was convicted in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents.",
      "Peltier was denied parole as recently as July and wasn't eligible for parole again until 2026. He was serving life in prison for the deaths of the agents during a standoff on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. He will transition to home confinement, Biden said in a statement.",
      "\"President Biden took an enormous step toward healing and reconciliation with the Native American people in this country,\" Peltier's former attorney Kevin Sharp said in a statement Monday. \"It took nearly 50 years to acknowledge the injustice of Leonard Peltier's conviction and continued incarceration, but with the president's act of mercy Leonard can finally return to his reservation and live out his remaining days.\"",
      "Sharp, a former chief judge of the federal U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, represented Peltier for five years and filed petitions for clemency, which does not change Peltier's conviction, on his behalf in 2019 and 2021.",
      "The fight for Peltier's freedom is entangled with the Indigenous rights movements. Nearly half a century later, his name remains a rallying cry.",
      "An enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa in North Dakota, Peltier was active in the American Indian Movement, which began in the 1960s as a local organization in Minneapolis that grappled with issues of police brutality and discrimination against Native Americans. It quickly became a national force.",
      "The movement grabbed headlines in 1973 when it took over the village of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge reservation, leading to a 71-day standoff with federal agents. Tensions between the movement and the government remained high for years.",
      "On June 26, 1975, agents came to Pine Ridge to serve arrest warrants amid battles over Native treaty rights and self-determination.",
      "After being injured in a shootout, agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were shot in the head at close range, FBI has said. Also killed in the shootout was American Indian Movement member Joseph Stuntz.",
      "Two other movement members, Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted of killing Coler and Williams.",
      "After fleeing to Canada and being extradited to the United States, Peltier was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced in 1977 to life in prison, despite defense claims that evidence against him had been falsified.",
      "The FBI, which has long opposed Peltier's release, released a letter Monday that then-Director Christoper Wray wrote to Biden earlier this month opposing a pardon or commutation for Peltier.",
      "\"Even though courts have repeatedly examined and exposed Peltier's claims as baseless, his sympathizers continue to wrongly promote him as a standard-bearer for legitimate grievances about the United States government's historical mistreatment of Native Americans,\" Wray said in the letter. \"But the facts cannot \u2014 and must not \u2014 be ignored. Peltier is a ruthless murderer who has shown a complete lack of remorse for his many crimes.\"",

      "Trump, who will be inaugurated on Monday at noon EST, wants to increase domestic oil and gas production in order to bring down prices for U.S. consumers, the official said.

      "Trump, who has long opposed clean energy and EV subsidies, has said the U.S. needs to increase traditional oil and gas production in order to reduce energy prices for Americans, a theme he reiterated in his inauguration speech on Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Cecile Richards, a feminist activist and former president of Planned Parenthood, died Monday after battling cancer, her family said. Richards was 67.",
      "\"This morning our beloved Cecile passed away at home, surrounded by her family and her ever-loyal dog, Ollie. Our hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives,\" read a statement attributed to Richards' husband, Kirk Adams, and their three children, which CBS News obtained. \"We are grateful to the doctors and health care workers who provided her excellent care and the friends, family, and well-wishers who have been by her side during this challenging time.\"",
      "The family asked those looking to honor Richards' life and legacy to recall a sentiment that they said she repeated often over the last year. \"It's not hard to imagine future generations one day asking: 'When there was so much at stake for our country, what did you do?' The only acceptable answer is: 'Everything we could,'\" the statement quoted her as saying.",
      "A longstanding champion of women's rights, Texas-born Richards will be remembered as one of the United States' most prominent advocates for abortion access in recent decades, who steered Planned Parenthood from 2006 to 2018. She repeatedly defended the organization and its mission against mounting attacks from political opponents, including President-elect Donald Trump, whose pledge to overturn the landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade was central to his first presidential campaign.",
      "Richards was diagnosed in 2023 with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. She initially shared the news in an interview with The Cut, published last January.",
      "\"The last six months have been wild \u2014 but thanks to incredible health care providers and the support of family and friends, I'm doing really well,\" Richards wrote in a social media post at the time. \"I've felt lucky all my life, and I feel lucky now: to be here, doing this work, alongside all of you.\"",
      "After stepping down as president of Planned Parenthood, Richards went on to found a new political action group, called Supermajority, alongside Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza and National Domestic Workers Alliance director Ai-jen Poo. The group focuses on encouraging women to become politically active, with the aim of empowering them as a voting bloc.",
      "Alexis McGill Johnson, Planned Parenthood's current president and CEO, called Richards \"an indomitable force\" and praised her for lifting the organization \"to new heights\" during her tenure in another statement Monday.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to lose a giant in the fight for reproductive freedom. As we continue to navigate uncharted territory, we will be able to meet the challenges we face in large part because of the movement Cecile built over decades,\" Johnson said. \"I know, without a doubt, that Cecile would tell us the best way to honor her memory is to suit up \u2014 preferably in pink \u2014 link arms, and fight like hell for Planned Parenthood patients across the country.\"",
      "Richards' work earned her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November, adding to the accolades she received throughout her career. TIME magazine named her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012.",
      "President Biden said in a statement that he and first lady Jill Biden were \"deeply saddened\" by Richards' death, and described her as \"a leader of utmost character\" who followed in the footsteps of her mother, former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, also a political activist.",
      "\"Cecile fearlessly led us forward to be the America we say we are,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"Carrying her mom's torch for justice, she championed some of our Nation's most important civil rights causes. She fought for the dignity of workers, defended and advanced women's reproductive rights and equality, and mobilized our fellow Americans to exercise their power to vote. She was a leader of utmost character and I know that her legacy will continue to inspire generations to come.\"",

    "summary": "Many experts say luck does play a part \u2014 but they also say there are many ways that homes can be made less vulnerable to fire.",
    "story": [
      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles next to those left standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world.",
      "For many homeowners, like Enrique Balcazar, the sometimes scattershot nature of the carnage can seem like random chance. Balcazar, a real estate agent, posted video that showed little more than chimneys remaining of most homes on his block after fire leapt through his Altadena neighborhood. Balcazar stood on his neighbor's destroyed classic Mustang to douse his smoldering roof, but his home was otherwise fine.",
      "\"It's an older house and it still has the old wood sidings,\" Balcazar said. \"To me there's nothing explainable in logical or scientific reason of why my house would not have burned.\"",
      "Many experts say luck does play a part. After all, wind can shift 180 degrees in a split second, pushing fire away from your house and towards a neighbor's. But they also say there are many ways that homes can be made less vulnerable to fire.",
      "\"Because there are, say, 50 ways a fire can burn your house,\" said Greg Faulkner of Faulkner Architects in California, who has focused on less combustible home exteriors for more than a decade. \"If you eliminate half of those, or three-quarters of them, that's not luck, that's increasing your odds.\"",
      "People in fire country generally know that trees, landscaping and wood fences near homes can be a fire risk. Architects and contractors are going beyond that, using newer materials and techniques in roofing, walls and windows to keep buildings standing. The measures do add cost to the homes - around 3% to 6%, Faulkner said, or as much as 10% for the most robust protection.",
      "Many of these experts no longer use wood siding. Where it is used, or still allowed, it needs to have a fire-resistant barrier underneath, often made of gypsum, the same material used to make drywall. That way if the wood catches fire, it takes longer for the heat to reach inside the home",
      "But even with that, you're still putting a combustible material on the building, said Richard Schuh, with Nielsen : Schuh Architects. \"So that would be something we would avoid. Use of fire-resistant materials is critical.\"",
      "Stucco, a cement material, is a common exterior for Southern California houses and it's fire-resistant. Reviewing AP photographs showing buildings still standing, Arnold Tarling, who has four decades experience in fire protection and building inspection in Britain, said houses with stucco walls appeared to survive the Los Angeles fires better. Yet if more of them had had a layer of gypsum beneath the stucco, it would have given more protection from the heat, he said.",
      "Windows are a huge factor in whether a home burns down, because so much heat is transmitted through them. Double-pane windows significantly slow heat coming from the burning building next door.",
      "\"The outside layer protects the inside layer until it fails,\" said Schuh. Codes in many places require one of the two panes to be tempered, which is much more resistant to heat than conventional glass, he said.",
      "Tarling noted one intact Malibu beachfront home, surrounded by gutted buildings. He speculated that the fact that no windows faced a neighbor helped protect it because radiated heat couldn't penetrate as easily.",
      "In his buildings, Faulkner builds in fire shutters that can slide closed and cover the windows.",
      "Then there's the roof - a convenient landing pad for fire embers.",
      "Simpler roof lines can allow red-hot embers to slide off. Spanish Mission, for example, is an iconic Los Angeles style - part of what says \"Hollywood\" in movies about the city, for example, as well as a reminder of its Mexican and Spanish history. That style doesn't always have simple roof lines - the knee walls that are common on Mission-style roofs create corners.",
      "\"The embers could, just like snow, gather in that corner,\" Faulkner said.",
      "Many roofs in the U.S. are covered in asphalt. Areas that are designated as wildfire-prone in California \u2013 an ever-growing area \u2013 are required to use roofing that delays the transfer of heat to the inside of the building, called one-hour or Class A.",
      "Still, asphalt is a petroleum product. Some building professionals prefer metal, which doesn't burn. Metal has its own downside, though: It conducts heat. Putting a layer of gypsum under a metal roof is becoming a common practice in some areas.",
      "\"Like a blow torch\"",
      "Maybe as important as which material is used on a roof is whether the roof offers fire a way to get in. Here, as in so many tradeoffs, one effort to do good conflicts with another: Contractors have been more careful over the years to make sure moisture doesn't build up in attics by making sure air circulates, using those vents that are visible on many roofs or under eaves.",
      "But in a powerful fire, Schuh says, \"if you're on the side where the wind is putting pressure against the house, it's also blowing the flames into the house like a blow torch,\" and fire gets in through the vents.",
      "On the other side of the house, it can create a vacuum, several experts said, sucking fire in.",
      "But you can't easily just eliminate roof ventilation because it will cause moisture problems, said Cesar Martin Gomez, an architect at the University of Navarra, Spain, who's worked for 25 years in building services.",
      "Faulkner said in some buildings he's eliminating the need for ventilation in the roof structure by sealing the spaces. Schuh is using a cover on roof vents that can actually respond to fire with a mesh that closes.",
      "Martin Gomez noted that in some parts of Australia, new homes are required to have water tanks. \"If each home has the ability to protect itself, fire won't be able to spread as much,\" he said.",
      "And some homes in the U.S. are now built with sprinkler systems for the outside of the house, not just the inside. It sprays water with a soapy solution to make it flow over the surface of the building, Schuh said.",
      "\"You're adding one more layer of protection to your building, and that's more of a priority now than ever because your insurance company may or not be around for you,\" he said.",
      "About 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in an email last week to CBS MoneyWatch. An\u00a0analysis\u00a0of insurance data by CBS News San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods.",

      "French customs officials said Monday that a record 31,000 tons of illegally imported honey touted as an all-natural sexual enhancement \u2014 but often tainted with erectile dysfunction drugs \u2014 were seized in the country last year.",
      "The packets of honey and gels, sold as \"shots\" or \"sticks\" with names like Black Horse or Bio Max, are often sold surreptitiously in clubs and other nightlife spots.",
      "Use of the \"aphrodisiac honey\" has increased in recent years, with officials warning of potentially serious health risks from ingredients not listed on the labels.",
      "\"Since the quantity of adulteration is unknown, and the doses consumed are not recommended or quantified, the consumer takes significant risks by consuming this type of adulterated honey,\" France's customs office said in a statement.",
      "They often contain chemical products like sildenafil or tadalafil, the main substances in the erectile dysfunction drugs Viagra and Cialis, which in France are only available on prescription.",
      "Already in 2021, health authorities had warned of several cases where the honey had caused convulsions, cerebral oedemas or acute kidney injuries.",
      "France's customs office said it had seized 31,000 tons, mainly coming from countries including Malaysia, Turkey, Tunisia and Thailand.",
      "\"They arrive by sea, in containers in large quantities, or by express freight, in smaller volumes, following purchases on the Internet,\" the office said.",
      "The biggest find was made in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille in November \u2014 13 tons worth in around 860,000 sticks in a shipment from Malaysia.",
      "Last June, officials said customs officers from Lyon and Clermont-Ferrand seized nearly 25,000 doses of the honey in a storage box.",

    "summary": "A British teen has pleaded guilty to murder over an allegedly \"meticulously planned\" stabbing rampage at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class for kids.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A British teen pleaded guilty Monday to murdering three girls and attempting to kill 10 other people in what a prosecutor said was a \"meticulously planned\" stabbing rampage at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England last summer. Axel Rudakubana, 18, entered the surprise plea as jury selection had been expected to begin at the start of his trial in Liverpool Crown Court.",
      "The July 29 stabbings sent shock waves across the U.K. and led to a week of widespread rioting across parts of England and Northern Ireland after the suspect was falsely identified as an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in Britain by boat. He was actually born in Wales.",
      "The rampage occurred on the first day of summer vacation when the little girls at the Hart Space, a facility hidden behind a row of houses, were in a class to learn yoga and dance to the songs of Taylor Swift. What was supposed to be a day of joy turned to terror and heartbreak when Rudakubana, armed with a knife, intruded and began stabbing the girls and their teacher in the seaside town of Southport in northwest England.",
      "\"This was an unspeakable attack \u2014 one which left an enduring mark on our community and the nation for its savagery and senselessness,\" Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Ursula Doyle said. \"A day which should have been one of carefree innocence; of children enjoying a dance workshop and making friendship bracelets, became a scene of the darkest horror as Axel Rudakubana carried out his meticulously planned rampage.\"",
      "Prosecutors haven't said what they believe led Rudakubana \u2014 who was days shy of his 18th birthday \u2014 to commit the atrocities but Doyle said it was clear he had a \"a sickening and sustained interest in death and violence.\"",
      "Rudakubana had consistently refused to speak in court and did so once again when asked to identify himself at the start of the proceedings. But he broke his silence when he was read the 16-count indictment and asked to enter a plea, replying \"guilty\" to each charge.",
      "He pleaded guilty to three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and additional charges related to possessing the poison ricin and for having an al-Qaeda manual.",
      "Rudakubana faces life imprisonment when sentenced Thursday, Justice Julian Goose said.",
      "Defense lawyer Stanley Reiz said he would present information to the judge about Rudakubana's mental health that may be relevant to his sentence.",
      "The surviving victims and family members of those killed were absent in court because they had expected to arrive Tuesday for opening statements.",
      "Goose asked the prosecutor to apologize on his behalf that they were not present to hear Rudakubana plead guilty.",
      "He pleaded guilty to murdering Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6.",
      "Eight other girls, ranging in age from 7 to 13, were wounded, along with instructor Leanne Lucas and Jonathan Hayes, who worked in a business next door and intervened. Fifteen other girls, as young as 5, were at the class but uninjured. Under a court order, none of the surviving girls can be named.",
      "King Charles III and Taylor Swift met separately with some of the victims' families after the attack.",
      "Police said the stabbings weren't classified as acts of terrorism because the motive wasn't known.",
      "Several months after his arrest at the scene of the crime, Rudakubana was charged with additional counts for production of a biological toxin, ricin and possession of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing to commit an act of terrorism for having the manual in a document on his computer.",
      "Police said they found the evidence during a search of his family's home in a neighboring village.",
      "The day after the killings \u2014 and shortly after a peaceful vigil for the victims \u2014 a violent group attacked a mosque near the crime scene and pelted police officers with bricks and bottles and set fire to police vehicles.",
      "Rioting then spread to dozens of other towns over the next week when groups made up mostly of men mobilized by far-right activists on social media clashed with police during violent protests and attacked hotels housing migrants.",
      "More than 1,200 people were arrested for the disorder and hundreds have been jailed for up to nine years in prison.",

    "summary": "On the first full day of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, 3 Israeli hostages and 90 Palestinian prisoners are back with their loved ones.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time in 471 days, Palestinian medics in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip didn't report a single death from Israeli military action on Monday, as a tense ceasefire between Hamas and Israel settled into place. CBS News teams in Israel, Gaza and in the occupied West Bank saw more joy \u2014 or at least relief \u2014 than had been painted on the faces of residents for 15 months.",
      "The ceasefire came into effect Sunday after an initial three-hour delay, during which almost 20 more Palestinians were killed, according to medics in the decimated Palestinian territory.",
      "Under the terms of the deal, which the U.S. helped broker along with Qatar and Egypt, three Israeli hostages were released by Hamas on Sunday after the fighting stopped. Just after midnight local time, 90 Palestinian prisoners were freed from an Israeli prison in the occupied West Bank.",
      "After more than a year of devastating war sparked by Hamas' brutal Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack, which saw militants kill some 1,200 people and kidnap 251 others, the people of Gaza heard the sound of children playing Monday instead of the thunder of fighter jets and airstrikes, observed Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations' agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, in a statement posted on social media.",
      "\"Our teams reported a good first day of the ceasefire,\" he said, adding that aid and some commercial supplies had started flowing smoothly into Gaza on Sunday. Along with the reciprocal release of hostages and prisoners, that is the other major component of the ceasefire deal. At least 600 aid trucks per day are supposed to enter Gaza, carrying everything from desperately needed food and medicine to fuel for generators.",
      "\"The ceasefire must continue to hold and all elements of the agreement must be implemented,\" said Lazzarini. \"It is a step in the right direction towards long-lasting peace and stability for all.\"",
      "Palestinians eager to return to obliterated homes in Gaza",
      "Reconstructing Gaza will be an incredibly long and costly process, and it is only provisioned to begin in earnest during the third and final phase of the three-phase ceasefire agreement, which, assuming the deal remains in-tact, could be several months away. Still, the Hamas-run Gaza City Municipality said in a statement Monday that it started to at least clear the main roads, which had been closed during the war.",
      "That will help as tens of thousands of displaced civilians plod back toward their towns and villages across the enclave, to assess the damage caused to their homes, and attempt to make use of whatever they can salvage from the ruins.",
      "Thousands of families have started walking or dragging carts from displacement camps in Gaza City toward the razed towns and cities of Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip.",
      "They have also been returning to the southern city of Rafah, where CBS News' team spoke with one girl wearing a dress in the pattern of the Palestinian flag.",
      "\"This is the moment that all of Gaza's citizens were waiting for,\" she said. \"Thank God the war has ended\u2026 It is time to celebrate after enduring the pain. It is time to reconstruct after all of the destruction. Gaza's children are drawing a new future.\"",
      "Civil Defense rescue teams have continued recovering the decomposing bodies of dozens of people killed during the war, both from underneath the rubble of destroyed buildings and from the streets. The Civil Defense has estimated that some 10,000 bodies could still be buried under the rubble of demolished homes in Gaza.",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said Monday that hospitals across the enclave had received the bodies of 122 people recovered since the ceasefire took effect alone, including 62 pulled from rubble, raising the total number of fatalities in Gaza since the war began to 47,035. The ministry does not distinguish between combatant and civilian casualties, but says the vast majority of those killed have been civilians, including tens of thousands of women and children.",
      "Joyous reunions for 3 Israeli families, hope for dozens more",
      "A Red Cross convoy driving into Gaza City on Sunday was the first sign that Hamas was keeping its end of the bargain.\u00a0 But the hostage handover was chaotic; heavily armed Hamas fighters surrounded and climbed over the vehicles \u2014 a clear display of force and resilience after more than a year of war against Israel's vastly superior military.",
      "But soon the world and the desperate families back home got a first glimpse of the three women being released as they bolted between cars, and to freedom.",
      "Held hostage in fear for 15 months by Hamas, 24-year-old Romi Gonen, 31-year-old Doron Steinbrecher and 28-year-old Emily Damari were finally on their way to being back in the eager arms of their loved ones. The three women \u2014 including Damari, an Israeli-British national who lost two fingers during the Oct. 7 attack when she was abducted \u2014 were all reunited with their mothers as soon as they reached Israel.",
      "\"Yesterday, I was finally able to give Emily the hug that I have been dreaming of,\" Damari's mother Mandy said in a statement released Monday. \"I am relieved to report that after her release, Emily is doing much better than any of us could ever have anticipated\u2026 In Emily's own words, she is the happiest girl in the world; she has her life back.\"",
      "Even in her moment of intense joy, Mandy Damari stressed that other families were still waiting to share in the elation.",
      "\"We must also remember that 94 other hostages still remain,\" she said. \"The ceasefire must continue and every last hostage must be returned to their families.\"",
      "Hundreds of Israelis watching from Hostage Square in Tel Aviv also shared in the joy Sunday night \u2014 including some whose own loved ones didn't make it out of Hamas captivity \u2014 or haven't yet.",
      "Gil Dickmann's cousin Carmel Gat was among those kidnapped. Her body was recovered during an Israeli military operation at the beginning of September. Still, Dickmann has regularly attended the demonstrations in Hostage Square calling for the return of the dozens of others. He told CBS News that when he saw the women emerge from the vehicles on Sunday, he struggled to even believe it.",
      "\"My God, it's them,\" he said he'd told himself. \"All the people around the world should have this joy - of people coming back home alive. It is still the happiest thing that you can ever, ever live through.\"",
      "Celebrations in the West Bank as Palestinian prisoners released",
      "There was elation and celebrations in the Israeli occupied West Bank late on Sunday night, too, as 90 Palestinian detainees, mostly women, were released in exchange for the freed hostages.",
      "\"They were treating us like animals,\" said 18-year-old Rose Quis.",
      "\"I left hell, and now I'm in heaven,\" said Abdelaziz Atawneh  as he emerged from Israel's Ofer prison, just outside the West Bank city of Ramallah.",
      "The freed detainees were greeted by fireworks, whistling and shouts of \"God is great,\" and many were hoisted onto the shoulders of the massive crowds that had gathered outside the prison \u2014 many of them waiting all day for the release.",
      "According to a list provided by the Palestinian Authority, which administers the West Bank, all of those released in the very early hours of Monday were women or teenagers, the youngest just 15. They were jailed by Israel, many of them without formal charges, for alleged offenses ranging from throwing stones to attempted murder.",
      "The next swap of hostages for prisoners is scheduled to take place on Saturday under the ceasefire deal, with four hostages to be released in exchange for about 120 Palestinian prisoners. In total, 33 Israeli hostages are to be released during the first six-week phase of the agreement.",

      "The family of the doctor broke into tears, saying they were \"shocked\" at the sentence and had hoped her murderer would be hanged. But Judge Anirban Das said the case did not deserve the death penalty as it was not \"the rarest of the rare cases,\" and ordered that Roy must spend his life behind bars.",
      "The killing of the 31-year-old physician while she was on duty at a hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the country. Police discovered the woman's bloodied body at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital's seminar hall last Aug. 9. An autopsy found she had been strangled and sexually assaulted.",
      "Federal police, who investigated the case, said the crime deserved the death penalty. Parents of the victim had also sought the death penalty for Roy and said they suspected more people were involved in the crime.",
      "The case was initially investigated by Kolkata police but later the court handed over the probe to federal investigators after state government officers were accused of mishandling the investigation.",
      "After the assault, doctors and medical students across India held protests and rallies demanding better security. Thousands of women also protested in the streets demanding swift justice for the victim.",
      "Indian doctors in government hospitals across several states also staged a strike to protest the rape and murder.",
      "Roy was arrested a day after the crime, and arguments in the case began in November. The assault prompted India's Supreme Court to set up a national task force to suggest ways to enhance safety in government hospitals.",
      "The victim's mother and father, who were seated close to Roy in court on Monday, have said they wanted Roy to be executed.",

      "Many cases of\u00a0crimes against women\u00a0go unreported in India due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence, as well as a lack of faith in the police. Women's rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where the community sometimes shames victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing.",
      "The nationwide outrage and protests were similar to those seen after the\u00a02012 gang-rape and murder\u00a0of a young woman on a moving New Delhi bus. That vicious attack prompted India to enact tougher laws against sexual violence, but according to the latest available government data, as recently as 2022 authorities were still registering about 90 rapes on average per day.",

      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Biden last week of a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\" The group's sharp-edged report, titled \"Takers Not Makers,\" also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation - including his own - and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\"What you're seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\" Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\"It's not about one specific individual. It's the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\" he added.",
      "Like Biden's call for making billionaires \"begin to pay their fair share\" through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam - a global advocacy group - called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \"dismantle the new aristocracy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Three Israeli hostages were released Sunday as part of a long-awaited ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. They are the first of 33 that Hamas is expected to free during the first phase of the deal.",
      "Early Monday, more than seven hours later, Israel released 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.",
      "Facilitated by the Red Cross, the Israeli hostages were transferred to the Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Authority just after 5:30 p.m. local time and crossed the border into Israeli territory shortly after that, those agencies said in a joint announcement. Both IDF special forces and ISA forces accompanied the freed hostages out of Gaza.",
      "\"The commanders and soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces salute and embrace the released hostages as they make their way home to the State of Israel,\" the agencies said.",
      "The hostages released were confirmed as 24-year-old Romi Gonen, 31-year-old Doron Steinbrecher and 28-year-old Emily Damari.",
      "Israeli authorities said the freed hostages underwent initial medical evaluations at a reception point in southern Israel once they returned. After those checks, they boarded a military helicopter set to take them to other hospitals.",
      "A large bus carrying dozens of Palestinian detainees exited the gates of Israel's Ofer prison, just outside the West Bank city of Ramallah.",
      "Israel's military, which occupies the West Bank, warned Palestinians against public celebration, but crowds thronged the buses after they left the prison, some people climbing on top or waving flags, including those of Hamas.",
      "There were fireworks and whistles, and shouts of \"God is great.\" Those released were hoisted onto others' shoulders or embraced.",
      "According to a list provided by the Palestinian Authority's Commission for Prisoners' Affairs, all of those released are women or teens, the youngest 15. Israel detained them for what it said were offenses related to Israel's security, from throwing stones to more serious accusations like attempted murder.",
      "The IDF shared a video of the three Israeli women's mothers watching footage of their daughters' return from an Israeli soldier's phone at the reception point.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they had endured a horrific ordeal.",
      "\"I know, we all know, they have been through hell. They are emerging from darkness into light, from bondage to freedom,\" he said.",
      "\"They appear to be in good health,\" President Biden said in brief remarks as they were arriving in Israel.",
      "Brett McGurk, the Biden administration National Security Council coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he had spoken to his Israeli counterparts about the conditions of the hostages.",
      "\"I know they're alive,\" McGurk said. \"They've been held in deplorable conditions over 470 days, but the Israelis have a very good system to take them into their care, and they're going to get the care they need and be reunited with their families.\"",
      "The ceasefire officially began earlier Sunday after a last-minute delay of almost three hours. The fighting continued past the initially provisioned 8:30 a.m. local (1:30 a.m. Eastern) deadline as the Israeli military said Hamas had failed to provide the names of the first three hostages due to be released, per the terms of the agreement.",
      "In Gaza, fighter jets and drones were reported to have disappeared from the skies as the deal took effect, and at least 191 aid trucks were said to have begun entering into Gaza through the Karem Shalom crossing.",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire calls for Hamas to release 33 hostages over a six-week period. They include women, children and hostages over 50 years old, a draft viewed by CBS News said.",
      "The plan says three living female hostages will be returned on Day 1. Four hostages will be released on Day 7, and the remaining 26 over the next five weeks.",
      "The pause \u2014 the second in the 15-month-long war \u2014 was achieved through joint pressure from President-elect Donald Trump and the outgoing administration of President Biden.",
      "McGurk said the deal was \"not put together in the last week.\"",
      "\"It's a detailed, complex arrangement to leave nothing to chance,\" McGurk said. \"And even up to last night, I was up until 4 o'clock in the morning, when this finally went into place to make sure that everything went according to the plan.\"",
      "Rep. Mike Waltz, who will serve as national security adviser in the incoming Trump administration, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" that \"this deal would have never happened had President Trump not been elected.\"",
      "Waltz said \"if Hamas reneges on this deal, if Hamas backs out, moves the goal post, what have you we will support Israel in doing what it has to do, number one, and number two, Hamas will never govern Gaza.\"",
      "\"President Trump's plan and his first term, his plan for the Middle East and his plan for Israel and Palestine had a pathway to a two-state with all kinds of very important qualifiers that had to be in place beforehand,\" Waltz said. \"Stop radicalizing the next generation of Palestinian youth. Very specifics- components of that plan in terms of how things would be divided up, but I do think we can get to the next round of the Abraham accords.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Biden and Qatar's prime minister separately announced the deal after a week of intense negotiations mediated by Qatar, the U.S. and Egypt.",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump welcomed the impending release of the three hostages.",
      "\"Hostages starting to come out today! Three wonderful young women will be first,\" he wrote Sunday morning.",
      "In a rare meeting during the Jewish Sabbath, Israel's full Cabinet voted to approve the deal.",
      "The approval set off a flurry of activity and a fresh wave of emotions as relatives wondered whether hostages would be returned alive or dead.",
      "How the hostage release will work",
      "Under the negotiated deal, the ceasefire will be in three phases.",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire will last 42 days, and negotiations on the far more difficult second phase are meant to begin just over two weeks in.",
      "After six weeks of the first phase, Israel's security cabinet will decide how to proceed.",
      "In total, Hamas would release 33 hostages during the first phase. Hamas would start releasing hostages on the first day, initially returning three to Israel, according to the draft viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release four hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release three hostages every seven days, starting with the living, and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During each exchange, Palestinian prisoners will be released by Israel after the hostages have arrived safely.",
      "Mr. Biden said Wednesday that Americans would be among the hostages released in the first phase of the agreement, but he did not specify any names or how soon they would be freed.",
      "In phase one, Israel will release at least 1,700 Palestinian prisoners, including 1,167 Gaza residents who were not involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack that sparked the war. All women and children under 19 from Gaza held by Israel will be freed during this phase.",
      "The remainder of the hostages in Gaza, including male Israeli soldiers, are to be released in a second phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal.",
      "When does fighting stop",
      "During the ceasefire's first phase, Israeli troops are to pull back into a buffer zone about a half mile wide inside Gaza along its borders with Israel.",
      "In the interim between 8:30 a.m. and when the ceasefire took hold, Israeli fire killed at least 26 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It did not say whether they were civilians or fighters. The military has warned people to stay away from Israeli forces as they retreat to a buffer zone inside Gaza.",
      "Despite the caveats and uncertainty, anticipation was high.",
      "\"The first thing I will do is go and check my house,\" Mohamed Mahdi, a father of two who was displaced from Gaza City's Zaytoun neighborhood, told the Associated Press. He also looked forward to seeing family in southern Gaza, but is \"still concerned that one of us could be martyred before we are able to meet.\"",
      "Aid was starting to arrive slowly in Gaza on Sunday. Save the Children president and CEO Janti Soeripto told \"Face the Nation\" that as of Sunday afternoon local time, her organization had \"60 trucks waiting in that queue, all loaded up with warm clothing, shoes for kids, pallets with medicines, malnutrition treatment, which is sorely needed.\"",
      "Save the Chlidren is trying to connect 17,000 displaced Gazan children with their families, which Soeripto described as a \"long and hard, painstaking process that also needs real sensitive and professional social workers.\"",
      "\"It's going to be a huge effort,\" Soeripto said. \"You know, It's a real moment of hope and peril at the same time.\"",
      "The Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed approximately 1,200 people in Israel and left some 250 captive. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza.",
      "Israel responded with an offensive that has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants, but says women and children make up more than half the dead.",

      "The long-awaited ceasefire and hostage release deal\u00a0between Hamas and Israel that had been set to go into effect on Sunday morning in the Middle East was delayed, with Israel's military accusing Hamas of failing to provide the names of the first hostages to be released. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari gave a statement at the intended start time, 8:30 a.m. local (1:30 a.m. Eastern) and said Hamas wasn't complying with the agreement as the names of the hostages were not yet transferred.",
      "\"According to the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu], the ceasefire will not come into effect as long as Hamas does not fulfill its commitment to the agreement,\" said Hagari, warning that \"any violation of the agreement will have a full security significance.\"",
      "He said Israel's military \"continues to attack, even now, inside the Gaza arena,\" and would do so until Hamas complies with the agreement.",
      "A short time after, the Israeli prime minister's office announced that it had received a the list of names of the first hostages to be released and said the first phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal would come into effect at 11:15 a.m. local time (4:15 a.m. Eastern).",
      "Hamas blamed the delay in handing over the names on \"technical field reasons.\" It said in a statement that it was still committed to the ceasefire deal announced last week, but there was no indication how long implementation of the agreement could be delayed.",
      "CBS News' team inside Gaza confirmed that IDF strikes were ongoing in both the north and central parts of the Palestinian territory. According to initial reports, at least three people were killed by gunfire in the north, and there were reports of IDF troops opening fire on people trying to return to their homes in the decimated southern city of Rafah.",
      "Qatar's foreign minister, Majid al-Ansari, had posted Saturday on X that the ceasefire would start at 8:30 a.m. local time in Gaza on Sunday. He advised people to exercise caution when the agreement came into effect and to wait for directions from officials.",
      "But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later warned that a ceasefire won't go forward unless Israel receives the names of hostages to be released, as had been agreed.",
      "\"Israel will not tolerate violations of the agreement. Hamas is solely responsible,\" he said in a statement.",
      "His statement came almost three hours after Israel had expected to receive the names, which Hamas was to give to mediator Qatar. There was no immediate response from Hamas or Qatar.",
      "The prime minister, speaking to the nation about 12 hours before the ceasefire is set to start, also said Israel is treating the ceasefire with Gaza as temporary and retains the right to continue fighting if necessary. He claimed that he had the support of President-elect Donald Trump, who he said he spoke with Wednesday.",
      "Early Saturday morning local time, Israel's Cabinet approved the deal for a ceasefire in Gaza that would see the release of dozens of hostages and pause the 15-month war with Hamas. The deal brings the two sides a step closer to ending their deadliest and most destructive fighting ever.",
      "\"We hope by the name of God that today is the last day of war,\" a displaced man from southern Gaza told CBS News.",
      "How the ceasefire and hostage deal works",
      "According to a translated draft of the agreement viewed by CBS News, and as described by President Biden, the deal consists of three phases, each lasting 42 days.",
      "Hamas would start releasing hostages on the first day, initially returning three to Israel, according to the draft viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release four hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release three hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "It would release 33 women and children hostages in total during the first phase, as well as hostages over 50 years old, the draft viewed by CBS News said.",
      "Mr. Biden said Wednesday that Americans would be among the hostages released in this phase, but he did not specify any names or how soon they would be freed.",
      "The remainder of the hostages, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Eli David, the brother of Eyvatar David, who has been held hostage by Hamas since the attack on Oct. 7, 2023, told CBS News' Remy Inocencio that he has mixed feelings as the ceasefire nears. Eyvatar is set to be released in the second phase.",
      "\"If they have a heart, if they can feel empathy, if they know my brother, just send him a message,\" Eli David said as a message to Hamas. \"Tell him that we are fighting for him, that we love him and we are so hopeful we know that he's coming back home.\"",
      "The plan says that during phase one, some 1,900 Palestinian prisoners will be released, in exchange for 33 Israeli hostages, both alive and dead. Among the prisoners, 1,167 are residents of Gaza who were held by Israel but were not involved in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack. All women and children under 19 from Gaza held by Israel will be freed during this phase.",
      "According to the ceasefire plan, approved by the Cabinet and signed by Israel's national security adviser, the exchange will begin Sunday at 9 a.m. EST. During each exchange, prisoners will be released by Israel after the hostages have arrived safely.",
      "Missile strikes continue while aid is on the way",
      "Despite the ceasefire news, sirens sounded across central Israel on Saturday, with the army saying it intercepted projectiles launched from Yemen.",
      "The Iran-backed Houthis have stepped up their missile attacks, in recent weeks. The group says the attacks are part of their campaign aimed at pressuring Israel and the West over the war in Gaza.",
      "There were also continued Israeli strikes into Gaza. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 23 people were killed in the previous day.",
      "Also, during the first phase, Israeli troops are to pull back into a buffer zone about a kilometer (0.6 miles) wide inside Gaza, along its borders with Israel.",
      "That will allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes, including in Gaza City and northern Gaza. With most of Gaza's population driven into massive, squalid tent camps, Palestinians are desperate to get back to their homes, even though many were destroyed or heavily damaged by Israel's campaign.",
      "The largely devastated territory should also see a surge in humanitarian aid. Trucks carrying aid lined up Friday on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.",
      "On Saturday, two Egyptian government ministers arrived in the northern Sinai Peninsula to oversee the preparations for the delivery of aid and to receive the evacuation of wounded patients, the health ministry said.",
      "Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack into Israel that killed some 1,200 people and left some 250 others captive. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza.",
      "Israel responded with a devastating offensive that has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half the dead.",

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 15:05:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Yoon's lawyers could also file a petition to challenge the court's arrest warrant.",
    "story": [
      "South Korea's impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, was formally arrested early Sunday, days after being apprehended at his presidential compound in Seoul, as he faces possible imprisonment over his ill-fated declaration of martial law last month.",
      "Yoon's arrest could mark the beginning of an extended period in custody for him, lasting months or more.",
      "The Seoul Western District Court granted law enforcement's request for an arrest warrant for Yoon following an hourslong deliberation, saying he was a threat to destroy evidence. Yoon and his lawyers on Saturday appeared before the court's judge during a hearing and argued for his release.",
      "Yoon, who has been in detention since he was apprehended on Wednesday in a massive law enforcement operation at his residential compound, faces potential rebellion charges linked to his declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, which set off the country's most serious political crisis since its democratization in the late 1980s.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and the military, can now extend his detention to 20 days, during which they will transfer the case to public prosecutors for indictment.",
      "Yoon's lawyers could also file a petition to challenge the court's arrest warrant.",
      "Yoon's appearance at the Seoul Western District Court triggered chaotic scenes in nearby streets, where thousands of his fervent supporters rallied for hours calling for his release. They clashed with police, who detained around 40 protesters, including about 20 who climbed over a fence in an attempt to approach the court. At least two vehicles carrying anti-corruption investigators were damaged as they left the court after arguing for Yoon's arrest.",
      "Yoon's lawyers said he spoke for about 40 minutes to the judge during the nearly five-hour closed-door hearing. His legal team and anti-corruption agencies presented opposing arguments about whether he should be held in custody. The lawyers did not share his specific comments.",
      "The judge is expected to make a decision by late Saturday or early Sunday. Yoon's motorcade was seen leaving the court Saturday evening for the detention center, where Yoon will await the decision.",
      "Yoon was transported to the court from a detention center in Uiwang, near Seoul, in a blue Justice Ministry van escorted by police and the presidential security service.",
      "The motorcade entered the court's basement parking space as thousands of Yoon's supporters gathered in nearby streets despite a heavy police presence. Some protesters broke through the police lines and tapped on the windows of his van approaching the court. Yoon did not speak to reporters.",
      "After its investigators were attacked by protesters, the anti-corruption agency asked media companies to obscure the faces of its members attending the hearing.",
      "It hadn't been clear until Saturday morning whether Yoon would choose to attend the hearing.",
      "Defense lawyers met Yoon at the detention center and he accepted his legal team's advice to appear personally before the judge, said Yoon Kab-keun, one of the president's lawyers. The lawyer said the president was to argue that his decree was a legitimate exercise of his powers and that accusations of rebellion would not hold up before a criminal court or the Constitutional Court, which is reviewing whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "Nine people, including Yoon's defense minister, police chief, and several top military commanders, have already been arrested and indicted for their roles in the enforcement of martial law.",
      "The crisis began when Yoon, in an attempt to break through legislative gridlock, imposed military rule and sent troops to the National Assembly and election offices. The standoff lasted only hours after lawmakers who managed to get through a blockade voted to lift the measure. The opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14.",
      "If Yoon is formally arrested, it could mark the beginning of an extended period in custody for him, lasting months or more.",
      "If prosecutors indict Yoon on rebellion and abuse of power charges, which are the allegations now being examined by investigators, they could keep him in custody for up to six months before trial.",
      "Under South Korean law, orchestrating a rebellion is punishable by life imprisonment or the death penalty.",
      "Yoon's lawyers have argued that there is no need to detain him during the investigation, saying he doesn't pose a threat to flee or destroy evidence.",

      "Protests erupted in West Bengal last August to demand justice after the body of a 31-year-old trainee doctor was found with multiple injuries in a lecture hall in Kolkata's state-run R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital. Authorities at the time said the woman had gone to the lecture hall to rest during a night shift when she was attacked.",
      "An autopsy later found the victim had been raped and assaulted before she died. It also suggested she resisted and may have been tortured before being murdered.",
      "Roy was arrested a day after the crime but was not officially charged until nearly two months later. He has since consistently maintained his innocence and told the court that he was not guilty.",
      "The trial in the case was fast-tracked through India's notoriously sluggish legal system and arguments began in November. It also highlighted once again the chronic issue of violence against women in the country.",
      "After the incident, doctors and medical students across India held protests and rallies demanding justice and better security for them. Thousands of women across the country also protested on the streets, demanding justice for the victim as they participated in \"Reclaim The Night\" marches. Some protesters called for the perpetrator of the crime to be given the death penalty.",
      "The incident highlighted rising sexual violence against women in India and prompted India's Supreme Court to set up a national task force that suggested ways to enhance safety measures in government hospitals.",
      "Many cases of\u00a0crimes against women\u00a0go unreported in India due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence, as well as a lack of faith in the police. Women's rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where the community sometimes shames victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing.",
      "Still, the number of recorded rape cases in the country has increased. In 2022, police recorded 31,516 reports of rape \u2014 a 20% jump from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.",
      "In 2012, the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus galvanized massive protests across India. It inspired lawmakers to order harsher penalties for such crimes, as well as the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases. The government also introduced the death penalty for repeat offenders.",
      "The rape law amended in 2013 also criminalized stalking and voyeurism and lowered the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16.",

      "Herd - who is also curator of the university's meteorite collection\u00a0- arrived at the scene 10 days after the possible meteorite crash to document the origin of the fragments found by the homeowners. They picked up 7 grams of the rock from the grass next to the walkway and retrieved more samples using a vacuum and a magnet. Herd also measured a 2 x 2 cm divot in the walkway formed by the impact.",

      "Obesity is a \"spectrum,\" he said, rather than a \"single, distinct clinical entity.\"",

      "\"As these categories of obesity are entirely new, we can\u2019t measure their relative prevalence in the population,\" Rubino noted. \"Doctors have not yet had the possibility to make such a diagnosis, because many of the organ dysfunctions that characterize clinical obesity have not been routinely assessed so far.\"",
      "When excess body fat is confirmed, clinicians should assess individuals to determine whether obesity may have caused any organ dysfunction, the study researcher said. (iStock)",

      "Many judges have tacked on four little words, \"so help me God.\" It is not legally or constitutionally required, unlike other federal oaths that invoke the words as standard procedure. Historians have been at odds over whether President Washington established precedent by adding the phrase on his own during his first acceptance, but contemporary accounts mention no such ad-libbing.",
      "Abraham Lincoln was reported to have said it spontaneously in 1861, and other presidents over the years have followed suit. A Bible is traditionally used, with the president placing one hand on it while raising the other during the oath of office.",
      "The Constitution also does not require the president or members of Congress or federal judges to be sworn in by a Supreme Court justice, though they just have for inaugurations, most of the time.",

      "The president returns to power with more GOP unity than he had in 2016. Congressional Republicans were far from standing foursquare behind him. House Republicans had 241 seats then. His most ardent supporters on Capitol Hill were people who no longer serve. Former Reps. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., and Duncan Hunter Jr., R-Calif., were his first supporters in the House. Both were convicted on unrelated criminal matters and left Congress. Trump then pardoned them. His biggest advocate in the Senate was former Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. Sessions left the Senate to serve as Trump\u2019s first attorney general. He lasted less than two years, stepping down at the president\u2019s request.",
      "Congressional Republicans were skeptical of Trump back then. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., led the charge to unwind ObamaCare. After the GOP had to pull the bill in the House, Republicans finally cobbled together the votes to kill it a month later. The bill stumbled in the Senate after the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted no. But the House failure on the first try told you everything you needed to know about where the party stood and how much influence Trump wielded.",

      "It will be about the math. Despite their ambitious legislative ambitions to approve tranches of money for the border \u2013 but simultaneously slash spending and cut taxes. And Republicans have a miniscule majority in the House. With the resignation of former Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., to become national security adviser, House Republicans will be down to 218 votes. That majority dwindles to 217 when Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., resigns to become ambassador to the United Nations \u2013 presuming she receives Senate confirmation.",

      "Scammers are taking advantage of this. They have come up with a new trick where they pretend to be recruiters to spread crypto miners on people\u2019s devices.",
      "It starts with an email inviting the person to schedule an interview for a job. But when they click the link, it installs a malicious app that secretly mines cryptocurrency.\u00a0This app hijacks your PC\u2019s resources, like the CPU and GPU, which slows down its performance significantly.",

      "What you need to know",
      "This malicious campaign begins with an email that tricks victims into thinking it is part of a recruitment process, as reported by\u00a0Dark Reading. In most cases, these emails are pretending to be from recruiters at the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "The fraudulent email contains a link claiming to take the recipient to a site where they can schedule an interview. However, in reality, it redirects the victim to a malicious website that offers a download for a supposed \"CRM application.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The site provides download options for both Windows and macOS. Regardless of which option the victim selects, the download will be a Windows executable written in Rust. This executable then downloads the XMRig cryptominer.",
      "The executable performs several environmental checks to analyze the device and avoid detection. It scans running processes, checks the CPU and more. If the device passes these checks, the executable will display a fake error message while secretly downloading additional payloads needed to run the XMRig miner.",

      "How does a cryptominer affect your PC?",
      "A cryptomining app can significantly impact your PC\u2019s performance. Once installed, it hijacks your computer's resources, including the CPU and GPU, to secretly mine cryptocurrency. This process requires a lot of computational power, which can cause your system to slow down drastically. You might notice your computer becoming unresponsive, running hotter than usual, or consuming more power.",
      "In some cases, prolonged use of cryptominers can also lead to hardware damage due to the increased strain on your components. Additionally, these miners often run in the background without your knowledge, making it harder to detect the issue until the damage is already done.",
      "CrowdStrike is aware of the scam and advises individuals to stay vigilant.\u00a0\"This campaign highlights the importance of vigilance against phishing scams, particularly those targeting job seekers. Individuals in the recruitment process should verify the authenticity of CrowdStrike communications and avoid downloading unsolicited files,\" the\u00a0company said in a blog post.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from job interview scams",
      "1. Check if you applied for the job: If you receive an unsolicited interview invitation, think back to whether you actually applied for that job or company. Scammers often target jobseekers randomly, hoping someone takes the bait. If you didn't apply, it's likely a scam. Always confirm directly with the company before proceeding.",
      "2. Verify recruiter credentials:\u00a0Always double-check the recruiter\u2019s details before responding to an email or clicking any links. Verify their email address, LinkedIn profile and company association. Legitimate companies will use official email domains, not free services like Gmail or Yahoo.",
      "3. Avoid downloading unsolicited files:\u00a0Be cautious of emails asking you to download any files or applications. Legitimate recruitment processes rarely require you to install software. If unsure, contact the company directly to confirm the request.",
      "4. Inspect links before clicking:\u00a0Hover over any links in the email to see their actual URL. Scammers often use URLs that mimic legitimate sites but have subtle differences. If a link looks suspicious, avoid clicking on it.",
      "5. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Use strong antivirus or endpoint protection software to detect and block malicious downloads. Regularly update your security tools to ensure they can handle new threats effectively.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Cybercriminals always manage to come up with new ways to exploit people. While this particular scam is more focused on using your computer\u2019s resources than stealing data, it is still very dangerous. It shows that if a hacker can easily install software on your PC, they can also go ahead and steal your financial information and other personal data. Always verify the emails you receive, and try not to download anything you don\u2019t trust.",

    "story": [
      "Study participants successfully grasped and transported two objects at once without dropping them.",
      "Prosthetic hands have long struggled to replicate the dexterity and functionality of natural hands, often limiting users to a single grasp function at a time.",
      "This limitation has made everyday tasks, such as typing on a keyboard or braiding hair, challenging for those who rely on prosthetics.",

      "Researchers at FAU's College of Engineering and Computer Science, in collaboration with the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, conducted an innovative study that combined haptic feedback, electromyogram control and a wearable soft robotic armband. This study aimed to investigate whether users could control grip forces applied to two different objects simultaneously with a dexterous artificial hand.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The study's findings, published in Scientific Reports, demonstrated that multiple channels of haptic feedback allowed participants to successfully grasp and transport two objects at once without dropping them, even when visual feedback was obstructed.",

      "A key innovation in this research was the development of a multichannel soft robotic armband designed to convey artificial sensations of touch. This armband included soft actuators that provided proportional contact force feedback and vibrotactile stimulators that alerted users if they were about to drop or break an object. The armband's design allowed it to deliver haptic feedback at three critical points corresponding to the thumb, index and little fingers, effectively enhancing the user's ability to control multiple objects simultaneously.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",

Numerous incidents demonstrate that Macs are not impenetrable, and a new one has recently been added to the list. Security researchers have discovered a new variant of stealer malware that targets browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets and other personal data. I\u00a0reported on this malware in 2024 as well. Previously, it relied on macOS browser extensions to steal data.

Elastic Security Labs first highlighted this malware in mid-2024, noting that it operates as malware-as-a-service, a business model in which cybercriminals provide access to malicious software and related infrastructure for a fee. At that time, it was available for as much as $3,000 per month.",
      "Check Point says this malware evolved in September after being exposed. This time, its developers had \"stolen\" a string encryption algorithm from Apple\u2019s own XProtect antivirus engine, which replaced the plain text strings used in the original version. Since antivirus programs expect to see this kind of encryption from Apple\u2019s legitimate security tools, they weren\u2019t flagged as suspicious, allowing the BanShee to remain undetected and quietly steal data from targeted devices.",

      "BanShee Stealer is a prime example of how advanced malware has become. Once it\u2019s on a system, it gets straight to work stealing all kinds of sensitive information. It goes after data from browsers like Chrome, Brave, Edge and Vivaldi, as well as cryptocurrency wallet extensions. It even takes advantage of two-factor authentication (2FA) extensions to grab credentials. On top of that, it collects details about the device\u2019s software and hardware, as well as the external IP address.",
      "The Mac malware also tricks users with fake pop-ups that look like real system prompts, tricking victims into entering their macOS passwords. Once it has gathered the stolen information, BanShee exfiltrates it to command-and-control servers, using encrypted and encoded files to ensure the data remains secure.",
      "The malware\u2019s creators used GitHub repositories to spread BanShee. They set up fake repositories that looked like they hosted popular software, complete with stars and reviews, to seem trustworthy. These campaigns didn\u2019t just target macOS users with BanShee. They also hit Windows users with a different\u00a0malware called Lumma Stealer. Over three waves, the attackers used these fake repositories to trick people into downloading their malicious files.",

      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links. Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3)\u00a0Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4)\u00a0Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5)\u00a0Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "No device is immune to cyberattacks when a human operator is involved. Take the BanShee Stealer, for example. It managed to target Macs not due to weak cybersecurity measures by Apple but because it successfully tricked users into installing it and granting the required permissions. Most breaches, hacks and other cyberattacks stem from human error. This highlights the importance of maintaining basic cybersecurity hygiene.

      "\"Lone wolf actors are always extremely significant to law enforcement personnel who are trying to safeguard the people that are attending these events,\" Sergeant Matthew Fagiana, a retired patrol commander with over 25 years of experience with law enforcement, told Fox News Digital. \"One of the reasons that they're always a concern is they can be very unpredictable, and they are driven by extremist ideologies.\"",
      "The threat of potential lone wolf actors was heightened after a machete-wielding suspect attempted to get through a magnetometer and X-ray security screen as Trump was paying respect to former President Carter. The 44-year-old suspect was granted a conditional pre-trial release after a hearing just days prior to Trump's inauguration.",

      "The vote caps a 14-year career for Rubio in the Senate. He ran for president in 2016, losing the Republican nomination to Trump. The two mended fences in subsequent years and Rubio has embraced many of Trump's ideas.",
      "Every new president since Bill Clinton has had at least one cabinet-level nominee confirmed on inauguration day, and the Rubio vote continues that trend.",
      "\u201cWe have a job to do, and advice and consent is part of it. So, we\u2019re going to take that role seriously. Our senators take that role seriously, Republican and Democrat, and we will,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Monday on the \u201cTODAY\u201d show. \u201cBut we also understand that we have a job to do, and I think it was spelled out very clearly by the voters in November.\u201d",
      "Each nominee requires 51 votes to secure confirmation in the Senate. But Democrats can delay votes by several days if they refuse to fast-track them to the floor.",
      "\u201cWe will neither rubber-stamp nominees who we feel are grossly unqualified, nor will we reflexively oppose nominees that deserve serious consideration,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., outlining the Democrats\u2019 philosophy on Trump picks.",
      "Senate committees also voted to advance four other Trump nominees on Monday.",
      "The Senate Intelligence Committee voted 14-3 to send John Ratcliffe\u2019s nomination to be CIA director to the full Senate, a spokesperson for the committee said. It's not clear he'll be fast-tracked to the floor.",
      "The Senate Armed Services Committee voted 14-13, along party lines, for Pete Hegseth\u2019s nomination to be secretary of defense. He faces fierce Democratic opposition.",
      "And the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Committee voted to advance Russell Vought's nomination as White House budget director, 8-7, and Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary, 13-2.",
      "The nominees who get a majority vote in committee will be sent to the full chamber. From there, it\u2019ll take an agreement among all senators to allow a floor vote on any of them.",
      "The Senate has a tradition of prioritizing votes on national security nominees under a new administration.",
      "On Jan. 20, 2021, Avril Haines, then-President Joe Biden's pick to be director of national intelligence, was confirmed. And on Jan. 20, 2017, several of Trump\u2019s nominees were confirmed, including John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Ultimately, Thune predicted all of Trump's picks can be confirmed.",
      "\u201cI think they all have a path to get there,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, some haven\u2019t had their confirmation hearings yet, so I always reserve judgment until they come out of the committee because that\u2019s where they get the hard questions. And I think it\u2019s important that that process play out, and what I\u2019ve guaranteed is a fair process.\u201d"

    "summary": "The Senate Armed Services Committee voted along party lines to send Pete Hegseth\u2019s nomination to be defense secretary to the Senate floor.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate Armed Services Committee voted Monday along party lines to send Pete Hegseth\u2019s nomination to be defense secretary to the Senate floor as President Donald Trump tries to move quickly to get critical members of his Cabinet in place.",
      "All 14 Republicans on the committee voted in favor of Hegseth, while all 13 Democrats voted against him. Despite initial concerns about allegations of sexual assault, alcohol abuse and financial mismanagement \u2014 all of which Hegseth has denied \u2014 not a single Republican senator has said so far that he or she will vote no, meaning he is most likely on track to be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Thursday is the soonest that vote would occur in the full Senate unless all 100 members agree to move things along more quickly.",
      "Trump\u2019s decision in November to choose Hegseth, 44, a former Fox News host who served in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars with the Army National Guard, stunned many in Washington given that he had limited military command or significant management experience. And in the weeks that followed, Hegseth\u2019s nomination appeared on the verge of collapse amid reports that he paid a settlement to a woman who had accused him of sexual assault in a hotel room in 2017 and that he had a history of excessive drinking on the job, including at Fox News.",
      "Hegseth denied all of the allegations, vowed that he wouldn\u2019t touch alcohol if he were confirmed to lead the Pentagon and said Trump had told him to \u201ckeep going, keep fighting.\u201d",
      "At his Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing last Tuesday, Hegseth faced fierce questions from Democrats about his drinking issues, allegations of infidelity, workplace misconduct and experience. Multiple senators questioned him about his public comments that women should not serve in combat roles. He replied that he now believes women should have access to combat roles as long as \"standards remain high.\"",
      "But the most pointed questions came from Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who zeroed in on the allegation of an assault in a hotel in Monterrey, California. Local police investigated the incident, and prosecutors did not file charges.",
      "\u201cSo you think you are completely cleared because you committed no crime. That\u2019s your definition of cleared. You had just fathered a child two months before by a woman that was not your wife,\u201d Kaine told Hegseth in a testy exchange. \u201cI am shocked that you would stand here and say you\u2019re completely cleared.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was completely cleared,\u201d Hegseth replied.",
      "\u201cThe incident in Monterey led to a criminal charge, a criminal investigation, a private settlement and a cash payment to the woman who filed the complaint. And there was also a nondisclosure agreement, correct?\u201d Kaine went on. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you inform the commander in chief and the transition team of this very relevant event?\u201d",
      "Just four GOP senators could team with all 47 Democratic senators to derail Hegseth\u2019s nomination. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, an Iraq war veteran and sexual assault survivor, was seen as a possible defection, along with a pair of moderate GOP senators who have broken with Trump in the past, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.",
      "But after Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Ernst, a member of the Armed Services Committee who faces re-election in 2026, said she would support Hegseth\u2019s nomination.",
      "\u201cOur next commander in chief selected Pete Hegseth to serve in this role, and after our conversations, hearing from Iowans, and doing my job as a United States Senator, I will support President Trump\u2019s pick for Secretary of Defense,\u201d Ernst said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAs I serve on the Armed Services Committee,\u201d she said, \u201cI will work with Pete to create the most lethal fighting force and hold him to his commitments of auditing the Pentagon, ensuring opportunity for women in combat while maintaining high standards, and selecting a senior official to address and prevent sexual assault in the ranks.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 20 Jan 2025 22:47:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Vivek Ramaswamy will launch a campaign for governor in Ohio early next week and is parting ways with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming DOGE.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vivek Ramaswamy will launch a campaign for governor in Ohio early next week and is parting ways with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, two sources familiar with his plans told NBC News.",
      "Ramaswamy\u2019s interest in seeking office in his home state is not a surprise. But his decision to leave DOGE now removes him from the high command of a federal spending watchdog group that he was supposed to run with Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO and owner of X.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s leaving DOGE. He\u2019s going to announce early next week for governor,\u201d said one of the sources, who was granted anonymity to discuss preparations for a campaign that has not officially launched. \u201cIt became increasingly clear over the last week that pursuing the governor\u2019s race and running DOGE was not compatible. He\u2019s leaving on good terms with Trump, Elon and the team.\u201d",
      "A Monday morning post on X, issued around the time that Ramaswamy's departure from DOGE became public, underscored how abruptly he was pivoting away from one of Trump's top priorities.",
      "\"A new dawn,\" Ramaswamy posted alongside a photo of him with Musk.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Trump transition spokesperson Anna Kelly praised Ramaswamy for having played a \"critical role\" in establishing DOGE.",
      "\"He intends to run for elected office soon, which requires him to remain outside of DOGE based on the structure that we announced today,\" Kelly added. \"We thank him immensely for his contributions over the last 2 months and expect him to play a vital role in making America great again!\u201d",
      "Ramaswamy, a wealthy biotech entrepreneur, briefly challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination last year before becoming one of his most visible and vocal allies. He had said that he was putting his Ohio political ambitions on hold to help lead the DOGE effort.",
      "At the time, Ramasway was taking himself out of the running for the appointment to the Senate vacancy in Ohio left by Vice President-elect JD Vance. But Ramaswamy resurfaced as a late contender for that job, meeting last week with Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who eventually selected Lt. Gov. Jon Husted for the post.",
      "That move quickly upended the state\u2019s 2026 race for governor, as Husted was considered a leading candidate to succeed the term-limited DeWine, a fellow Republican. Two other GOP officials with statewide name-recognition \u2014 Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and state Treasurer Robert Sprague \u2014 were already plotting their own bids for governor. And Ramaswamy\u2019s signals last week that he was about to join them only accelerated their preparations.",
      "Ramaswamy mingled with Ohio Republicans at their inaugural ball here Sunday night. But he left conspicuously early, according to three attendees, who were granted anonymity to share details of a private event. His appearance struck these Republicans as unusually perfunctory for someone about to launch a campaign for governor.",
      "\u201cHe can\u2019t bother to spend more than 45 minutes with 1,400 of the most influential Republicans in Ohio,\u201d one GOP leader in the state said. \u201cIt\u2019s next-level arrogance.\u201d",
      "A Ramaswamy adviser did not respond to a question about his appearance.",
      "On the Democratic side, Amy Acton, a physician who served as DeWine\u2019s health director during the early days of Covid, has declared her candidacy for governor."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump declared that the \"golden age of America begins right now\" and vowed that the nation's challenges would be \"annihilated\" by his MAGA movement in a bare-knuckled inaugural address Monday, which echoed the themes and grievances of his trademark rally speeches.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump declared Monday that the \"golden age of America begins right now\" and vowed that the nation's challenges would be \"annihilated\" by his MAGA movement in a bare-knuckled inaugural address that echoed the themes and grievances of his trademark rally speeches.",
      "Trump, in a relatively sedate and focused style, spoke for nearly 40 minutes in the Capitol rotunda after he was sworn in as the United States' 47th president. In a second set of freestyle remarks in the Capitol's Emancipation Hall, Trump attacked political adversaries, called the 2020 election \"totally rigged\" and blamed former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for his supporters' attacking the building on Jan. 6, 2021, in a futile effort to overturn the 2020 election. In the evening, at a rally in Washington's Capital One Arena, Trump went further in assailing Democrats and praising Jan. 6 \"hostages\" who were convicted at trial.",
      "Trump joined Grover Cleveland as the only men to lose the presidency and then reclaim it. He took the oath of office and delivered his inaugural address indoors because of subfreezing temperatures in Washington.",
      "Trump spoke from the perspective of a man on a mission of destiny after surviving a would-be assassin's bullet this summer at a Pennsylvania rally.",
      "\u201cI was\u00a0saved by God\u00a0to make America great again,\u201d Trump said, adding that he wants to be a \u201cpeacemaker and unifier.\u201d",
      "But he also spoke, in the second speech, from the perspective of a man still hung up on past grievances, from his election loss to the investigations into the Jan. 6 riot.",
      "After four years in office, and four years seeking a comeback, his aides say Trump has a much better feel for the levers of power than he did when he was first inaugurated in 2017.",
      "Paired with a sweeping set of executive orders he planned to issue Monday, the first remarks of Trump\u2019s second presidency signaled that he intends to test the limits of presidential power in aggressively pursuing his agenda. But Trump also set a high bar in piling up promises that may be hard to fulfill.",
      "\"I will declare a national emergency at our southern border,\" Trump said. \"All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.\"",
      "Trump used such emergency authority in his first term to try to use military funds to build a border wall \u2014 a move that was frozen by the federal courts.",
      "Trump also said that he would declare Mexican drug cartels foreign terrorist organizations and rename the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "He promised to temper inflation in part by declaring a national energy emergency, promoting drilling for fossil fuels and reversing Biden-era policies aimed at reducing climate change.",
      "The small crowd inside the rotunda, numbering about 500 people, included corporate leaders such as Elon Musk, the SpaceX founder who poured millions of dollars into helping elect Trump and who has become a key adviser to the president. And Trump nodded to his new counselor.",
      "\"We will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars by launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars,\" Trump said. Beaming and holding up two thumbs, Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, shouted, \"Yeah!\"",
      "He also pledged to undertake territorial expansion closer to home, casting his eyes toward the Panama Canal.",
      "\"We didn't give it to China,\" he said. \"We gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\"",
      "Trump also spoke in front of the other four former living presidents \u2014 Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton \u2014 as well as all nine Supreme Court justices, members of his family and lawmakers.",
      "Biden's presence reinstated the tradition of the departing president attending his successor's inauguration, after Trump skipped Biden's swearing-in four years ago. Earlier in the day, Biden and outgoing first lady Jill Biden welcomed Trump and first lady Melania Trump to the White House for tea, reviving another ritual that was ignored four years ago. And in a sign of two-way comity, Trump family members applauded Biden and outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris when they entered the rotunda Monday.",
      "But the past presidents seldom applauded as Trump portrayed himself as the savior of a country in decline.",
      "\"In the United States of America, as we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust,\" he said. \"For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens, while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.\"",
      "On the same day Biden issued pardons to several of his own family members, politicians and former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci, Trump reiterated his view that his four criminal indictments \u2014 and convictions on one set of the charges \u2014 resulted from persecution by the departing president rather than his own actions.",
      "\"The scales of justice will be rebalanced,\" Trump said. \"The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.\"",
      "In his second speech, Trump said he would tackle topics that weren't suited for an inaugural address. Departing sharply from the theme of \"unity\" articulated in the official address, he ripped into Pelosi, Biden and former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who served on the House Jan. 6 committee.",
      "\"I was going to talk about the J6 hostages,\" Trump said, referring to people convicted of crimes related to the riot at the Capitol. \"And I was going to talk about the things that Joe did today with the pardons of people that were very, very guilty of very bad crimes, like the unselect committee of political thugs.\"",
      "Trump reiterated his unsubstantiated claim that the 2020 election \u2014 which he lost \u2014 was \"rigged.\"",
      "Monday's official program ran a little late, and former Ohio Sen. JD Vance was sworn in as vice president by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at noon, the time appointed for the president to take the oath. Vance raised his right hand with his wife, Usha Vance, standing by his side and holding their young daughter \u2014 until the little girl decided it was time to return to the ground. One of their sons held the Bible on which Vance placed his left hand.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts then administered the oath to Trump, who was surrounded by his wife and children. When it was done, Trump smiled broadly, pointed at Roberts and promptly shook hands with Biden.",
      "Before a luncheon in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, Trump began his work, signing a handful of proclamations and political appointments.",
      "At Capital One Arena, Trump signed a series of executive orders and actions that, among other things, rescinded several dozen Biden actions, directed federal agencies to require employees to work in person, and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate pact.",
      "Before affixing his signature to those orders and throwing pens to the crowd, Trump repeatedly mocked Biden, renewed his false assertion that he won the 2020 election, and, with the families of Hamas-held hostages on stage with him, vowed to release the Jan. 6 \"hostages.\"",
      "\"We\u2019re going to decide we\u2019re going to release our great hostages that didn\u2019t do for the most part,\" he said. \"They didn\u2019t do stuff wrong.\"",
      "Over the course of three speeches in one day, Trump's message evolved from one of unity to one of rancor. He pointed to the change at the rally, saying that his staff urged him to avoid confrontation in his official inaugural address.",
      "\"'Don\u2019t talk about Biden with his pardons of his family. We want a unified country,'\" he said of the counsel he received. \"They said, 'Don\u2019t talk about the J6 hostages that you\u2019re going to be releasing today, sir. Don\u2019t put that in your speech, please.'\"",
      "He later said he did not find about Biden's pardons of family members until after he started speaking."

      "A particularly dangerous situation warning is rarely used and warns of extreme danger of fire spread due to dry conditions and low humidity.

      "\u201cWe\u00a0are grateful to the doctors and health care workers who provided her excellent care and the friends, family, and well-wishers who have been by her side during this challenging time,\u201d the family said.",

      "The family told those who would like to celebrate Richards\u2019 memory that \u201cwe invite you to put on some New Orleans jazz, gather with friends and family over a good meal.\u201d",
      "The family ended with a quotation of Richards\u2019 to remember: \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine future generations one day asking: \u2018When there was so much at stake for our country, what did you do?\u2019 The only acceptable answer is: \u2018Everything we could.\u2019\u201d",
      "Richards, the daughter of the late Texas Gov. Ann Richards, previously was deputy chief of staff to Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.",
      "She was president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund from 2006 to 2018. In her last years at the helm of the organization, she faced off with Donald Trump, who, during his first administration, moved to curtail contraception access, tighten abortion restrictions and cut protections for Planned Parenthood services in a number of states.",
      "During his 2016 campaign, Trump pledged to appoint Supreme Court justices who could help overturn Roe v. Wade.\u00a0The landmark case, which guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion, was overturned in June 2022.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been blessed to have always had work that I cared about,\u201d Richards told The Cut last year. \u201cSo many people I\u2019ve worked with and organized, nursing-home workers and hotel workers and janitors, they didn\u2019t have any options. And they worked because they cared about their jobs, but they worked because they had to support a family. But I have been one of the really privileged few that could do what I thought needed doing. And so whatever comes next, I have that.\u201d",
      "Tributes poured in on social media Monday, remembering Richards as a trailblazer for reproductive rights.",
      "Planned Parenthood wrote on X: \u201cWe are heartbroken to lose the indomitable force that is our former president, Cecile Richards. In her 12 devoted years of service to our org, she brought us to new heights in our health care, education, and advocacy work. She was the embodiment of 'Care, no matter what.'",
      "\u201cAs the reproductive freedom movement navigates unchartered territory, we know Cecile would tell us the best way to honor her memory is to suit up (in pink!), link arms, and fight like hell for the health and rights of all people,\u201d it continued.",
      "Former President Joe Biden said Monday, \u201cJill and I are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Cecile Richards.\u201d",
      "\u201cCecile fearlessly led us forward to be the America we say we are. Carrying her mom\u2019s torch for justice, she championed some of our Nation\u2019s most important civil rights causes. She fought for the dignity of workers, defended and advanced women\u2019s reproductive rights and equality, and mobilized our fellow Americans to exercise their power to vote,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cJill and I are sending our love and strength to her husband Kirk, her children Daniel, Hannah, and Lily, her grandson Teddy, and the entire Richards family.\u201d",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris praised Richards as \u201ca force to be reckoned with.\u201d",
      "\u201cCecile led with heart, fearlessness, and courage on the frontlines of the fight for women\u2019s rights and the dignity of every woman to make decisions about their own body. She fought tirelessly on behalf of all women, and today millions across the nation benefit from her work,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cShe would want us to honor her by rededicating ourselves to the fight for fundamental freedoms. Let us roll up our sleeves and make her proud.\u201d",
      "Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa remembered Richards as a \u201ctrailblazer, a force for good, and a voice for the voiceless.\u201d",

      "\u201cI have great hope that the Trump administration will sincerely engage in diligent work to bring Austin home,\u201d Debra Tice said. \u201cHis people have already reached out to me. I haven\u2019t experienced that for the last four years.\u201d",
      "Tice, now 43, was one of the first American journalists to report on the Syrian civil war that began in 2011 before his disappearance in 2012. The State Department\u00a0contended he was being held by the Syrian government. Assad\u2019s former government vehemently\u00a0denied the accusation.",

      "At the time, Tice's mother told \u201cNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt\u201d that she had received intelligence just before the Assad government\u2019s collapse that her son was alive and being well taken care of, adding that it was only a matter of time until the family would be reunited.",

      "\u201cI look forward to working closely with his new team, including national security adviser Mike Waltz and Special Presidential Envoy Adam Boehler,\u201d she said.",
      "Tice's media conference came a day after she met with Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of Syria's new government and the rebel group that toppled the regime of Bashar al-Assad last month. She expressed hope that the new authorities can help uncover more information about Austin's whereabouts.",

    "story": [
      "OTAY MESA, Calif. \u2014 It was a quiet morning as border agents patrolled the primary and secondary fences that divide San Diego and Tijuana as the nation awaited newly sworn-in President Donald Trump to sign a series of immigration-related executive orders.",
      "In his first speech as president, Trump said he \"will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.\"",
      "Trump vowed to reinstate \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d a policy from his first administration requiring anyone seeking to enter the United States through Mexico to remain in that country.",

      "\"If they reinstate it, this is something we don\u2019t agree with. We have a different focus. We want to adjust it,\" Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente, Mexico's secretary for external relations, said in a news conference Monday morning. But ultimately, \"the desire is to keep the same policies as now,\" he added.",
      "De la Fuente described the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy as an \"unilateral\" one, meaning that it \"does not require the assistance of other countries\" to put it in place.",
      "While the policy does not obligate Mexico to process U.S. asylum requests, de la Fuente said, \"we can come to some agreements and find a way to operate.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said she and her administration \"insist that there is a possibility to get asylum, not only from the border in person, but from a distance in the southern part of the country or in other countries.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s what we\u2019re working on,\" she added.",
      "Sheinbaum also insisted that the CBP One app, which allowed migrants seeking asylum to be prescreened before reaching the U.S., should be kept. According to her, \"this will help alleviate the tension in the northern border of Mexico and the southern border of the U.S.\"",
      "However, the website for the CBP One app stated Monday afternoon that it \"is no longer available, and existing appointments have been cancelled.\"",
      "With Trump vowing to begin enacting the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history, Mexican Interior Secretary Rosa Icela Rodr\u00edguez Vel\u00e1zquez said that while the Mexican government does not agree with such actions, \"we will receive them and give them access to Mexico's welfare programs.\"",
      "These would include access to health services for them and their families, transport to their home countries and access to telephone communications, according to Rodr\u00edguez Vel\u00e1zquez, as well as any other services offered by Mexico's Social Security Institute.",
      "Trump, again, reiterated his intention to sign an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America during his inaugural speech.",
      "While it's not clear if a U.S. president has the authority to rename international waters, Sheinbaum had previously clapped back at Trump by suggesting that the U.S. should be renamed \"America Mexicana.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Just hours after being sworn in as the nation's 47th president, Donald Trump was already back to rally mode.",
      "Bitterly cold temperatures forced Trump\u2019s swearing-in ceremony indoors to the Capitol rotunda, meaning his supporters couldn't congregate on the National Mall for the event. Instead, thousands packed into the Capital One Arena downtown to celebrate the man to whom many here had dedicated years trying to return to the White House.",
      "Trump entered the arena around 5:30 p.m. through the crowd, which was chanting \u201cUSA\u201d as he approached the stage where his family members were seated.",
      "It was a kickoff to the inaugural parade that was originally scheduled to be held outdoors. Heavy on law enforcement groups and marching bands, it lapped around the stage to enthusiastic support from the crowd.",
      "\"You are witnessing the dawn of the golden age of America,\u201d Trump said when taking stage after the parade.",
      "Trump opened his speech talking about the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas as part of a long-awaited ceasefire deal, and he told the crowd he would be signing pardons for some collection of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He referred to those Jan. 6 defendants as \"hostages,\" as some Israeli hostages and families stood on stage behind him.",
      "The crowd gave a loud boo when Trump mentioned that on his way out of office, President Joe Biden issued pre-emptive pardons for members of his family.",
      "After his remarks, Trump moved to a wooden desk adorned with the seal of the president of the United States to sign a handful of executive actions that he said would overturn \u201cradical\u201d Biden-era policies. Trump had long-promised sweeping executive action on day one of his administration on issues related to immigration, the economy and energy policy.",
      "Trump signed a total of nine documents on stage, showing his signature to the crowd after each. They included rescinding 78 Biden-era executive actions, freezing federal hiring, making federal workers return to work, withdrawing from the Paris climate pact, instructing federal agencies to look into lowering the cost of living and ending \"the weaponization of government\u201d against political enemies.",
      "\u201cCould you imagine Biden doing this?\" Trump said while signing the directives. \"I don\u2019t think so.\"",
      "He then threw the pens into the crowd.",
      "Lines to get into the event extended for several blocks. Some of the most die-hard Trump supporters waited overnight in single-digit temperatures to get into the packed venue, which has a capacity far smaller than that of the National Mall.",
      "The arena was opened for people to watch Trump's swearing-in speech, which was broadcast live on the jumbotron.",
      "One day earlier, Trump held a preinaugural rally at the arena, and a number of people were turned away after it filled to capacity.",
      "\u201cWe had tickets for the inauguration, and were disappointed like everyone else, and it was hard waiting in line,\u201d said Janeen Coyle, who drove eight hours from Cincinnati. \u201cBut this is a historic event. He\u2019s a nonconsecutive president, the first since Grover Cleveland, so it was important to be here.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a historic figure, whether you love him or hate him,\u201d she said.",
      "In the days leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration, Washington itself was filled with Trump supporters, as people wearing his trademark red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats could be seen in bars, restaurants and coffee shops throughout the city. Booths selling Trump merchandise popped up in the streets surrounding the Capitol, and Trump-themed music could be heard booming from MAGA-adorned vehicles that stopped on street corners for impromptu photo shoots with Trump supporters walking by.",
      "It was a different greeting in the nation\u2019s capital for Trump and his MAGA supporters than in 2017. Plenty of Washingtonians still left town ahead of the inauguration, but there's been more acceptance of Trump\u2019s win this time around.",
      "The 2017 inauguration was marked by more widespread protests after an election win that shocked and surprised much of the nation\u2019s political establishment.",
      "This time, Trump was the political establishment.",
      "\u201cThe whole city, it feels like it is really excited,\u201d said Lisa Wood, who drove with Coyle from Cincinnati for the inauguration. \u201cI was not expecting that.\u201d",
      "The mood was overwhelmingly celebratory in the arena. Still, the partisan rancor of the hard-fought 2024 campaign lingered.",
      "Loud boos rang out through the crowd when Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, the Clintons and outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris, were shown on the big screen entering the Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony.",
      "Trump\u2019s former vice president, Mike Pence, was also loudly booed when shown on screen. Pence had a swift falling out with Trump and many of his supporters after Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump and his supporters believed Pence could have blocked Joe Biden's 2020 election win.",
      "The formal inauguration ceremonies were shown on the arena\u2019s overhead jumbotron, getting loud reaction from the crowd throughout, with the loudest choruses coming when Trump finished the oath of office at 12:02 p.m. and during a speech where he outlined his sweeping Day 1 executive actions.",
      "At one point shortly after Trump was officially sworn in, an attendee who apparently expressed anti-Trump views in the audience was removed as the crowd chanted, \u201cKick her out!\u201d",
      "Some in the crowd sung the 1969 No. 1 pop hit \u201cNa Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\u201d as the person exited. The song was again sung as the big screen showed Biden exiting Trump\u2019s inauguration to board a helicopter and leave Washington.",
      "The speaker lineup featured a long list of MAGA-world luminaries familiar to anyone who had attended the dozens of Trump rallies held throughout the 2024 presidential campaign.",
      "Among those who took the stage were Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley; Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, who is considering a run for governor; Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk, who played a big role helping organize the Trump campaign's political ground game; and billionaire tech executive Elon Musk.",
      "Top Trump campaign aide Dan Scavino used his speech to recall the first Trump assassination attempt, in Butler, Pennsylvania.",
      "\"It is a moment I will never forget,\" Scavino said. \"We were in the hospital, he had blood coming down his ear, and he wanted to know how his staff was.\"",
      "\"The guy just got shot in the damn head, and he's worried about us,\" he added.",
      "The crowd responded with chants of \"fight, fight, fight,\" the word Trump himself shouted moments after being shot."

    "story": [
      "Days before the Oscar race officially kicks off, one of the expected frontrunners sparked controversy when the film's editor admitted using AI to enhance Hungarian accents in \"The Brutalist.\"",
      "Director Brady Corbet's post-World War II epic stars Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones and follows an architect who survives the war and escapes Europe to America to rebuild his life.",
      "Controversy began stirring over the weekend after editor D\u00e1vid Jancs\u00f3 shared in an interview with\u00a0tech magazine Red Shark News that AI was used to enhance the Hungarian accents of the lead actors.",
      "The debate over the use of the technology is heating up just ahead of Thursday's announcements of the Academy Award nominations, leading some to question whether \"The Brutalist\" should be considered for some of the biggest awards. The film is fresh off a host of big wins at the Golden Globes, including best picture, drama.",
      "How was AI used?",
      "Jancs\u00f3 said that the film's production utilized Ukrainian software company Respeecher to enhance Brody's and Jones' Hungarian accents when they are speaking Hungarian.",
      "The AI technology was not used to enhance the English language dialogue, which is used in most of the film, the filmmakers said.",
      "\"I am a native Hungarian speaker and I know that it is one of the most difficult languages to learn to pronounce,\" Jancs\u00f3 told Red Shark News. \"It's an extremely unique language. We coached [Brody and Jones] and they did a fabulous job but we also wanted to perfect it so that not even locals will spot any difference.\"",
      "Certain sounds and letters in Hungarian are hard to speak, according to Jancs\u00f3. He said the filmmakers first tried to \"ADR these harder elements with the actors.\"",
      "(ADR, or Automated Dialogue Replacement, is a post-production process used to re-record dialogue.)",
      "When that didn't work, Jancs\u00f3 said the team \"tried to ADR them completely with other actors but that just didn't work.\"",
      "\"So we looked for other options of how to enhance it,\" Jancs\u00f3 told Red Shark News.",
      "Brody and Jones recorded their voices with the AI software, as did Jancs\u00f3, who said \"Most of their Hungarian dialogue has a part of me talking in there.\"",
      "\"We were very careful about keeping their performances. It's mainly just replacing letters here and there,\" Jancs\u00f3 said.",
      "The editor said AI was also used at the end of the film to create \"a series of architectural drawings and finished buildings in the style of\" Brody's character.",
      "\"It is controversial in the industry to talk about AI, but it shouldn't be,\" Jancs\u00f3 said. \"There's nothing in the film using AI that hasn't been done before. It just makes the process a lot faster.\"",
      "What has the film's director said?",
      "In response to the online discussion over the AI usage in the film, Corbet, who nabbed a Golden Globe for best director for \"The Brutalist,\" said his lead actors' performances are \"completely their own\" and that they worked \"for months\" with a dialect coach to perfect their Hungarian accents.",
      "\"Innovative Respeecher technology was used in Hungarian language dialogue editing only, specifically to refine certain vowels and letters for accuracy. No English language was changed. This was a manual process, done by our sound team and Respeecher in post-production,\" Corbet said in a statement. \"The aim was to preserve the authenticity of Adrien and Felicity's performances in another language, not to replace or alter them and done with the utmost respect for the craft.\"",
      "Corbet said that AI was not used to create or render any of the buildings seen in the film, and that all images seen are hand-drawn.",
      "\"To clarify, in the memorial video featured in the background of a shot, our editorial team created pictures intentionally designed to look like poor digital renderings circa 1980,\" Corbet added.",
      "\"The Brutalist is a film about human complexity, and every aspect of its creation was driven by human effort, creativity, and collaboration. We are incredibly proud of our team and what they've accomplished here,\" Corbet said.",
      "Brody and Jones did not respond to requests for comment Monday.",
      "When asked if Jancs\u00f3 had further comment, representatives for the movie pointed to Corbet's statement.",
      "AI in Hollywood",
      "\"The Brutalist\" isn't the only Oscar frontrunner to employ AI.",
      "\"Emilia Perez,\" a musical about a Mexican cartel boss who transitions into a woman that also won big at the Golden Globes, also used Respeecher, the software company said in a post on Facebook.",
      "It wasn't clear from the Facebook post exactly how Respeecher was used in \"Emilia Perez.\"",
      "The use of AI in Hollywood films isn't completely new, but the technology has caused a sense of whiplash in the wake of the dual 2023 writers and actors strikes. AI was a sticking point during negotiations between the respective unions and studios, with creatives seeking assurances that their work would not be replaced by the technology. As Hollywood continues to try and return to normalcy following the strikes that went on for months, many remain concerned that the industry has not, and may not fully rebound.",
      "Last year, two AI-related deals made by two Hollywood companies also drew scrutiny from people online who expressed concern about the repercussions.",
      "In September,\u00a0the studio\u00a0Lionsgate,\u00a0behind franchises such as the \"Hunger Games,\"\u00a0said it would allow filmmakers to \"augment\" their work with AI in an effort to save money,\u00a0Variety reported at the time,\u00a0prompting online disappointment from people who questioned what this would mean for filmmakers.",
      "In October, Blumhouse Productions\u00a0garnered backlash online after it announced it had partnered with Meta to make short films using the company\u2019s AI tools.",
      "Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum defended the move, saying his company \"enables artists\" and that \"artists always come first.\"",
      "\"Artists want tools. And to me, it would be irresponsible if we didn't at least know about the tools, and I think, also for me, it would be irresponsible to not learn about the tools,\" said in a statement.",
      "Blum added: \"I know nothing about AI, but I wanted to do this to learn about it.\" He said he wanted to enlist this partnership so when filmmakers come to him in the future to ask about using AI, he can at least have a \"reasonable answer.\"",
      "\"It's here to stay. So I want to understand it and I don't understand it yet,\" Blum said."

      "Fans of the Oscar-nominated thriller may remember that throughout \u201cFatal Attraction,\u201d Close's character becomes increasingly agitated over being spurned by Gallagher, leading to a climactic ending in which she breaks into the couple's home, boils the family pet rabbit in a pot, then attempts to kill her former lover with a butcher knife.",
      "In the end, Gallagher and Forrest battle it out in the bathroom before Forrest is ultimately shot to death by his wife, Beth (played by Anne Archer).",
      "However, according to Close, that ending was much different than was was in the script with Forrest, an ardent fan of \u201cMadame Butterfly,\u201d emulating the opera's tragic ending the film's original finale.",
      "\u201cIn the original ending (Forrest and Gallagher) have that terrible fight and then she takes that same knife and as \u2018Madam Butterfly\u2019 is playing, she cuts her throat and she dies,\u201d Close told Barrymore, who audibly gasped out loud.",
      "\u201cDid they shoot that scene?\u201d asked Barrymore. \u201cThey did shoot that scene,\u201d Close replied.",
      "But according to Close, that alternate ending never made it to theaters because test audiences hated it. Specifically, they hated Close's character.",
      "\u201cThe audience hated (Forrest) so much for coming between that perfect little family, even though (Gallagher) cheated on his beautiful wife, that they felt she needed to be punished even more, so they came back and told me that they're going to re-shoot it,\u201d said Close.",
      "The decision surprised Close, who says she did research and interviews ahead of the role, determining that she \u201cwould have done herself in before she would have killed, she was not a psychopath,\u201d explained Close.",
      "In fact, upon learning of the film's new ending, Close says she refused to do it, but changed her mind after a meeting with the film's director, Adrian Lyne, producers and Michael Douglas.",
      "\u201cI was saying, \u2018What if it was you? What if it was your character? What did you do?\u2019 Like, I was so furious,\u201d she said.",
      "The decision to re-shoot led to an Oscar-nomination for Close, as well as five others for the film in 1988, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress for Archer and a Best Director nod for Lyne."

      "However, things changed after Lamar took shots at Drake and other rappers during his guest verses on Big Sean\u2019s song \u201cControl\u201d in August 2013. He appeared to ridicule Drake again in his lyrics during a performance at the BET Hip-Hop Awards in October 2013.",
      "Between 2014 and 2020 the two artists released several diss tracks about each other but the vitriol between the rappers seemed to die down shortly after that.",

      "The diss tracks continued at a breakneck pace until it eventually died down in the summer of 2024.",
      "How successful has \u2018Not Like Us\u2019 been?",

    "summary": "Justin Baldoni filed a $400 million lawsuit against \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, on Jan. 16. Here's a look at some of the allegations.",
    "story": [
      "\"It Ends With Us\" director and actor Justin Baldoni filed a lawsuit on Thursday against his co-star Blake Lively, adding another layer to the legal saga between the pair that began in December.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, an \"It Ends With Us\" LLC, producer Jamey Heath and PR pros Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel filed a 179-page complaint in a U.S. district court in New York on Jan. 16, accusing Lively; her husband, Ryan Reynolds; her PR person Leslie Sloane; and Sloane's business of defamation and other contractual claims.",
      "\"Heartbreakingly, a film that Baldoni envisioned years ago would honor the survivors of domestic violence by telling their story, with the lofty goal of making a positive impact in the world, has now been overshadowed beyond recognition solely as a result of Lively\u2019s actions and cruelty,\" attorneys for Baldoni write in the complaint.",
      "Lively's legal team responded to the filing, calling the lawsuit \"another chapter in the abuser playbook\" in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\"This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim,\" the statement continued.",
      "Lively's legal team said Baldoni and Wayfarer \"are trying to shift the narrative to Ms. Lively by falsely claiming that she seized creative control and alienated the cast from Mr. Baldoni. The evidence will show that the cast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer. The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony\u2019s cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\"",
      "The statement concluded by saying \"the strategy of attacking the woman is desperate, it does not refute the evidence in Ms. Lively\u2019s complaint, and it will fail.\"",
      "Lively previously filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni in California and a lawsuit against him in New York. Baldoni has denied Lively's allegations against him.",
      "Baldoni is seeking damages of at least $400 million for defamation, civil extortion, false light invasion of privacy, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional interference with contractual relations, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage\u00a0and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, said in a statement to TODAY.com that the lawsuit was \"a legal action based on an overwhelming amount of untampered evidence detailing Blake Lively and her team\u2019s duplicitous attempt to destroy Justin Baldoni, his team and their respective companies by disseminating grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret. Blake Lively was either severely misled by her team or intentionally and knowingly misrepresented the truth,\" he said.",
      "\"Ms. Lively will never again be allowed to continue to exploit actual victims of real harassment solely for her personal reputation gain at the expense of those without power,\" he continued. \"Let\u2019s not forget, Ms. Lively and her team attempted to bulldoze reputations and livelihoods for heinously selfish reasons through their own dangerous manipulation of the media before even taking any actual legal action. We know the truth, and now the public does too. Justin and his team have nothing to hide, documents do not lie.\"",
      "Here\u2019s what Baldoni accuses Lively of in the complaint related to allegations of \u201cbreach of contract, extortion, defamation and further wrongdoing.\u201d",
      "Baldoni says Lively insisted on oversight of her character\u2019s costume",
      "Lively, who was hired as an actor to play Lily Bloom in the film, allegedly insisted on control over her character's costume before filming even began, according to the complaint.",
      "Baldoni alleges that Lively's actions led the costume designer to re-shop her wardrobe, \"far exceeding the allocated budget and diverting time and resources, while also preparing wardrobes for the rest of the cast,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Lively spoke about her involvement with the costumes during the press tour for the film, including with TODAY's Sheinelle Jones.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s storytelling,\u201d she said on TODAY. \u201cTo me, fashion and costume design is storytelling.\u201d",
      "Lively wrote a draft of the rooftop scene, then said Reynolds wrote it at the film's premiere, lawsuit says",
      "During production, Lively asked Baldoni if she could \"take a pass\" at writing one of the scenes in the film, where Lily and Baldoni's character, Ryle, meet on the rooftop of his apartment building, the complaint states.",
      "Baldoni alleges the draft of the scene Lively wrote significantly differed from the original version, and that he thanked her for her passion and said that the final scene would likely end up being somewhere between her version and the original version.",
      "Lively did not respond and went silent for multiple days afterward, according to the complaint.",
      "In text messages, Lively referred to a meeting she called at her penthouse, in which Reynolds greeted Baldoni and gave his wife praise for her version of the scene, the complaint says.",
      "\"Hours later, as the meeting was ending, a famous, and famously close, friend of Reynolds and Lively, walked into the room and similarly began praising Lively\u2019s script,\" the complaint says. \"Baldoni understood the subtext: he needed to comply with Lively\u2019s direction for the script.\"",
      "In one of the messages, Baldoni refers to the friend as \"Taylor,\" but the name is redacted in other messages. (Baldoni's team confirmed this was a reference to Taylor Swift; the pop star has not commented.)",
      "Lively\u2019s complaint did not have details on this specific alleged meeting.",
      "Later, during a red carpet interview, Lively said her husband had written the scene, according to the complaint.",
      "\"This was also the first time that Plaintiffs learned that Reynolds \u2014 who had no formal role whatsoever in the Film\u2019s production \u2014 had made unauthorized changes to the script in secret,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "Baldoni explains why he asked for Lively's weight",
      "Lively introduced Baldoni to the person who would become his personal trainer, according to the complaint.",
      "During production, Baldoni privately reached out to the trainer to ask what Lively's weight was so that he could properly prepare his back muscles for a scene in which he had to lift her up, according to the complaint. (Baldoni has suffered from lifelong back injuries, according to the complaint.)",
      "The next day, Lively asked Baldoni to come to her penthouse, where he was greeted by Reynolds, who swore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cHow dare you f------- ask about my wife\u2019s weight?\" Reynolds asked Baldoni, according to the complaint. \"What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d",
      "Baldoni offered what are described in the lawsuit as \u201crepeated (and completely unwarranted)\u201d apologies, and Reynolds demanded that the scene be removed entirely, according to his complaint. Lively allegedly refused to perform the scene, even after it was rehearsed with a stunt double, according to the complaint.",
      "In Lively\u2019s original complaint, she alleges that weeks after she gave birth to her fourth child, Baldoni \u201csecretly called her fitness trainer without her knowledge or permission and implied that he wanted her to lose weight in two weeks\u201d because he was concerned about picking her up in a scene. She said in her complaint that \"there was no such scene.\"",
      "Later, according to Baldoni's complaint, Lively delivered an ultimatum: \"If Baldoni could not get on board with her work methods, he had two weeks to recast her.\"",
      "Baldoni's attorneys say a 17-point document brought by Lively was 'essentially signed under duress'",
      "After filming was paused due to multiple strikes, production was set to begin again once the SAG-AFTRA strike ended, according to the complaint.",
      "\"The same day that the SAG-AFTRA strike ended, Baldoni, the studios, and producers were eager to resume production. Instead, they were met with an email from Lively\u2019s lawyer, who sent Wayfarer an unsettling and unexpected 17-point list of non-negotiable conditions that must be met before Lively would return to work,\" the complaint states.",
      "\"The stunning list was drafted for the apparent purpose of insinuating or outright claiming that Baldoni, Heath, and others had engaged in sexually inappropriate conduct during filming,\" the complaint continues.",
      "In Lively\u2019s complaint, she also includes details on the meeting, saying it was to discuss \u201cthe inappropriate conduct that Ms. Lively, her employees and other cast and crew experienced at the hands of Mr. Baldoni and Mr. Heath.\u201d Her complaint included the list\u00a0she says was reviewed at the meeting.",
      "In the list, Lively suggested that there wasn't an intimacy coordinator on set, but attorneys for Baldoni write that there was one assigned to the film.",
      "The complaint alleges that Lively didn't meet with the intimacy coordinator, leading Baldoni to work on scenes with the coordinator and relay any changes to Lively.",
      "Baldoni accuses Lively of unchoreographed kissing during scenes, while one of the 17 points on Lively's list was \"no spontaneous improvisation\" during intimate scenes.",
      "Before returning to production, Lively allegedly had more notes and script changes that Baldoni eventually mostly agreed to, out of fear the film would be taken from him by \"threats and coercion,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni write that the document was \u201cessentially signed under duress,\u201d and in an email to his team, Baldoni wrote that he was \u201cwaiving the white flag and submitting\u201d and that he would give Lively \u201c98% of what she wants.\u201d",
      "Baldoni says Lively refused to promote the film if she didn\u2019t get her own cuts, replaced film editors with her own",
      "In April and May 2024, Lively was granted her own cut of the film after Sony told Wayfarer that Lively would refuse to promote the film unless her demands were met, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cUltimately, Lively replaced the Film\u2019s editors with her own choice: an editor often used by Reynolds, and the Film\u2019s editors had to be let go,\u201d the complaint states.",
      "As there were two versions of the film, Lively's cut and Baldoni's cut, the studio agreed to do an official audience test of both versions, according to the complaint. Baldoni's version \"scored significantly higher with key audience demographics,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Lively then said Hoover would not promote the film unless her version was released, and Sony later told Wayfarer that neither Lively nor any of the film's cast would promote the film unless her cut was used.",
      "As noted previously, Lively specified in her response to Baldoni\u2019s lawsuit that \u201cSony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony\u2019s cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\u201d",
      "\"Baldoni was forced to choose between killing the film and his own career by insisting on his own creative vision and rights, or putting out a version of the Film that Baldoni knew could still be so important to domestic violence survivors, even if it differed greatly from what it could have been,\" the complaint states. \"Baldoni reluctantly chose the latter, and stood down, allowing Lively\u2019s version of the Film to be released and promoted.\"",
      "The film went on to bring in over $148 million at the box office throughout its theatrical run.",
      "Baldoni alleges he was kept apart from Lively at the film's premiere",
      "The lawsuit contends that Lively communicated that she would not promote the movie if she was not given a producer credit.",
      "Baldoni and Wayfarer also allege they sent a letter to the Producers Guild of America \"under duress\" asking for Lively to be given a \"coveted\" p.g.a. designation on her producer's credit even though they didn't believe she deserved it.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni write in the lawsuit that he was in Sweden for his wife's birthday when he was informed that Lively and a \"majority of the cast\" would boycott the \"It Ends with Us\" premiere if Baldoni attended it.",
      "A compromise was reached in which \"Wayfarer persuaded Lively to 'permit' Baldoni and the Wayfarer team, along with their friends and family, to attend\" the premiere, according to court documents. Baldoni and his family and friends then attended under \"demeaning and humiliating conditions,\" per the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Baldoni had to cut his time on the red carpet short at the event and was \"instructed to stop immediately\" because Lively was on her way.",
      "The court documents include photos of Baldoni with friends and family on folding chairs and surrounded by pallets of soda bottles. Baldoni's attorneys say the photos are from the basement of the venue, where Baldoni and his entourage were allegedly moved to be separate from the remainder of the cast at the premiere.",
      "The group was then escorted out of the building by security to \"avoid even a chance of interaction with Lively or her guests,\" his complaint says.",
      "Baldoni and Wayfarer also allege that they had to organize and pay for a separate after-party for \"himself and the Wayfarer team\" because he was excluded from the official after-party attended by Lively and the cast. He alleges Wayfarer paid for both parties.",
      "Baldoni's attorneys also allege that he was not invited to any events involving cast members, such as photo shoots, screenings and promotional events, according to court documents.",
      "Baldoni alleges the cast was 'induced' by Lively to shun him, unfollow him on social media",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Lively \"induced\" other cast members to avoid Baldoni \"in an early attempt to give fans the impression that Baldoni had committed an egregious sin, something so egregious that no one wanted to even take photos with him or have him around.\u201d Lively\u2019s response to his lawsuit says that \u201ccast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer.\u201d",
      "His attorneys also write that Lively told Sony that she and the cast would not take part in any promotion of the film with Baldoni present, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit also alleges she ordered him to be removed from all artwork promoting the film, including the posters.",
      "Baldoni's attorneys allege that Lively used tactics like unfollowing him on social media as \"crumbs,\" to give fans \"just enough to allow them to come to their own conclusions\" about him, according to court documents.",
      "The court documents include alleged screenshots of a friendly and complimentary text message exchange between Baldoni and actor Isabela Ferrer, who plays a younger version of Lively's character in the movie. The lawsuit asserts that Lively then turned Ferrer against him.",
      "\u201cIt was not until Ferrer spent substantial time with Lively during film promotions that Ferrer felt compelled to shun Baldoni in repudiation of her warm words,\" the lawsuit reads.",
      "Ryan Reynolds allegedly told an executive at Baldoni's agency to 'drop' him",

      "It has been a point of pride for him, and it is true. In the first year of Trump\u2019s first term,\u00a0U.S. forces, working with Syrian Kurdish allies,\u00a0defeated\u00a0the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d and liberated\u00a0its capital. But the fall of the Assad regime has left Syria at risk of coming apart under pressure from a variety of terrorist groups, local militias and Israeli airstrikes. And Syria\u2019s interim leaders, while proclaiming moderate intentions, have roots\u00a0in Al Qaeda and\u00a0another terrorist group, Hayat al Sham (HTS). The\u00a0nightmare scenario for many experts is that\u00a0ISIS could re-establish its stronghold in the fledgling state and export more terrorism to the West or inspire it, as it did the New Year\u2019s Day attack in New Orleans.",
      "The situation means that, once he is in office,\u00a0Trump will\u00a0most likely\u00a0have to make some hard choices \u2014\u00a0insist on withdrawing all or some of the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, in line with his previous positions,\u00a0or leave them in place to prevent an ISIS resurgence and a tarnishing of what he sees as his accomplishment in his first term. U.S. withdrawal\u00a0could easily re-create Syria as a base of operations for terrorist attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Israel, the United States and Europe.",

Mazloum\u00a0Abdi,\u00a0told The Guardian this\u00a0month\u00a0that ISIS is growing in strength after it seized weapons from the collapsed\u00a0Syrian\u00a0regime. He\u00a0also\u00a0said the Kurdish forces are coming under increased pressure from\u00a0Turkish\u00a0President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who views them, along with\u00a0Kurdish separatists based in Syria\u00a0known as the PKK,\u00a0as threats\u00a0to his regime.",

Bush,\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0recently\u00a0that even if Trump were to continue bombing campaigns and targeted operations against the terrorist group, removing U.S. troops would leave the Kurdish coalition vulnerable and ultimately lead to an expanded footprint for ISIS.",
      "\u201cWith those troops out of there, we\u2019re putting a lot of U.S. interests at risk,\u201d\u00a0Kattouf\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t see\u00a0[HTS]\u00a0or other allied rebel forces able to take on that issue right now.\u201d",
      "The fear among Biden administration counterterrorism officials\u00a0is that\u00a0a Trump withdrawal of U.S. forces would leave the Syrian Kurds guarding the ISIS prisoners vulnerable to attacks from other factions \u2014 or the looming presence of Turkey, just across the border.\u00a0Both\u00a0Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden\u00a0have worked hard to restrain Erdo\u011fan,\u00a0whose country remains\u00a0a NATO ally, from attacking America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Trump said\u00a0at his news conference last week that\u00a0he had asked Erdo\u011fan\u00a0not to\u00a0go\u00a0after \u201ccertain people,\u201d clearly referring to the Kurds. Trump added, \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan\u00a0is his friend of mine, he\u2019s a guy I like, respect. I think he respects me also.\u201d",
      "Beyond serving as a base for operations and planning, any Syrian territory that falls to ISIS could help it project an image of power and resistance and inspire others around the world. The group has already been\u00a0expanding its global\u00a0reach through social media, sponsoring attacks and\u00a0influencing followers worldwide, including so-called lone wolves,\u00a0through what anti-terrorism experts say is a surge of sophisticated online propaganda. CIA Director William Burns\u00a0told NPR\u00a0last\u00a0week\u00a0that\u00a0the agency is \u201cquite concerned\u201d about the rising threat posed by ISIS, particularly its \u201cability to inspire people.\u201d\u00a0And in July, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned the House Judiciary Committee that \u201cthe greatest terrorism threat to our homeland has been posed by lone actors or small cells of individuals who typically radicalize to violence online and use easily accessible weapons to attack soft targets.\u201d",
      "The U.S. intelligence community\u00a0and the FBI have been sounding those alarm bells for more than a year.\u00a0A senior administration official\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0on Friday, \u201cThere is a heightened focus on ISIS,\u201d pointing to the cancellation of three Taylor Swift Eras Tour shows in Vienna in August after warnings from U.S. intelligence of ISIS terrorist plots targeting the venues. And in March, gunmen from ISIS-K, an affiliate of ISIS based in Afghanistan, killed more than 130 people at the Crocus City Hall, a well-known concert venue outside Moscow, despite warnings from U.S. intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",
      "\u201cSyria could provide the group with the momentum that it\u2019s long sought to kind of spill back onto the headlines, whether that\u2019s ISIS K in Afghanistan, ISIS core, ISIS Central and Syria and parts of Iraq, and again, the homegrown violent extremists that live in the West that ISIS is attempting to push over the edge conduct the types of attack that we saw in New Orleans,\u201d counterterrorism\u00a0expert\u00a0Collin Clarke\u00a0of the Soufan Group\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0after the New Orleans attack.",
      "Clearly alarmed by the possibility of the collapsed state\u2019s exporting terrorism to Europe,\u00a0two weeks ago\u00a0the foreign ministers of France and Germany, representing the European Union, traveled to Damascus to meet Syria\u2019s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa,\u00a0who was\u00a0known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, before he disavowed his connections with\u00a0HTS.",
      "American boots?",
      "\u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend,\u201d Trump said on X in the hours before the collapse of the Assad regime, adding, \u201cThe United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser,\u00a0Rep. Mike Waltz,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0echoed Trump\u2019s reluctance for the United States to intervene in Syria but underscored the incoming administration\u2019s commitment to combating ISIS. \u201cWe do not need American boots running around Syria in any way, shape or form, but we\u2019re keeping an eye on those things, ISIS, Israel\u2019s border, and kind of the broader dynamic with our Gulf allies,\u201d Waltz said on a podcast late last month.",
      "But experts question the ability to continue the fight against ISIS in Syria without a U.S.\u00a0military\u00a0presence.",
      "During the transition, a senior Biden administration official said, the current administration has been briefing Trump\u2019s national security team on the need for a continued U.S. military presence to prevent Russia, Turkey or Iran from gaining dominance. The outgoing Biden administration has itself been treading carefully, sending its top Middle East diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Barbara\u00a0Leaf, to Damascus only after European counterparts had already visited and only after\u00a0public pressure\u00a0from the mother of Austin Tice, the American journalist believed to be imprisoned in Syria,\u00a0who said\u00a0the United States should be more engaged.\u00a0To even meet with the new interim leader, the State Department first\u00a0had to lift\u00a0the\u00a0$10\u00a0million bounty\u00a0it\u00a0had\u00a0put\u00a0on\u00a0his\u00a0head\u00a0when he led\u00a0HTS.",
      "But now the critical question of whether the United States should play a role in preventing Syria from again harboring terrorists or permitting power plays from U.S. regional adversaries will be on Trump\u2019s doorstep as he arrives at the White House. That and the challenge of combating the online propaganda that spreads ISIS\u2019 terrorist philosophy far and wide."

    "story": [
      "OTAY MESA, Calif. \u2014 It was a quiet morning as border agents patrolled the primary and secondary fences that divide San Diego and Tijuana as the nation awaited newly sworn-in President Donald Trump to sign a series of immigration-related executive orders.",
      "In his first speech as president, Trump said he \"will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.\"",
      "Trump vowed to reinstate \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d a policy from his first administration requiring anyone seeking to enter the United States through Mexico to remain in that country.",
      "He also promised to \"send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\"",
      "With agents still awaiting new guidance, it was not immediately clear how exactly the executive orders will affect operations on the ground.",
      "But ahead of Trump's inauguration, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and members of her Cabinet expressed their disagreement with his plan to revive the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy and the \"unilateral deportations\" of Mexican nationals living in the U.S.",
      "\"If they reinstate it, this is something we don\u2019t agree with. We have a different focus. We want to adjust it,\" Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente, Mexico's secretary for external relations, said in a news conference Monday morning. But ultimately, \"the desire is to keep the same policies as now,\" he added.",
      "De la Fuente described the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy as an \"unilateral\" one, meaning that it \"does not require the assistance of other countries\" to put it in place.",
      "While the policy does not obligate Mexico to process U.S. asylum requests, de la Fuente said, \"we can come to some agreements and find a way to operate.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said she and her administration \"insist that there is a possibility to get asylum, not only from the border in person, but from a distance in the southern part of the country or in other countries.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s what we\u2019re working on,\" she added.",
      "Sheinbaum also insisted that the CBP One app, which allowed migrants seeking asylum to be prescreened before reaching the U.S., should be kept. According to her, \"this will help alleviate the tension in the northern border of Mexico and the southern border of the U.S.\"",
      "However, the website for the CBP One app stated Monday afternoon that it \"is no longer available, and existing appointments have been cancelled.\"",
      "With Trump vowing to begin enacting the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history, Mexican Interior Secretary Rosa Icela Rodr\u00edguez Vel\u00e1zquez said that while the Mexican government does not agree with such actions, \"we will receive them and give them access to Mexico's welfare programs.\"",
      "These would include access to health services for them and their families, transport to their home countries and access to telephone communications, according to Rodr\u00edguez Vel\u00e1zquez, as well as any other services offered by Mexico's Social Security Institute.",
      "Trump, again, reiterated his intention to sign an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America during his inaugural speech.",
      "While it's not clear if a U.S. president has the authority to rename international waters, Sheinbaum had previously clapped back at Trump by suggesting that the U.S. should be renamed \"America Mexicana.\"",

      "Rudakubana also pleaded guilty to 10 charges of attempted murder relating to the attack, as well as to producing the deadly poison ricin and the possession of an Al Qaeda training manual.",
      "Judge Julian Goose said he would sentence Rudakubana on Thursday and that a life jail term was inevitable. Goose noted that the victims\u2019 families were not present to see Rudakubana plead guilty as the prosecution opening was not expected until Tuesday.",
      "Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time of the incident, initially refused to speak when asked to confirm his name, as he had at all previous hearings which meant that not guilty pleas had been entered on his behalf in December.",
      "But, after consulting with his lawyer, he confirmed he wished to change those pleas.",
      "British-born Rudakubana was arrested shortly after the attack in the quiet seaside town north of the city of Liverpool.",
      "Despite the discovery of the Al Qaeda manual, police have said the incident was not being treated as terrorism-related.",
      "In the wake of the murders, large disturbances broke out in Southport after false reports spread on social media that the suspected killer was a radical Islamist migrant.",
      "Those disturbances spread across Britain with attacks on mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer blaming the riots on far-right thuggery. More than 1,500 people were arrested."

      "Sven Smit, a senior partner at strategic WEF partner\u00a0McKinsey\u00a0& Company, said in online comments that it would be a priority for participants to \u201cunderstand what is on the mind of the leaders who are at Davos.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t fully predict it, there are themes out there that people suggest, they range from growth to sustainability, but what distils as a Davos theme is not fully predictable and that\u2019s the interesting part,\u201d Smit said.",
      "However, many of the Western institutions in attendance have, in recent years, found themselves on the wrong side of a push against globalization by populist leaders like Trump, and countries like Russia and China.",
      "WEF, too, has fallen foul of this anti-establishment trend, Scholte noted, and while the presence of leaders like Trump might not have been sought out in the past, there is now an acceptance that the world has changed.",

      "\u201cThere are various indicators that a site like the World Economic Forum isn\u2019t as strong a magnet as it might have been a couple of decades ago,\u201d Scholte said. \u201cBut the idea that it\u2019s no longer a magnet, and the idea that it also doesn\u2019t have certain areas within world economic governance where it can still be very strong, I think that would be wrong.\u201d"

      "Instead, he brought to the negotiating table decades of experience clinching some of New York\u2019s biggest real estate deals, as well as opening up about his very personal loss during the arduous talks.",
      "Born in the Bronx, the billionaire real estate developer could hardly have a more different profile from those of the American diplomats who usually craft complicated international agreements. Witkoff, 67, was raised in Long Island and trained as a real estate lawyer before charting a path in the rough-and-tumble world of New York real estate development.",
      "He has known Trump for decades, is a Republican donor and served on one of Trump\u2019s Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani made a clear reference to Witkoff, who is Jewish and has done business throughout the Middle East, during a Wednesday press conference confirming that a Hamas-Israel ceasefire deal had been reached.",
      "\u201cWhat we have seen from the U.S. in the past few days, seeing a collaboration transcending both administrations, was a clear demonstration for the commitment of the U.S. to reach to that deal,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed, a key mediator in the talks, told the crowd of reporters and dignitaries, which included Witkoff himself. \u201cAnd I really would like to thank both the envoys who are here with us in the last couple of days, and they played a vital role in reaching to this moment.\u201d",
      "A senior administration official close to the negotiations also told NBC News that Witkoff had been \u201cvery helpful, in particular ironing out a couple of issues\u201d on the \u201cvery complex deal.\u201d They added that he had been \u201cworking seamlessly\u201d on the effort with Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa.",
      "\u201cI have to say, Brett McGurk has been very fortunate to have been joined in these last 96 hours by Steve Witkoff\u201d in what \u201chas really been a historic and crucial partnership between the two of them to help nail down some of the final arrangements,\u201d the official said.",
      "Witkoff brought \u201ca new energy and a new dynamic\u201d to the table, a person familiar with the negotiations said in a separate interview before the deal was announced. \u201cHe\u2019s very much engaged and his heart is in the right place.\u201d",
      "A Middle Eastern diplomat who spoke with NBC News on condition of anonymity said Witkoff, as well as being a tough negotiator, talked about his son Andrew, who died of an OxyContin overdose in 2011 at age 22, telling \u201cofficials he empathizes with parents who have lost children on both sides.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol was formally arrested early on Sunday, days after being apprehended at his presidential compound in Seoul.",
      "Yoon\u2019s arrest could mark the beginning of an extended period in custody, lasting months or more. He faces possible imprisonment over his ill-fated declaration of martial law last month.",
      "The decision to arrest Yoon triggered unrest at the Seoul Western District Court, where dozens of his supporters broke in and rioted, destroying the main door and windows. They used plastic chairs, metal beams and police shields that they managed to wrestle away from officers. Some were seen throwing objects and using fire extinguishers, destroying furniture and glass doors. They shouted demands to see the judge who had issued the warrant, but she had already left.",
      "Hundreds of police officers were deployed and nearly 90 protesters were arrested. Some injured police officers were seen being treated at ambulance vans. The court said it was trying to confirm whether any staff members were injured and assess the damage to its facilities.",
      "A court deliberated for 8 hours",
      "Following eight hours of deliberation, the court granted law enforcement\u2019s request for an arrest warrant for Yoon, saying he was a threat to destroy evidence. Yoon and his lawyers on Saturday appeared before the court and argued for his release.",
      "Yoon, who has been in detention since he was apprehended Wednesday in a massive law enforcement operation at his residential compound, faces potential rebellion charges linked to his declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, which set off the country\u2019s most serious political crisis since its democratization in the late 1980s.",
      "While South Korean presidents have wide-ranging immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and the military, can now extend Yoon\u2019s detention to 20 days, during which they will transfer the case to public prosecutors for indictment.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers could also file a petition to challenge the court\u2019s arrest warrant.",
      "Yoon\u2019s appearance in court triggered chaotic scenes in nearby streets, where thousands of his fervent supporters rallied for hours calling for his release. Even before the court issued the warrant for Yoon\u2019s arrest, protesters repeatedly clashed with police who detained dozens of them, including about 20 who climbed over a fence in an attempt to approach the court. At least two vehicles carrying anti-corruption investigators were damaged as they left the court after arguing for Yoon\u2019s arrest.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers said he spoke for about 40 minutes to the judge during the nearly five-hour closed-door hearing Saturday. His legal team and anti-corruption agencies presented opposing arguments about whether he should be held in custody.",
      "Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested and indicted for their roles in the enforcement of martial law.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyer decries his arrest",
      "The crisis began when Yoon, in an attempt to break through legislative gridlock, imposed military rule and sent troops to the National Assembly and election offices. The standoff lasted only hours after lawmakers who managed to get through a blockade voted to lift the measure. The opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14.",
      "His political fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which is deliberating whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "Seok Dong-hyeon, one of Yoon\u2019s lawyers, called the court\u2019s decision to issue the warrant \u201cthe epitome of anti-constitutionalism and anti-rule of law,\u201d maintaining Yoon\u2019s claim that his martial law decree was a legitimate act of governance. He pointed to the chaos at the Seoul Western Court and said Yoon\u2019s arrest would inspire more anger from his supporters.",
      "Yoon\u2019s People Power Party regretted his arrest but also pleaded for his supporters to refrain from further violence.",
      "The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which drove the legislative effort to impeach Yoon on Dec. 14, said his arrest would be a \u201ccornerstone for restoring the collapsed constitutional order.\u201d Kim Sung-hoi, a party lawmaker and spokesperson, called for stern punishment of Yoon\u2019s supporters who stormed the court.",
      "\u201cI urge police to firmly enforce the law so that forces supporting rebellion will never even think of causing turmoil again,\u201d he said.",
      "The country\u2019s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, expressed \u201cstrong regret\u201d about the violence at the court, saying it \u201cdirectly undermines democracy and the rule of law.\u201d He asked for heightened security at the sites related to Yoon\u2019s case and measures to ensure order during protests.",
      "Yoon was transported to the court from a detention center in Uiwang, near Seoul, in a blue Justice Ministry van escorted by police and the presidential security service, to attend the hearing at the court ahead of its warrant decision.",
      "The motorcade entered the court\u2019s basement parking space as thousands of Yoon\u2019s supporters gathered in nearby streets amid a heavy police presence. Following the hearing, Yoon was transported back to the detention center, where he awaited the decision. He did not speak to reporters.",
      "After its investigators were attacked by protesters later on Saturday, the anti-corruption agency asked media companies to obscure the faces of its members attending the hearing.",
      "Yoon insists his martial law decree was legitimate",
      "Yoon and his lawyers have claimed that the martial law declaration was intended as a temporary and \u201cpeaceful\u201d warning to the liberal opposition, which he accuses of obstructing his agenda with its legislative majority. Yoon says the troops sent to the National Election Commission offices were to investigate election fraud allegations, which remains unsubstantiated in South Korea.",
      "Yoon has stressed he had no intention of stopping the functioning of the legislature. He stated that the troops were sent there to maintain order, not prevent lawmakers from entering and voting to lift martial law. He denied allegations that he ordered the arrests of key politicians and election officials.",
      "Military commanders, however, have described a deliberate attempt to seize the legislature that was thwarted by hundreds of civilians and legislative staff who helped lawmakers enter the assembly, and by the troops\u2019 reluctance or refusal to follow Yoon\u2019s orders.",
      "If prosecutors indict Yoon on rebellion and abuse of power charges, which are the allegations now being examined by investigators, they could keep him in custody for up to six months before trial.",
      "If the first court convicts him and issues a prison term, Yoon would serve that sentence as the case possibly moves up to the Seoul High Court and Supreme Court. Under South Korean law, orchestrating a rebellion is punishable by life imprisonment or the death penalty."

      "No group immediately claimed responsibility for the shootings of the judges, clerics Mohammad Mogheiseh and Ali Razini. However, Razini\u2019s involvement in the 1988 executions had likely made him a target in the past, including an assassination attempt in 1999.",
      "Their killings, a rare attack targeting the judiciary, also come as Iran faces economic turmoil,\u00a0the mauling of its Mideast allies\u00a0by Israel and the return of Donald Trump to the White House on Monday.",
      "Both clerics served on Iran\u2019s Supreme Court, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. A bodyguard for one of the judges also was wounded in the attack at the Palace of Justice in Tehran, which also serves as the headquarters of the country\u2019s judiciary and typically has tight security.",
      "The attacker, who was armed with a handgun, killed himself, IRNA said.",
      "\u201cAccording to initial investigations, the person in question did not have a case in the Supreme Court nor was he a client of the branches of the court,\u201d the judiciary\u2019s Mizan news agency said. \u201cCurrently, investigations have been launched to identify and arrest the perpetrators of this terrorist act.\u201d",
      "Asghar Jahangir, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s judiciary, separately told Iranian state television that the shooter had been an \u201cinfiltrator,\u201d suggesting he had worked at the courthouse where the killings took place.",
      "Unlike the U.S. Supreme Court, the Iranian Supreme Court has many branches spread across the country. It is the highest court in Iran and can hear appeals on decisions made by lower courts.",
      "Razini had been targeted previously. In January 1999, attackers on motorcycles hurled an explosive at his vehicle, wounding him as he left work as the head of the judiciary in Tehran.",
      "Mogheiseh had been under sanctions from the U.S. Treasury since 2019. At the time, the Treasury described him as having \u201coverseen countless unfair trials, during which charges went unsubstantiated and evidence was disregarded.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe is notorious for sentencing scores of journalists and internet users to lengthy prison terms,\u201d the Treasury said. Mogheiseh had pressed charges against members of Iran\u2019s Baha\u2019i minority \u201cafter they reportedly held prayer and worship ceremonies with other members,\u201d the Treasury said.",
      "Both men had been named by activists and exiles as taking part in the 1988 executions, which came at the end of Iran\u2019s long war with Iraq. After Iran\u2019s then-Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini accepted a U.N.-brokered ceasefire, members of the exiled Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, or MEK, heavily armed by Saddam Hussein, stormed across the Iranian border in a surprise attack.",
      "Iran ultimately blunted their assault, but the attack set the stage for the sham retrials of political prisoners, militants and others that would become known as \u201cdeath commissions.\u201d",
      "International rights groups estimate that as many as 5,000 people were executed, while the MEK puts the number at 30,000. Iran has never fully acknowledged the executions, apparently carried out on Khomeini\u2019s orders, though some argue that other top officials were effectively in charge in the months before his 1989 death.",
      "The MEK declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press.",
      "While Mogheiseh never addressed the accusation he took part in the 1988 \u201cdeath commissions,\u201d Razini gave a 2017 interview published by Iran\u2019s Shargh newspaper in which he defended the panels as \u201cfair and completely in accordance with the law.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur friends and I who are among the 20 judges in the country, we did our best to ensure the security of that time and the years after and from then, we guaranteed that the hypocrites (the MEK) could never become powerful in this country,\u201d he reportedly said."

      "The arrangement jibes with Trump\u2019s larger goal of stocking important government jobs with people he deems loyal to his agenda.",

      "\u201cThe way this will work, and how I anticipate it will work, is these envoys work for the president in coordination with us,\u201d he said.",
      "\"These are people who will be focused on this like a laser,\" he added.",
      "A former aide to Rubio, Alex Conant, said in an interview that Rubio is steeped in foreign policy as a onetime member of both the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees and won\u2019t be outflanked by special envoys.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to know more than all these special envoys,\u201d Conant said. \u201cI don\u2019t think secretaries of state love having a bunch of special envoys, because those are jobs that he should be doing. But he will have his hands full regardless, and he\u2019ll have the ear of the president, regardless.\u201d",
      "Since the election, Trump has named at least 10 special envoys or deputies, apart from the ambassadors he has also nominated.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump hasn\u2019t even been sworn in yet and he has already played a critical role in securing a Middle East peace plan involving the release of hostages who have been held by Hamas for over a year,\" a Trump transition spokesman, Kush Desai, said in a statement to NBC News. \"President Trump will continue to deliver results for the American people with his peace-through-strength diplomacy, as he did in his first term when he presided over a historic era of global peace.\"",
      "Steven Witkoff, a New York real estate executive who will concentrate on the Middle East, has already played a role in reaching the ceasefire deal announced Wednesday in the war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Witkoff was golfing with Trump during an alleged assassination attempt in September at Trump\u2019s golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. He's also set to be one of the speakers at Trump's pre-inauguration rally Sunday, along with conservative figures like Hulk Hogan, Megyn Kelly and Elon Musk.",
      "Trump is making Keith Kellogg, a retired Army general, a special envoy for the warring nations of Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg served in senior national security positions in Trump\u2019s first term and is an ardent supporter. In his 2021 memoir, \"War by Other Means,\" Kellogg called Trump \"a patriotic man with uncanny political instincts.\"",
      "Another special envoy is Richard Grenell, an ambassador to Germany in Trump's first term and also an acting director of national intelligence.",
      "Grenell, who campaigned for Trump, \u201cwill work in some of the hottest spots around the world, including Venezuela and North Korea,\u201d Trump said in announcing the pick.",
      "More envoys are on the way. On Thursday, Trump named actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone \u201cambassadors\u201d for Hollywood. All are supporters; Stallone has likened Trump to \u201cthe second George Washington.\u201d",
      "As Trump described it, their mission is to bring movies to foreign countries and thus improve Hollywood\u2019s bottom line.",
      "Not all of the envoys have Trump\u2019s confidence. He named Morgan Ortagus, a State Department spokeswoman in his first term, as a deputy to Witkoff, but he wrote in the announcement that he was doing so to appease fellow Republicans.",
      "\u201cEarly on, Morgan fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson,\u201d Trump said, without elaborating. (Ortagus said on Fox News in 2016 that she disagreed with Trump\u2019s \u201cisolationist approach to foreign policy.\u201d)",
      "Many presidents have seen value in bringing in special envoys to tackle thorny problems abroad. It\u2019s a way of reassuring Americans that the White House is focusing attention on particular trouble spots.",
      "If the envoys exercise \u201csignificant authority\u201d on the government\u2019s behalf, they must be confirmed by the Senate, according to an aide to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "Former President Barack Obama appointed envoys to manage tensions in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan and other places. During his second term, a group that represents U.S. foreign service officers put out a report showing that Obama had at least 30 special envoys and concluding that was far too many.",
      "\u201cIn recent years, the number of special envoys and representatives has increased substantially, diluting the brand and reducing effectiveness,\" according to the report from the American Foreign Service Association. \"Overall, we propose paring back their number substantially to a few key positions that report directly to the secretary [of state], have clarity of mission, access to resources and communicate. ...",
      "\u201cA special envoy can pull away responsibility from the bureaus and senior [foreign service officers], with the predictable effect on morale and the [State Department\u2019s] ability to function effectively,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn addition, the secretary does not have the capacity to supervise them all.\u201d",
      "That report came out 11 years ago. A spokesman for the association said that \u201cour position has not changed\u201d since then."

      "Russian forces unleashed a combined drone and missile strike on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv early on Saturday, killing at least three people in a central district, city officials said.",

      "A metro station and water pipe were also damaged, said Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko.",
      "Rescue workers plodded through a flooded street as they sifted through debris. The charred remains of a van were visible in front of the station, whose fa\u00e7ade was marked by twisted metal and blown-out windows.",
      "\u201cRussian forces initially launched drones and then a ballistic-missile strike,\u201d parliamentary ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets wrote on social media. \u201cThese acts merely underscore the enemy\u2019s ruthlessness and barbarity.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate comment from Moscow, which typically denies targeting civilians.",
      "Russia also struck the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, where the regional governor said ten people were wounded and the offices of an industrial facility were damaged.",
      "The Ukrainian military said it had destroyed 24 of 39 drones and two of four missiles launched by Russia across various parts of\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0during the overnight attack.",
      "On Friday, a Russian missile strike on the city of Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s hometown, killed four people and partially destroyed an educational facility, officials said.",
      "Russia has carried out regular air strikes on towns and cities far behind the front line of its almost\u00a0three-year-old invasion\u00a0of\u00a0Ukraine, targeting critical infrastructure in particular."
