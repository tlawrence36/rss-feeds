      "Each \u201cSNL\u201d episode holds at least some surprises, and Sunday\u2019s special is no different. While NBC has revealed some of the stars who are expected to appear, many of the special's moments, cameos and music performances remain a surprise.",

      "The British Academy Film Awards, or BAFTAs, have given audiences some great moments in recent years",
      "The British Academy Film Awards, or BAFTAs, have given audiences some great moments in recent years. Remember Ariana DeBose\u2019s \u201cAngela Basset did the thing,\u201d that awkward performance that had a joyful second life as a joke? Or Ryan Gosling\u2019s wink at Emma Stone last year that had internet shippers in a tizzy?",
      "The worst part is that for some parts of the world, including the U.S., they\u2019re also not the easiest to watch \u2014 or at least a little harder than just turning on ABC (and soon Hulu) to watch the Oscars.",
      "The Associated Press is here to help those without a BritBox subscription with a rundown of the best and most memorable moments of the night, where \u201cAnora\u201d did not sweep (though Mikey Madison did triumph over best actress front-runner Demi Moore), \u201cConclave\u201d won big and \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d proved it\u2019s still a contender.",
      "Host David Tennant got the ceremony off to an amusing start with a pre-recorded bit where various actors give him a little pep talk, appearing in his dressing room mirror \u2014 including fellow Scot Brian Cox, who kicked off a rousing rendition of The Proclaimers song \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles).\u201d Tennant took over and brought the anthem into the room, where Selena Gomez seemed genuinely surprised when he tapped her shoulder and inserted her name into the song. There were the celebrity participants of course, James McAvoy, Camila Cabello and Colman Domingo among them. But even some not \u201cin the show\u201d sang along happily as well, Saoirse Ronan and Jack Lowden included. Others, like Adrien Brody and Demi Moore, did not seem to be part of the chorus.",
      "No presenter wants a John Travolta \u201cAdele Dazeem\u201d moment or, worse, a Faye Dunaway \u201cLa La Land\u201d flap, and you could see the wheels turning in Gomez\u2019s head as she looked at the card for the debut by a British writer, director or producer award. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say,\u201d she said quietly from stage, looking at her co-star and co-presenter, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, before looking further down on the card. \u201cOh, \u2018Kneecap,\u2019\u201d she said, quietly adding, \u201cRich\u201d and simply avoiding the writer-director\u2019s last name, Peppiatt.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg started off his best screenplay win for \u201cA Real Pain\u201d with some signature, self-deprecating jokes about how neither he, his wife nor the person who sat him thought he was going to win. The audience laughed loudly when he said that\u2019s why his wife didn\u2019t attend the ceremony. But he quickly turned sincere, offering a touching tribute to his wife, Anna Strout, whom he credited with helping him learn about the world around him. \u201cYou\u2019ve put every worthwhile thought into my head over the last 20 years,\u201d Eisenberg said. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Salda\u00f1a was feeling the pressure of \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u2019s\u201d diminished Oscar dreams two days before voting closes. Or maybe she was just really overwhelmed to win the best supporting actress BAFTA. Regardless, she let her emotions show in a teary and intense speech, in which she poked fun at her own inability to do a good British accent, shouted out her makeup artist as her closest confidant and made a case for the film.",
      "\u201cFilms are supposed to change hearts and challenge minds, and I hope, I hope that \u2018Emilia P\u00e9rez\u2019 did something like this,\u201d she said. \u201cVoices need to be heard, just not my English accent. Bye, guys.\u201d",
      "In memoriam segments don\u2019t need to be flashy. All you need is a thoughtful reel, Jeff Goldblum and a piano, it turns out. He played \u201cAs Time Goes By.\u201d",
      "Warwick Davis joked that he\u2019d keep his BAFTA Fellowship acceptance speech \u201cshort,\u201d telling the audience that it\u2019s OK, they can laugh. \u201cThis is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I\u2019ve been in \u2018Star Wars,\u2019\u201d he said. Davis also got emotional, speaking about his wife who died last year.",
      "\u201cShe was always so supportive of my career, encouraging me to grab every opportunity with both hands,\u201d he said. \u201cSince then, life has been pretty tough for me. Thanks to the support of our wonderful children, I\u2019ve been able to continue working and engaging in life.\u201d",
      "Moore has been sweeping many of the best actress prizes, but \u201cAnora\u201d star Madison got a great, big moment and win. Though she said she didn't expect it, and said she should have \u201clistened to my publicist and written a speech,\u201d Madison gave a notably thoughtful speech, paying tribute to her director, producer, co-stars, mother (her favorite scene partner) and the sex worker community.",
      "\u201cI just want to say: I see you. You deserve respect and human decency,\u201d she said. \u201cI will always be a friend and an ally, and I implore others to do the same.\u201d"

      "The discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at an Indian residential school in Canada in 2021 was just the catalyst for \u201cSugarcane.\"",
      "The discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at an Indian residential school in Canada in 2021 was just the catalyst for \u201cSugarcane.\u201d",
      "Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie, the filmmakers behind the Oscar-nominated documentary, spent years investigating the truth behind just one of the institutions. \u201cSugarcane,\u201d now streaming on Hulu, paints a horrifying picture of the systemic abuses inflicted by the state-funded school and exposes for the first time a pattern of infanticide and babies born to Indigenous girls and fathered by priests.",
      "In the year since it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, \u201cSugarcane\u201d has screened at the White House, for Canadian Parliament and for over a dozen indigenous communities in North America, sparking a grassroots movement and reckoning to find the truth about the other schools. It also marks the first time that an Indigenous North American filmmaker has received an Oscar nomination.",
      "From the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died. Nearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations",
      "Canada\u2019s residential schools were based on similar facilities in the United States, where Catholic and Protestant denominations operated more than 150 boarding schools between the 19th and 20th centuries, according to researchers, that also were home to rampant abuse.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too often that we look everywhere else in the world to horrors and abuses happening, and that\u2019s important, but Native issues are rarely the issue of the day, and we believe that they deserve to be,\u201d Kassie said. \u201cThis story is the genocide that happened across North America, and we\u2019ve never grappled with it. Native people have rarely been the focal point of that kind of countrywide dialogue. We hope that \u2019Sugarcane\u201d helps to change that.\u201d",
      "As an investigative journalist and documentarian, Kassie had spent a decade making films about human rights abuses all over the world, from Afghanistan to Niger, but she\u2019d never turned her lens to her own country. When the news broke about the unmarked graves, she felt drawn to the story and reached out to NoiseCat to see if he\u2019d want to help. They became friends as cub reporters in New York who just happened to share neighboring desks.",
      "\u201cIn the years since, Julian had gone on to become an incredible writer and thinker and journalist focusing on indigenous life in North America. It felt like the natural fit,\u201d she said.",
      "While he was mulling it over, she went looking for a group to focus on and landed on St. Joseph\u2019s Mission near the Sugarcane Reservation of Williams Lake in British Columbia. Unbeknownst to her, that was the school NoiseCat's family attended. He\u2019d heard stories about his father being born nearby and found in a dumpster. Over the course of making the film they\u2019d discover that he was actually born in a dormitory and found in the school\u2019s incinerator.",
      "\u201cIt was a process for me to ultimately decide to tell the story in a personal and familial way,\u201d said NoiseCat, who during the making of the film lived with his father for the first time since he was around 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt became very clear that he had these unaddressed questions from his birth and upbringing, and that I was in a position to help him ask those questions and in so doing, to address some of my own enduring pains and complications from his abandonment of me,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cThe big thing, though, was going to the Vatican with the late Chief Rick Gilbert and witnessing his incredible bravery.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just been incredibly fortunate that this film has had real impact,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cI was really scared that telling such a personal and sometimes painful story might be a harmful thing. But really, thankfully, it\u2019s been a healing thing, not just for my family and our participants, but for Indian Country more broadly.\u201d",
      "Over the last year as the film has played at various festivals and for Indigenous communities on reservations, Kassie said that more survivors have been coming forward with their stories.",
      "In October, former President Joe Biden also formally apologized to Native Americans for the \u201csin\u201d of a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated children from their parents, calling it a \u201cblot on American history.\"",
      "\u201cThis is the origin story of North America,\u201d Kassie said. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of how the land was taken by separating six generations of kids, indigenous kids from their families... (and) most people don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Kassie noted that while \u201cSugarcane\u201d is inspiring conversations within communities, it comes at a political moment where governments are not actively supporting continued investigation and accountability.",
      "In a film industry with deep roots in the Western genre and problematic, racist depictions of Native Americans as impediments to westward expansion, authentic representation of indigenous stories on screen is still in the early days. In 97 years of the Oscars, no Native American person has ever won a competitive acting prize. Lily Gladstone, who is an executive producer on \u201cSugarcane,\u201d was passed over last year for best actress.",
      "When the Oscar nomination came through for \u201cSugarcane,\u201d they made sure they had their facts right before touting its own historic nature: NoiseCat was indeed the first indigenous North American filmmaker to get one.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the same time, it\u2019s kind of shocking.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe hope the film shows that there\u2019s still so much about this foundational story in North America that needs to be known and therefore needs to be investigated,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cThis film should be seen not as an ending, but a beginning to a real grappling with this story.\u201d",
      "He added: \"More broadly, there are so many painful, important, beautiful and sometimes even triumphant stories that come from Native people that come from Indian Country. It\u2019s my hope that more Native stories and storytellers and films get recognized moving forward and get made.\u201d",
      "If \u201cSugarcane\u201d is named the winner at the Oscars on March 2, NoiseCat promised it will be an acceptance speech to watch.",
      "\u201cWe will make it a moment,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cIf we win, I\u2019m going to get up there, I\u2019m going to say something, and we\u2019re going to do it well too.\u201d",

      "An upcoming edition of \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d combines the dark and singular talents of two literary giants who apparently never met: Stephen King and the late Maurice Sendak.",
      "HarperCollins Publishers announced Thursday that the King-Sendak re-imagining of the famed Brothers Grimm tale about two lost children in a frightening forest is scheduled for Sept. 2. King's words will be complemented by sketches Sendak drew up for set and costume designs for a 1997 production of the Humperdinck opera adaptation.",
      "The book was initiated by the Maurice Sendak Foundation. King, author of \u201cThe Shining,\u201d \u201cCarrie\u201d and other horror classics, said he decided to agree to the project after seeing Sendak's illustrations.",
      "\u201cTwo of his pictures in particular spoke to me: One was of the wicked witch on her broom with a bag of kidnapped children riding behind her; the other was of the infamous candy house becoming a terrible face. I thought, \u2018This is what the house really looks like, a devil sick with sin, and it only shows that face when the kids turn their backs. I wanted to write that!\u2019\" King said in a statement issued through HarperCollins.",
      "\"To me, it was the essence of this story and, really, all fairy tales: a sunny exterior, a dark and terrible center, brave and resourceful children. In a way, I have been writing about kids like Hansel and Gretel for much of my life.\u201d",
      "Representatives for King say he has no memory of meeting Sendak, although King has expressed admiration for the musical \u201cReally Rosie,\u201d a Sendak-Carole King collaboration.",
      "Lynn Caponera, the Sendak foundation's executive director, said in a statement that she thought King ideal because outside of the Grimms, \u201che's the master of scary stories and a wonderful writer to boot.\u201d",
      "Sendak, who died in 2012, spoke about Hansel and Gretel around the time he was working on the opera. In an interview published in the 2003 book \u201cThe Art of Maurice Sendak\u201d he called the fairy tale \u201cthe most profound\u201d of the Grimm canon.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, most of Grimm is about heroic children. \u2018Hansel and Gretel\u2019 are the most heroic of them all,\u201d said Sendak, known for \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are,\u201d \u201cIn the Night Kitchen\u201d and other children's favorites. \"It\u2019s the toughest story in the world and people are afraid of it, yet it\u2019s famous because it\u2019s so truthful.\u201d",

      "Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece.",
      "Bowers\u2019 work on \u201c The Wild Robot \u201d continues to solidify his place as one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after composers, earning him a nomination for best original score. His score complements the film\u2019s stunning visuals and emotional depth, capturing the journey of Roz, an out-of-place robot striving to connect with animals who struggle to understand it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being really clear with each story, understanding what the emotions is and what\u2019s stirring inside of me,\u201d said Bowers, 35, a Grammy and Emmy-nominated composer who won an Academy Award for the short documentary \u201cThe Last Repair Shop.\u201d He\u2019s also worked on Oscar-winning films such as \u201cKing Richard\u201d and \u201c Green Book.\u201d",
      "For \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bowers first studied the early black-and-white sketches, where he uncovered his emotions toward the characters, before capturing those feelings at his piano, crafting a musical narrative filled with heart. Bowers said tapping into his emotions has never come easily, but he found inspiration in his journey as a father, watching his wife sacrifice her body during pregnancy, to help craft sounds that capture the essence of parenthood.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Bowers reflects on what the Oscar nomination means to him, the challenges of composing for animated films, the lasting influence of five-time Oscar winner John Williams and why Kobe Bryant \u2019s advice continues to resonate with him.",
      "The Oscars will air March 2.",
      "____",
      "BOWERS: It means a lot. As a kid, that's how I found a lot of composers. I was looking at that (Oscar noms) list. I would look at who's nominated then go listen to those scores, so it became a way to expand my collection of CDs. It means something to be a part of this history. No matter what happens in my career from here on out, somebody's going to look at this year's list and see my name. To be nominated, you are chosen by the music branch of the academy ... filled with composers who I've been a fan of since I was a kid. ... It makes me feel like I've done something meaningful.",
      "BOWERS: Yeah, he was the master of memorable melody. If there's a piece of score in a move that you can sing, it's probably John Williams. One thing I took from him is that he came up in a time of composers who were storytellers and made sure the music was also developing the story. When those themes come back at the most pivotal point in the movie, we feel something emotional. I remember for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I studied the last 30 minutes of \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\u201d primarily because the last 20-30 minutes of \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d is all action. I thought, \u201cHow did John Williams approach this?\" Because \u201cStar Wars\u201d was so iconic with its themes.",
      "BOWERS: The only moment was when I played the main theme. I was kind of just wanting to see if it triggered that complexity. I do this often with my wife where I\u2019ll have a theme that I\u2019m playing it and ask her \u201cWhat does this remind of, or what does this make you feel? I remember when I played her that sequence, which was a work in progress, and she got emotional. She cried watching just that three-minute sequence, having no idea of what the movie was about. I felt like I was on the right track. ... It\u2019s reminding her of all the complex emotions she feels as a mom. I struck a nerve in a way that could be valuable.",
      "BOWERS: It\u2019s definitely more challenging. If you talk to any composer, they\u2019ll talk about the fact that animation is its own challenge. Most animated films have almost wall-to-wall music where music kind of doesn\u2019t ever stop. Whereas, a lot of live action, you can sit for five minutes and not have any music and be OK.",
      "BOWERS: I did a lot of work for Kobe. He talked about John Williams being my Michael Jordan. He was all about obsessing enough about your craft, so that you are ready for anything. The stuff I wrote for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I learned from when he would challenge me to write. I wrote this audiobook for him, and he was like \u201cYou know this has to be better than the music for \u2018E.T.\u2019?",
      "I laughed. And he was like \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not (expletive) kidding with you, right?\u201d",
      "He was always telling me, \u201cIf you\u2019re not taking on something that\u2019s going to make you a better artist by the time you finish it, then you are wasting your time.\u201d",
      "That kind of mentality is the way I approach everything. I want to take on as many things as possible. If that opportunity came, I\u2019d be prepared for it.",
      "BOWERS: I feel like my parents put me on this track from the very beginning. They wanted me to play piano before I was born. They gave me lessons and like found teachers for me. There\u2019s kind of like this debt I owe to them. I have to be as great as I possibly can. But it\u2019s also just me trying to live up to the steps my parents already got started for me.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Golden State Warriors are known for their electrifying plays and superstar Stephen Curry, but now the team is pioneering a fresh gameplan: blending sports and entertainment in a way no NBA franchise has before.",
      "As the first and only NBA team with its own record label, Golden State Entertainment, the Warriors are expanding their reach with \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a new album released this week. The project featuring the Bay Area\u2019s top music artists \u2014 from E-40, Too Short, Saweetie, G-Eazy, Goapele, LaRussell and Larry June \u2014 arrives just in time for the league's All-Star Game weekend in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cA basketball team with a record label is unheard of until now, which is a testament to the Warriors and the Bay,\u201d said P-Lo, a Filipino-American rapper who produced \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a collaborative release between Golden State Entertainment and EMPIRE, a distribution and publishing company. He will perform live during an NBA All-Star tipoff party on Thursday at Thrive City, a 11-acre community gathering space surrounding the Chase Center.",
      "\u201cThis is about innovation, bringing a new idea to the table,\u201d said P-Lo, a lifelong Warriors fan who has worked with artists such as Yo Gotti, Saweetie and Kehlani. He's no stranger to the franchise, riding his convertible car as part of the Warriors championship parade, celebrating the team's title in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe're here to break barriers while I'm trying to process it all,\" he added. \"I'm grateful for this opportunity.\u201d",

      "\u201cFor me, to be the first team to have a music company, or production company, it\u2019s kinda cool,\u201d Payton said. \u201cP-Lo is running it, and getting it done. I know there\u2019s a lot of talented Bay Area artists behind it, so it\u2019s something to look forward to and be excited about.\u201d",
      "P-Lo played a key role in bringing together the Bay Area\u2019s top artists, contributing to all nine tracks on the album. He began the process late last summer, collaborating with local talent to craft a well-rounded project.",
      "\u201cP-Lo can produce, rap and bring all these artists who are like family to him,\u201d said David Kelly, an executive with the Warriors. He spearheaded the launch of Golden State Entertainment in 2022 before the team won the championship that year.",
      "Several NBA teams have partnered with artists over the years: Drake as the Toronto Raptors\u2019 global ambassador, Jay-Z as a former minority owner of the Brooklyn Nets, and the Miami Heat collaborating with DJ Khaled, who performed at games. The Atlanta Hawks have also embraced their city\u2019s rap scene, working with T.I., 2 Chainz, and Quavo.",
      "But an NBA team with its own record label and entertainment division? That\u2019s where Kelly saw an opportunity for the Warriors to break new ground. He said creating a label, intersecting hip-hop and basketball made sense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of authentic and natural to the culture,\u201d said Kelly, who joined the organization in 2011 and currently is the chief business officer of Golden State Entertainment. \u201cIt seems like a lot of times people try to force them apart or mesh them together that don\u2019t make sense. But if you grew up a part of both, they naturally intertwine.\u201d",
      "Kelly first pitched the idea of the Warriors having a record label to then-president Rick Welts before bringing it to the team\u2019s owner, Joe Lacob, and co-executive chairman Peter Guber. He said the Warriors' leadership embraced his vision, and he hopes more pro teams will follow suit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s seeing the culture being presented in a way that\u2019s true and reflective on a grand international scale,\u201d said Kelly, a former Chicago-based rapper, whose stage name was Capital D. \u201cHopefully this is the first of many for Golden State and the culture.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday.",
      "Movies like \u201cWicked,\"\u201cInside Out 2\" and \u201cThe Substance\u201d lifted Hollywood's theatrical releases to gender parity in leading roles in 2024. Of the 100 top domestic grossing films in 2024, 42% had female protagonists, and 42% had male protagonists, according to a report issued by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University.",
      "The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which also released its annual study Tuesday, found that 54% of the top 100 films at the box office in 2024 featured girls and women as protagonists. That's a massive jump from just the year prior, when 30% of films featured women in lead roles. In 2007, when the USC annual study began, that figure was just 20%.",
      "\"This is the first time we can say that gender equality has been reached in top-grossing films,\u201d Stacy L. Smith, founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn 2024, three of the top five films had a girl or woman in a leading role, as did five of the top 10 films \u2014 including the number one film of the year, Disney\u2019s \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019\" added Smith. \"We have always known that female-identified leads would make money. This is not the result of an economic awakening but is due to a number of different constituencies and efforts \u2014 at advocacy groups, at studios, through DEI initiatives \u2014 to assert the need for equality on screen.\u201d",
      "Other metrics suggested the gains in leading roles masked still-endemic disparity throughout Hollywood. The percentage of female characters in speaking roles increased from 35% to 37% in 2024, according to the San Diego State study. Major female characters rose from 38% in 2023 to 39% in 2024.",
      "\u201cFilms such as \u2018The Substance\u2019 pushed back hard against a culture that considers women disposable,\u201d Lauzen stated. \u201cWhile the number of films with female protagonists rose to a historic high in 2024 after a dismally lean 2023, the percentages of women in the more stable categories of major and speaking roles reflected only minor gains.\u201d",
      "Universal Studios, which is led by Donna Langley, was the studio with the best record for female representation. In 2024, 66.7% of Universal releases centered on girls and women, according to the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.",
      "Neither study captures the large number of films released directly on streaming platforms or films that fall outside the top 100 movies in theaters. But for decades, those top box-office films have offered a snapshot of a film industry that has long failed to come close to reflecting the demographics of American society.",
      "That remains the case for underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, who account for roughly 42% of the U.S. population.",
      "In the top 2024 films in 2024, 25% included an underrepresented lead or co-lead, according to Annenberg. In those 25 movies, the lead or co-leads were 38.% Black, 15.4% Asian or Asian American and 3.9% Hispanic.",
      "That was a substantial decrease from 2023, when 37 leads or co-leads were people of color.",
      "\u201cThe progress we saw for female-identified leads was not matched by the findings for underrepresented leads,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis downturn signifies a lack of investment in storytelling that reflects the audience as a whole. The reality is that audiences want to see stories about women and people of color \u2014 studios and filmmakers do not have to choose between the two.\u201d"

      "Lawyers will give their closing arguments at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of two felony counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm",
      "LOS ANGELES -- There's one essential difference between arguments at rapper A$AP Rocky 's trial: Prosecutors will say Thursday that the hip-hop star fired two shots at a former friend from a handgun, while defense lawyers will say he fired blanks from a gun that wasn't real.",
      "Jurors should begin deliberations by the afternoon on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for the 2021 shooting. If they convict Rocky of both, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The Grammy-nominated music star, fashion mogul and actor is the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear in court for closing arguments after showing up sporadically \u2014 most recently last week, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Testimony at the trial ended Tuesday, when Rocky and his lawyers told a judge he would not take the stand.",
      "The prosecution's case rests largely on the credibility of the man Rocky is alleged to have fired on. A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, became friends with Rocky, born Rakim Mayers, in high school in New York, where both were members of a crew of creative types called the A$AP Mob.",
      "Their friendship continued after Rocky first gained global fame with a pair of No. 1 albums in 2012 and 2013, but by Nov. 6, 2021 their bond had become a beef.",
      "They met up outside a Hollywood hotel, and scuffled as soon as they saw each other. In a second confrontation moments later, Rocky fired the shots. Relli said his knuckles were grazed by one of them. The fights were partially captured on surveillance videos that are not clear enough for easy interpretation.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy, another member of the crew who was with Rocky, testified that Relli had been the aggressor, and that Rocky fired the shots as a warning to stop him from attacking another member of their crew.",
      "Twelvyy testified that Rocky fired blanks from a starter pistol that the rapper had been carrying for security since a music video shoot months earlier, and that everyone involved in the incident knew it. Rocky's tour manager also testified that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Neither gun was found or presented as evidence.",
      "Police who searched the area after a report of a shooting found no physical evidence, but Relli himself went to a police department two days later with two shell casings he said he'd picked up after returning to the scene.",
      "In closing arguments, the defense will contend that video evidence and text messages can't be trusted, nor can Relli. He also filed a civil suit in the case, and Rocky's attorneys will cast him as a jealous opportunist out for the money of a former friend who became famous. Relli vowed to do just that in text messages and in phone calls recorded by a mutual friend who gave the recordings to Rocky. Relli said in his testimony that the calls were faked.",
      "The prosecution will argue that Relli is justly seeking money after a genuine wrong was done to him. They point out that Relli's communications around the incident tell a consistent story \u2014 and never does he mention making anything up or knowing Rocky carried a prop gun. Prosecutors are likely to argue that the whole idea of the starter pistol \u2014 which only fires blanks \u2014 is a preposterous lie coordinated by Rocky's inner circle.",
      "In one of a series of arguments between lawyers that grew so nasty and personal during the trial that the judge began threatening fines, Deputy District Attorney John Lewin called the prop gun argument \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to show the pack racing,\u201d Fox Sports director Artie Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp about 50 times during Sunday\u2019s race.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform. It\u2019s been at every Daytona 500 since 1962.",
      "During that streak, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.",
      "Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn\u2019t much different from traveling on a small plane. The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph \u2014 well below the cars pushing 200 mph on the track.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of Americana,\u201d blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it in the world.\u201d",
      "The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp\u2019s street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled \u201cIt Was A Good Day.\u201d",
      "But not just anyone can climb aboard. Rides are invitation only even though phones at blimp headquarters \u2014 the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio \u2014 ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride.",
      "As part of the blimp\u2019s 100-year anniversary celebration, however, Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive club and win a ride. The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one of Goodyear\u2019s airship hangars.",
      "It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no doubt.",
      "The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning, with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching (and hearing) race cars turning laps.",
      "Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania.",
      "But will the blimp survive another 100 years?",
      "Drone imagery and resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers.",
      "But given the blimp\u2019s longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one should bet against it sticking around for generations to come.",
      "\u201cDespite changes in technology and our environment, people still get so excited to see the blimp,\" Kervern said. \u201cIt's just an iconic symbol for our nation.\u201d",

      "A federal appeals court has upheld singer R. Kelly's racketeering convictions and a 30-year prison sentence, finding he exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women",
      "NEW YORK -- R. Kelly\u2019s racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March.",
      "The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking.",
      "Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling \u201cunprecedented,\" saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law \u201cto situations absurdly remote\u201d from the statute's intent.",
      "Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago.",
      "The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper.",
      "\u201cEnabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp,\u201d the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls.",
      "\u201cEvidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually,\u201d the three-judge panel said.",
      "The appeals court said it was \u201cneither arbitrary nor irrational\u201d that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify.",
      "\u201cNone of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,\u201d the appeals court said.",
      "The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, \u201cwere properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.\u201d",
      "Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's \u201cexcellent opinion,\u201d but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available.",
      "\u201cThis was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,\u201d Bonjean said.",
      "Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d and the cult classic \u201cTrapped in the Closet,\u201d a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue.",
      "Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex.",
      "Widespread outrage over Kelly\u2019s sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly.\u201d",

      "Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis also did not attend a scheduled hearing in another case, in which he is accused of fighting with another man at the Clark County Detention Center in late December.",

      "Davis, who pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the 1996 death of the rap icon in Las Vegas, has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest.",
      "Lawyer Carl Arnold told Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny that Davis would \u201cprobably want to be here\u201d for the trial readiness hearing and requested that it be pushed to next week. Kierny agreed and set a Feb. 18 date for it. Kierny said she thought Davis was absent because he was in the other hearing.",
      "The trial is scheduled to begin in March.",
      "A grand jury indicted Davis separately last week on charges of battery and challenging someone to a fight, moving that case from Justice Court to state District Court. He is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.",
      "A correctional officer told grand jurors that he was escorting Davis back to his unit when he and the other man exchanged words and then started fighting in a common room, according to the Review-Journal. Davis\u2019 legal team said he was ambushed and acted in self-defense.",
      "In the Shakur case, Arnold argues that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.",
      "Kierny has said Davis is not protected from prosecution because he lacks proof of any such agreements.",
      "Prosecutors say they have strong evidence against him, including his own accounts of the shooting in a tell-all memoir. Davis, an ex-gang leader, is accused of orchestrating the killing near the Las Vegas Strip."

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs is suing NBC Universal over a documentary that he says falsely accuses him of being a serial murderer who had sex with underage girls as he awaits trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York state court says the documentary, \u201c Diddy: Making of a Bad Boy,\u201d included statements that NBC Universal either knew were false or published with reckless disregard for the truth in order to defame the founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\u201cIndeed, the entire premise of the Documentary assumes that Mr. Combs has committed numerous heinous crimes, including serial murder, rape of minors, and sex trafficking of minors, and attempts to crudely psychologize him,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cIt maliciously and baselessly jumps to the conclusion that Mr. Combs is a \u2018monster\u2019 and \u2018an embodiment of Lucifer\u2019 with \u2018a lot of similarities\u2019 to Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for NBC Universal and the entertainment company that produced the documentary, which is also named in the suit, didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment. The documentary premiered last month on Peacock TV, the network\u2019s streaming service.",
      "\u201cFrom his childhood to becoming a mogul, this raw look at Sean Combs\u2019 journey through exclusive footage and candid interviews explores his rise, controversies and the man behind the music,\u201d a description of the documentary on Peacock\u2019s website reads.",
      "Combs, who is seeking no less than $100 million in damages, has been in Brooklyn federal prison since his September arrest on racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges.",
      "Federal prosecutors say he used his wealth and influence to coerce female victims and male sex workers into drug-fueled, dayslong sexual performances known as \u201cFreak Offs.\u201d",
      "They say Combs used blackmail and violence to intimidate and threaten his victims in a pattern of abuse that goes back to the early 2000s.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial is slated to start in May.",
      "Erica Wolff, an attorney for Combs, said NBC and the other entities named in the suit \u201cmaliciously and recklessly broadcast outrageous lies\u201d in order to \u201cline their own pockets\u201d by driving viewership to the documentary.",
      "\u201cIn making and broadcasting these falsehoods, among others, Defendants seek only to capitalize on the public\u2019s appetite for scandal without any regard for the truth and at the expense of Mr. Combs\u2019s right to a fair trial,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cMr. Combs brings this lawsuit to hold Defendants accountable for the extraordinary damage their reckless statements have caused.\u201d",
      "Combs\u2019 lawsuit says the documentary \u201cfalsely, recklessly, and maliciously\u201d accuses him of murdering Kimberly Porter, Christopher Wallace and Dwight Arrington Myers, among other notable names.",

      "Elsewhere, the complaint says the documentary delved into claims Combs had sex with underage girls, citing as evidence a civil complaint that's been \u201cthoroughly discredited.\u201d Combs\u2019 lawyers say the women referenced in that complaint have since confirmed they were adults at the time.",

      "In discussion with a Los Angeles judge on the last phases of Rocky's trial, his lawyer Joe Tacopina said that either his client would testify early Tuesday or the defense would rest its case. An attorney for the prosecution said his team was going to spend the night preparing for Rocky's testimony.",
      "He is not legally required to testify, and subjecting a defendant to a difficult cross-examination is often a major gamble in criminal cases.",
      "Tacopina said before the trial that Rocky was \u201ceager to tell his story. He would love the opportunity to do so.\u201d",
      "The attorneys could not give comment outside court Monday because a judge has forbidden them from speaking to the media. Rocky faces up to 24 years in prison if convicted, after turning down a pre-trial plea deal that could have led to just 180 days in jail.",
      "If Rocky testifies, he\u2019ll probably have to face a long and combative cross-examination from Deputy District Attorney John Lewin. In his most famous case, Lewin kept real estate heir Robert Durst on the stand for nine days of relentless questioning before he was convicted of murder.",
      "Rocky is a Grammy-nominated hip-hop star, fashion mogul and the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear Tuesday to watch his testimony.",
      "She has shown up sporadically \u2014 most recently on Friday, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, would likely testify that a gun he fired twice \u2014 in a scuffle with a former friend on a Hollywood street corner in 2021 \u2014 was a starter pistol that only fired blanks, and that he carried it for security.",
      "On Monday, his tour manager became the second witness from Rocky's inner circle to testify that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Lou Levin said he told the rapper it made sense to carry it after Rocky's house had been broken into by a stalker and others.",
      "\u201cSecurity and I thought it would be a good idea, because of the prior violence,\" Levin said. \"It\u2019s just a nonlethal form of self-defense.\u201d",
      "Levin said he got the gun from a video shoot in the summer of 2021, about three months before the incident that led to the charges, and on the day itself.",
      "He told the jury that he returned the phony gun to the music video's co-director, who no longer had it when Levin asked about it after Rocky's arrest. The defense said it does not have the starter pistol now.",
      "Authorities also did not recover the pistol they allege Rocky used.",
      "Levin testified that an ammunition magazine found in Rocky's house by officers serving a search warrant actually belonged to him.",
      "Lewin, the prosecutor, said \u201cyou had to come up with a story\u201d to explain the magazine. He later called every aspect of the story \u201ca lie.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have to come up with a story \u2014 it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Levin said."

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Paul McCartney\u2019s previous New York-area performance took place three years ago at MetLife Stadium, capacity 82,500. His surprise show Tuesday night at the Bowery Ballroom fit, at most, 575.",
      "It was probably less than that since McCartney\u2019s sound board and gear \u2014 too much to fit backstage \u2014 occupied a portion of the floor space at the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the stage.",
      "Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was happening.",
      "\u201cSo, here we are,\u201d McCartney said, grinning. \u201cSome little gig. New York. Why not?\u201d",
      "Later, he added before launching into \u201cLet Me Roll It\u201d: \u201cI can\u2019t quite believe we\u2019re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.\u201d",
      "It was not McCartney\u2019s first impromptu concert. The Beatles, of course, famously performed atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row in London in 1969. Since then he\u2019s made something of a habit of it on trips to New York.",
      "In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the Beatles\u2019 famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his \u201cEgyptian Station.\u201d",
      "With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30 minutes.",
      "For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery.",
      "Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the announcement on Instagram. \u201cI thought: I can do this,\u201d Jaffe said before the show. \u201cI put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.\u201d",
      "Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous, smiling and shaking her head: \u201cI don\u2019t actually believe it.\u201d",
      "Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over to the Bowery Ballroom.",
      "\u201cWe just got lucky,\u201d Sokoloff said. \u201cI\u2019m always learning about these things the day after.\u201d",
      "McCartney took the stage roughly on time at 6:30 p.m. with his regular band, along with a three-member horn section. They had only rehearsed once, the day before, McCartney said. Someone shouted: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to rehearse!\u201d",
      "If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn\u2019t come with a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and also performed \u201cGot To Get You Into My Life,\u201d \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed,\u201d \u201cLady Madonna,\u201d \u201cJet,\u201d \u201cGet Back,\u201d \u201cOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\u201d \u201cLet it Be\u201d and \u201cHey Jude.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlackbird\u201d was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a memory that brought back his first trips to the United States.",
      "\u201cWe were just kids,\u201d McCartney said. \u201cI\u2019ve got grandchildren older than that now.\u201d",
      "In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201d \u201cFrom Me to You.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt had everything to do with the fans, really,\u201d McCartney said.",
      "Before playing the Wings song \u201cMrs. Vanderbilt,\u201d McCartney spoke of playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was exuberant with a newfound freedom. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it gets back to that soon,\u201d he said.",
      "Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set. After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. \u201cThat was a Beatles scream.\u201d Then he asked for more, saying, \u201cOK, let\u2019s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.\u201d All in attendance obliged.",
      "McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, \u201c Now and Then,\u201d a ballad penned by Lennon in the late \u201970s but only released in 2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary, \u201c The Beatles: Get Back.\u201d The song made McCartney wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for John,\u201d he said.",
      "McCartney, who was spotted Sunday at the Super Bowl in New Orleans chatting with Adam Sandler, was in New York for the upcoming \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d 50th anniversary festivities. He\u2019s to be a guest on the star-studded television special Sunday.",
      "It was unclear if McCartney was playing a single show or preparing for something more. He wrapped the Got Back Tour in December and has said he\u2019s hoping to finish a new album this year.",
      "For now, though, it was a one-night-only event. One crowd member asked McCartney if it could go all night. \u201cSome of us need to get some sleep, you know,\u201d he replied.",
      "McCartney still came back, bouncing on the stage for an encore. He closed with the rousing \u201cAbbey Road\u201d send off of \u201cCarry That Weight\u201d and \u201cThe End,\u201d concluded with its immortalized final lines: \u201cAnd in the end/ The love you take/ Is equal to the love you make.\u201d",
      "The crowd, still in disbelief, spilled out into the street. Snow had begun to fall.",

      "Friday's ruling came after a Kansas City judge ruled last year that abortions were now legal in the state but kept certain regulations on the books while a lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates played out.",
      "One regulation required abortion facilities to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities could not comply with some of the licensing rules, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "Planned Parenthood argued that the licensing law required providers to give \u201cmedically unnecessary and invasive\u201d pelvic exams to anyone receiving an abortion, including medication abortions, according to court documents. The plaintiffs also said some of the regulations on Planned Parenthood centers were so strict, \u201cmost health centers or doctors\u2019 office simply do not meet\u201d them.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang said in her ruling that the licensing requirement is \u201cfacially discriminatory because it does not treat services provided in abortion facilities the same as other types of similarly situated health care, including miscarriage care.\u201d",
      "Voters approved the measure adding abortion rights to the constitution in November. That amendment did not legalize abortion in the state outright but instead required judges to reconsider laws that had almost completely banned the procedure.",
      "Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said the group is working quickly to start providing the procedure again in the coming days.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision affirms what we\u2019ve already long known \u2014 the state\u2019s abortion facility licensing requirements were not about patient safety, but rather another politically motivated barrier to prevent patients seeking abortion from getting the care they need,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The ruling is a temporary order pending the outcome of the lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates.",
      "Planned Parenthood and other advocates sued to overturn Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban almost immediately after voters amended the constitution to protect reproductive rights. Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey is fighting the lawsuit.",
      "There was no immediate response to a voice message seeking comment from a spokesperson for the attorney general.",
      "Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, said clinic partners are ready to start providing abortions as soon as next week.",
      "\u201cWith this change the landscape for Missourians and the entire Midwest region will be transformed, as patients will have greater access to abortion care than they have had in years,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in 2024 to enshrining abortion rights in their constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment but will need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "Another measure banning discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. While there is no defined time frame, doctors say it is generally sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",

      "The ongoing measles outbreak in West Texas has doubled in size to 48 cases, mostly in children and teens, making it the state's worst in nearly 30 years.",
      "State health officials said Friday in a news release that those who are infected are either unvaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown. Thirteen people have been hospitalized.",
      "The outbreak has spread from its epicenter in Gaines County, with single-digit cases in nearby Lynn, Terry and Yoakum counties. Officials in the area also expect the outbreak to continue to spread in these communities.",
      "South Plains Public Health District Director Zach Holbrooks said earlier this week that some of the cases appear to be connected to private religious schools.",
      "Texas Department of State Health Services data shows there were 49 cases of measles in Texas in 1996. In 2013, there were 27 cases reported after a person who traveled to Asia returned and interacted with a vaccine-hesitant community, the state reported.",
      "Measles is a highly contagious virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it\u2019s usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.",
      "The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.",
      "Vaccination against measles, a two-shot series, is required for most U.S. kindergarteners in order for them to enroll in public school.",
      "Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. The percentage of kids with exemptions has risen over the last decade from 0.76% in 2014 to 2.32% last year, according to state data.",
      "Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials say that number is likely higher because it doesn't include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.",

      "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a busy soccer calendar",
      "LONDON -- Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a congested soccer calendar.",
      "Arteta said he felt a \u201cbig pain in the tummy\u201d after seeing Kai Havertz pick up a serious hamstring injury at the end of a light training session in Dubai that will rule the Germany forward out for the rest of the season.",
      "It further stretches Arsenal\u2019s resources up front, with Gabriel Jesus having ruptured his ACL, winger Bukayo Saka having not played since December because of a hamstring issue and another wide player, Gabriel Martinelli, set to miss the next month also with a hamstring injury.",
      "Two more games per team were added to the first stage of this season's Champions League, while Arsenal also went deep in the English League Cup \u2014 it was eliminated by Newcastle in the two-legged semifinals \u2014 and is in a title race with Liverpool in the Premier League.",
      "An expanded and revamped Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States at the end of the season and lasts a month, also extends the schedule for many teams, though not Arsenal this year. Some players have openly complained that it is detrimental to their performance and health and the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "For Arteta, it\u2019s no surprise to see injury rates soar at Arsenal because of the extra load on players and what he perceives to be an increased intensity in modern-day soccer.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prove it and the evidence we can provide is very limited in many aspects and every case is very different but already some of them (injuries) we know are based on load and minutes. It's inevitable,\u201d Arteta said Friday. \u201cWe have players who have been injured who have played 130 games over the last two seasons. In the end, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen if you continue to load and load and load.",
      "\u201cIs this season an accumulation of that? Is it the stress of that? Is it luck? Is it preparation? Is it methodology? There are a lot of factors. It\u2019s very difficult to point at something but the schedule that's planned is super-demanding and for certain players, especially explosive players, it\u2019s a real issue.\u201d",
      "Havertz appears to have been unlucky in picking up his injury, with Arteta explaining how the German stretched his leg to stop a shot at a set-piece and \u201cfelt his hamstring go.\u201d",
      "Given the number of injuries sustained by Arsenal players this season \u2014 others to have had long spells out include Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu \u2014 some have questioned whether Arteta\u2019s training methods are to blame.",
      "Maybe that was the reason why Arteta was eager to point out that Arsenal\u2019s players now \u201ctrain less than ever\u201d and go into a deeper explanation about how too many games \u2014 and, as a result, not enough training \u2014 affects players\u2019 recovery.",
      "\u201cThe muscle is undertrained and then you expose the muscle and the tendon to an exposure that they cannot absorb because the tendon needs 72 hours to recover,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cA lot of people talk about what we're doing outside. It\u2019s not outside, it\u2019s inside.",
      "\u201cWhen you have to load that muscle for two or three or six or eight weeks that you haven\u2019t in training, the risk of injury is much bigger \u2014 one, because the tendon is not recovered, and then it\u2019s not prepared to absorb the load and stress you are going to put it under every three days.\u201d",

      "Paris-based UFC-Que Choisir chose Valentine\u2019s Day to release results of what it said were tests of roses, gerberas and chrysanthemums sold at florists, shops, supermarkets and online. It said it found potentially harmful residues of pesticides in every bouquet.",

      "Unlike for produce that is consumed, regulations in Europe on cut flowers place no limits on the level of pesticides, UFC-Que Choisir notes.",
      "The group is calling on authorities to introduce maximum levels of pesticide residues, a ban on imports of flowers treated with pesticides that are banned in Europe, and mandatory labelling of the origin and treatment of flowers.",
      "The group bought 15 bouquets of flowers. In each one, between seven and up to 46 different pesticide residues were identified, of which an average of almost 12 were deemed hazardous because they are possibly carcinogenic or endocrine disrupting, the group said. Residues of pesticides banned in the EU were found in two-thirds of the bouquets.",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah students in as early as kindergarten would be required to learn about firearm safety in the classroom under a bill that passed the state House with overwhelming support Friday.",
      "The Republican-controlled chamber approved the measure in a 59-10 vote and sent it to the Senate, despite concerns from some gun violence prevention advocates that it places an unnecessary burden on children.",
      "Under the proposal, public school students would receive mandatory instruction throughout their K-12 years on how to respond if they encounter a gun. The lessons, which could be presented in a video or by an instructor displaying an actual firearm, would demonstrate best practices for safely handling and storing a gun to prevent accidents.",
      "Elementary age children would learn about gun safety on at least three occasions by the time they reach sixth grade, with the possibility for that instruction to begin in kindergarten, when kids are around five years old.",
      "The bill\u2019s Republican sponsor, Rep. Rex Shipp of Cedar City, said it's aimed at preventing accidental shootings by and of young children. The lessons, he said, will be age-appropriate for each grade level, with younger students learning to avoid touching a gun and alert an adult immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times when they don't have any firearms in their homes or don't do any hunting and shooting, then these kids are not taught what to do when they come in contact with a firearm,\u201d Shipp said.",
      "One other state, Tennessee, has a law on the books requiring firearm safety training in public schools, but it lets education officials determine in which grade they think it's appropriate for students to start receiving that instruction. The lessons, set to begin next school year, will be annual and cannot include live firearms or ammunition.",
      "A Utah statute already allows firearm safety to be taught in schools, but Shipp said teachers don't currently do so. His bill makes it mandatory but allows parents to opt their kids out of the instruction.",
      "If it passes the similarly Republican-led Senate and is signed into law, the lessons would begin next school year.",
      "Gun violence prevention advocates have applauded Utah Republicans for pushing for more gun safety education, but some argue those lessons should be aimed at adults.",
      "The proposal unfairly places the responsibility of gun safety on children rather than their parents, said Barbara Gentry of the Gun Violence Prevention Center of Utah.",

      "Lawmakers in Alabama's House have passed a bill expediting Medicaid for pregnant women in a state with one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country",
      "MONTOGMERY, Ala. -- A bill that would expedite Medicaid coverage and prenatal health care for low-income pregnant women in Alabama has advanced as lawmakers across the South try to address rising maternal and infant mortality rates.",
      "The \u201cpresumptive eligibility\u201d legislation states that Medicaid will pay for a pregnant woman\u2019s outpatient medical care for up to 60 days while her application for the government-funded insurance program is being considered.",
      "\u201cThis way we cut out some of the red tape, we get them in as quickly as possible,\u201d said Rep. Marilyn Lands, the Democrat representing Huntsville who introduced the bill.",
      "Processing Medicaid applications can take weeks, Lands said, and physicians say early prenatal care is vital.",
      "Last year, nearly 1 in 5 pregnant Alabama women received prenatal care after five months of pregnancy, or otherwise received less than 50% of the appropriate number of the recommended visits throughout her pregnancy, according to The March of Dimes.",
      "The bill passed in the Alabama House of Representatives unanimously. It will now be considered by the Senate. Republicans celebrated the bill as a \u201cpro-life\u201d measure.",
      "Alabama\u2019s delivery health outcomes currently lag far behind the rest of the country.",

      "Other states have adopted a similar strategy for addressing some of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates across the country. Legislators in both Mississippi and Arkansas have introduced bills that would offer similar coverage to expectant mothers. Mississippi passed a law last year that was nearly identical to the Alabama legislation, but it was never implemented after negotiations with the federal Medicaid agency stalled, according to Mississippi Today.",
      "Alabama and Mississippi are among 10 states nationwide that have not expanded Medicaid, which means many low-income women are only eligible for Medicaid once they become pregnant.",
      "In Alabama, 1 in 6 women of childbearing age fall within the coverage gap, making too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford private insurance, according to Alabama Arise, an advocacy group for low-income families.",
      "A pregnant woman in Alabama with no dependents can qualify for Medicaid if she makes $21,996 or less, or up to $37,704 if she is part of a household of three.",
      "Medicaid was used to pay for 45% of all births in Alabama in 2023, according to the most recent report published by the Alabama Department of Public Health. More than half of all infant deaths were to mothers who used Medicaid.",
      "Dr. Max Rogers, an obstetrician-gynecologist who works with many low-income pregnant women in rural communities, said medical care during the first trimester is essential for ensuring a woman is in a safe environment for carrying a pregnancy and identifying potentially lethal threats early on.",
      "\u201cThe longer you have to get blood pressure under control, or get diabetes under control, the long-term outcomes are going to be much, much better,\u201d Rogers said.",

He was able to relocate an hour and a half south where he has continued seeing some of his patients \u2014 but the closures have left huge swaths of women in the state without access to prenatal care.",
      "Rogers says he supports the bill but that it will only be effective if other measures are taken to increase access to care.",
      "\u201cIf we don't make sure that a patient can get there and take advantage of services, it doesn't really have an impact, right?\u201d he said."

      "Lawyers for South Carolina and Planned Parenthood are returning to the state\u2019s highest court to argue how restrictive the state's abortion ban should be",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- With a heartbeat abortion ban solidly in place in South Carolina, lawyers for the state and Planned Parenthood return to the state's highest court Wednesday to argue how restrictive the ban should be.",
      "The law is being enforced in South Carolina as a ban on almost all abortions around six weeks after conception, setting that mark as the time cardiac activity starts.",
      "But Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups are arguing the 2023 law includes alternative definitions about the timing of a fetal heart forming and a \u201cheartbeat\u201d starting and the true ban should start around nine or 10 weeks.",
      "Both sides are set to argue for just over an hour at the South Carolina Supreme Court in Columbia. The justices likely will take several months to decide the case. In the meantime, the abortion ban around six weeks likely will remain in place after a lower court upheld it.",
      "The 2023 law says abortions cannot be performed after an ultrasound can detect \u201ccardiac activity, or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201d",
      "South Carolina and several other states place that at six weeks into development. But what follows the \u201cor\u201d in the sentence could require that a heart has formed, and medical experts say that doesn\u2019t happen until around nine weeks.",
      "The legal fight has been brewing since the state Supreme Court reversed itself after overturning a similar ban in 2021. The Republican-dominated General Assembly then made small changes and a justice who voted in the majority in the 3-2 decision to overturn the ban reached retirement age and was replaced.",
      "In the decision upholding the new ban, the state Supreme Court itself noted the different definitions saying resolving them would be a question \u201cfor another day.\u201d",
      "That day is Wednesday. Since then, more inconsistencies in the law\u2019s language have been brought up. The law refers to a fetal heartbeat, but most experts consider a fertilized egg to be an embryo for about 10 weeks after conception before transitioning into a fetus.",
      "Lawyers for the state said the parsing of the language ignores the intent of the Legislature. Both supporters and opponents of the bill called it nearly exclusively a six-week ban during debate in the House and Senate.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion, most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions and most Democrat-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and South Carolina and three others have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy -- often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The latest lawsuit was filed by South Carolina resident Taylor Shelton, who said she had sought medical attention for pain from her intrauterine device and was stunned to find out, just two days after missing her regularly-tracked period, that she was pregnant.",
      "She ended up in North Carolina, driving for hours to several appointments to undergo an abortion because doctors in South Carolina were unsure how to define a heartbeat. Shelton couldn\u2019t be completely sure she was within six weeks.",
      "Some Republicans in South Carolina are also pushing for an outright abortion ban, but while legislation was introduced this January when the General Assembly started its two-year session, no hearings have been held."

      "A new study suggests that medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol",
      "Medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol, according to new government-funded research.",
      "The study was small \u2014 just 48 adults \u2014 and lasted just over two months, so it\u2019s not the final word. Experts say it\u2019s not yet clear how safe these drugs are for people who don\u2019t need to lose weight.",
      "But the results add to evidence from animal studies and reports that people are finding drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy helpful to manage cravings, not just for food, but also for tobacco and alcohol. Scientists are studying these drugs in smokers, people with opioid addiction and cocaine users.",
      "\u201cThis is such promising data. And we need more of it,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Klara Klein, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who treats patients with diabetes and obesity. \u201cWe frequently will hear that once people start these medications that their desire to drink is very reduced, if not completely abolished.\"",
      "The drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. The new study looked at one of these drugs, semaglutide, which is the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy.",
      "The research, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "There are already three medications approved to treat alcohol use disorder, so until larger studies can confirm the findings, people should talk to their doctor about what's already available, said lead author Christian Hendershot, an addiction researcher at University of Southern California.",
      "For the new study, researchers recruited people who reported symptoms of alcohol use disorder, such as difficulty controlling their drinking, but weren\u2019t actively seeking treatment for it.",
      "First, each person came to a lab where they were served their favorite alcoholic beverage and could drink as much as they wanted over two hours.",
      "Then, researchers randomly assigned half the people to get a weekly injection of semaglutide. The other half got sham injections.",
      "For nine weeks, everyone kept track of their drinking habits and their desire for alcohol. A lab visit with their favorite alcohol was repeated at the end of the study.",
      "During the last weeks of the study, nearly 40% in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days compared with 20% in the placebo group. And in the final lab test, the semaglutide group drank roughly half the amount, on average, compared to those who got the placebo.",
      "Everyone in the study was overweight. It's unclear how safe the drugs would be for a person of normal weight, Klein said.",
      "Smokers in the study who got the semaglutide also cut back on cigarettes, noted Luba Yammine of UTHealth Houston, who is leading other research on GLP-1 drugs for people who want to quit smoking. The finding is promising but more data is needed, Yammine said.",
      "The study \u201cprovides additional important information on the potential role of this new class of medications\u201d in treating certain addictions, said Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, an NIH researcher who is leading a 20-week trial of semaglutide for alcohol use disorder now underway in Baltimore.",
      "\u201cIt is important to keep in mind that we need larger randomized clinical trials to confirm these findings,\u201d Leggio said.",

      "Lawmakers in some states are pushing measures to crack down on abortion pills or penalize women who obtain abortions",
      "Lawmakers in some states where abortion is already banned are seeking to explicitly bar abortion pills or take a step that most leading anti-abortion groups oppose: punish women who seek to end their pregnancies.",
      "It's too early in some legislative sessions to know whether the measures will get serious consideration. But it does show that the policy debate continues to evolve following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans on abortion.",
      "Here's a look at where things stand:",
      "Lawmakers in several states have introduced measures to classify the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 which are used together in the majority of U.S. abortions \u2014 as controlled dangerous substances, making it a crime to possess them without prescriptions.",
      "Louisiana last year became the first state to adopt such a law, despite concerns from doctors who contended that the restrictions would make it harder for them to access the drugs to perform life-saving procedures.",
      "The measures have been introduced in states where Republicans control the government and where there are bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions.",
      "The legislation has died or appears unlikely to advance in Indiana and Mississippi.",
      "Elsewhere \u2014 including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas \u2014 it's too early to know whether they have a chance.",
      "In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch opponent of abortion, has vowed to sign any anti-abortion measure that comes to his desk.",
      "And one scholar who follows abortion policy said that the bills can affect the debate even if they don't pick up momentum.",
      "\u201cThe more often that they\u2019re introduced, the more normalized these sorts of bills and these sorts of concepts that they\u2019re pushing become,\u201d said Laura Hermer, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota.",
      "Authorities in two states with stringent abortion laws have targeted a New York doctor for allegedly sending abortion pills to patients in those states.",
      "Last month, a Louisiana grand jury indicted Dr. Maggie Carpenter on charges of criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Carpenter in civil court under similar circumstances.",
      "The legal actions set up a test of laws in some Democratic-controlled states, including New York, that seek to protect health care providers who use telehealth to prescribe and then mail abortion pills to patients in states where they're banned. New York officials say they will not extradite the doctor to Louisiana.",
      "Since Carpenter's indictment, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a law that allows doctors to leave their names off prescription bottles for abortion pills as a way to further insulate them. Similar legislation has been introduced in Maine.",
      "The attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are also suing in federal court to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone and bar prescriptions for it by telehealth.",
      "Some advocates are calling on President Donald Trump to enforce an 1873 law to ban mailing medication or instruments used in abortion, but he has not done so.",
      "While critics say the drugs are unsafe, some major medical groups disagree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is decades of evidence that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective. The group cited a study showing that major adverse events such as significant infection and excessive blood loss occur in less than 0.32% of patients taking mifepristone for a medication abortion. Medical organizations say mifepristone\u2019s safety compares to that of the over-the-counter pain medication ibuprofen.",
      "Bills in several states would open the door to criminal charges against women who seek or obtain abortions on charges including murder.",
      "That's a step no state has taken so far, and which leading anti-abortion groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and the National Right to Life Committee oppose.",
      "Still, such bills have been introduced in Idaho and Indiana, where they're unlikely to advance, and Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Carolina, where they're all early in the legislative process.",
      "Reached by phone, South Carolina Rep. Luke Rankin, a Republican who added his name to a list of bill sponsors last week, said, \u201cI've always been pro-life.\u201d When asked about the provision to allow prosecution of women seeking abortion, he said: \u201cI can't help you there\u201d and declined to answer questions.",

      "The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on the confirmation of Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent lawyer and vocal vaccine critic, as the nation's health secretary, controlling $1.7 trillion in spending for vaccines, food safety and health insurance programs for roughly half the country.",
      "Despite several Republicans expressing deep skepticism about his views on vaccines, Kennedy is expected to win confirmation, absent any last-minute changes.",
      "Kennedy, 71, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has earned a formidable following with his populist \u2014 and sometimes extreme \u2014 views on food, chemicals and vaccines.",
      "His audience only grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kennedy devoted much of his time to a nonprofit that sued vaccine makers and harnessed social media campaigns to erode trust in vaccines as well as the government agencies that promote them.",
      "With the backing of Republican President Donald Trump, Kennedy believes he is \u201cuniquely positioned\u201d to revive trust in those public health agencies, which include the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes for Health.",
      "Republican senators have largely embraced Kennedy's vision, reciting his newly hatched slogan to \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d in speeches.",
      "Last week, North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis said he hopes Kennedy \u201cgoes wild\u201d on reigning in health care costs and improving Americans' health. But one holdout \u2014 GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana doctor \u2014 required assurances that Kennedy would not make changes to existing vaccine recommendations before agreeing to back him.",
      "Democrats have remained skeptical, unsuccessfully prodding Kennedy during hearings to deny a long discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. And some have raised alarms about Kennedy financially benefiting from changing vaccine guidelines or weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers.",
      "Kennedy made more than $850,000 last year from an arrangement referring clients to a law firm that has sued the makers of Gardasil, a human papillomavirus vaccine that protects against cervical cancer. While serving as health secretary, he has promised to reroute fees collected from the arrangement to his son.",
      "Kennedy is expected to take over the agency in the midst of a massive federal government shakeup, led by billionaire Elon Musk, that has shut off \u2014 even if temporarily \u2014 billions of taxpayer dollars in public health funding and left thousands of federal workers unsure about their jobs.",
      "On Friday, the NIH announced it would cap billions of dollars in medical research given to universities and cancer being used to develop treatments for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.",
      "Kennedy, too, has called for a staffing overhaul at the NIH, FDA and CDC. Last year, he vowed to fire 600 employees at the NIH, the nation's largest funder of biomedical research."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's abrupt freeze in foreign aid has closed health clinics offering free care in one of Syria's most vulnerable regions",
      "SARMADA, Syria -- In the town of Sarmada in northern Syria, Dr. Mohammad Fares unlocked a clinic that once bustled with patients. Now it's empty, and shelves of medicine reduced to a few boxes of bandages and expired drugs.",
      "This is what it looks like after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month. The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, issued stop-work orders during a 90-day review for what the administration has alleged is wasteful spending.",
      "Fares had been working in three clinics run by M\u00e9decins du Monde, or Doctors of the World, offering free health care to the displaced population in northern Syria, which until the fall of former President Bashar Assad in December had been the country's main rebel-held enclave. It sheltered millions of people who had fled years of civil war.",
      "Their already grim camps swelled again in 2023 after a deadly magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit Turkey and northern Syria. Since the fall of Assad, some displaced Syrians have begun to return home, but many have no homes left.",
      "Fares\u2019 clinic in Sarmada used to support 16 camps in the region, assisting approximately 35,000 people. Since the aid freeze, 10 such clinics receiving USAID funding had to close, and Doctors of the World had to lay off 184 people, officials with the organization said.",
      "\u201cIf the support is not resumed, there will be a major disaster and serious harm to vulnerable groups,\u201d said Fares, who heads the organization\u2019s medical programs. \u201cOperating costs of clinics are much lower than those of hospitals. The cessation of work in these clinics will put increased pressure on emergency hospitals and other healthcare facilities\"",
      "This part of Syria lacks centralized government healthcare, leaving people reliant on nonprofit providers and making the impact of the sudden U.S. cuts especially dire, aid workers and experts said.",
      "\"Our analysis shows that withdrawing all of USAID\u2019s support in Syria would be equivalent to a devastating shock of 5% to its already struggling economy. This is among the largest impacts on any recipient.\" said Ian Mitchell, senior policy fellow at the Washington based Center for Global Development.",
      "The U.S. had been providing 25 cents in foreign aid for every $100 of U.S. income, Mitchell said, but that relatively small contribution had outsized impact: \u201cWithout U.S. support in places like Gaza and Syria, the world will become a more dangerous place.\"",
      "In one camp that had been served by a Doctors of the World clinic, near Kawkaba village, children played among the crowded tents.",
      "Camp director Abdelkareem Khaled said the suspension of aid has exacerbated already difficult conditions.",
      "\u201cPatients, especially those who need medicine every month, can no longer afford it at the pharmacy,\u201d he said, leaving those with chronic diseases like diabetes with wrenching decisions to make.",
      "In one tent, Bassam Hussein, father of 4 daughters. said he was forced to pull his 12-year-old daughter out of school so she could work in an almond field to help pay for the medicine he uses for his thyroid illness.",
      "\u201cEvery twenty days, I need a pack of medicine that costs $12,\u201d he said, \"If I don\u2019t secure the cost of the medicine, I experience complications \u2014 weakness, depression and so on.\u201d He said he was unable to work because of past injuries and illnesses.",
      "Other organizations are in limbo. Some have continued providing services without knowing where they will find the money.",
      "Dr. Mufaddal Hamadeh, president of the Syrian American Medical Society, which runs hospitals and mobile clinics across the north, said some services had to continue, such as the maternity ward and incubators. But it's unclear how long that will remain sustainable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not certain if we\u2019ll get a waiver or reimbursement for the expenses we\u2019ve already covered,\" he said, referring to the U.S. government. \u201dThat already put a huge financial burden on us.\u201d He refused to give details.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has issued a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs. But Hamadeh and others said funding has not resumed to a point that would allow them to fully restore services.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to shut down some of these hospitals and shrink,\u201d Hamadeh said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be providing free services anymore.\"",
      "Some programs, such as mental health support for refugees in Turkey and an autism center for children, may not be deemed life-saving.",
      "\u201cWe have a grant that supports survivors of torture and sexual assault,\u201d Hamadeh said. \u201cAre these services life-saving or not? Likely they will be shut down.\u201d",
      "USAID and the U.S. government did not respond to questions. Elsewhere, USAID workers and aid officials have said funding hasn't resumed despite waivers, or USAID staffers who would process them are now gone.",
      "SAMS relies on USAID for about 25 to 30% of its funds. It's significant, but some other organizations working in Syria receive much more.",
      "Doctors of the World's Istanbul office, which oversees operations in northern Syria, was receiving 60% of its funding from USAID.",
      "Sitting in a new, downsized office, Turkish branch director Hakan Bilgin recalled the day they were told to halt services.",
      "\u201cWe just received the stop-work order suddenly. Nobody was expecting it,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a medical organization providing life-saving services, you\u2019re basically telling us: Close all the clinics, stop all your doctors, and you\u2019re not providing services to women, children, and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Bilgin said his group has cut its daily consultations across northern Syria from 5,000 to 500. The organization has applied for a waiver from the U.S. but has received no response.",
      "Trump and Elon Musk, who runs what is billed as a cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, have taken aim at various government agencies. But USAID has been hit the hardest, with Trump and Musk accusing the agency\u2019s work of being out of line with Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "Hamadeh, the SAMS president, said the aid cuts are short-sighted and could harm Washington's standing abroad.",
      "\u201cThis money is helping people, saving lives,\" he said. \"You can\u2019t just shut down USAID, which has helped millions across the world and actually did help improve America\u2019s reputation.\u201d",
      "Northwest Syria has been devastated by years of war and neglect, he said. \u201cPulling the plug over that will just increase the suffering.\u201d",

      "The ruling was handed down on the same day New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected a request from Louisiana to extradite the same doctor, Dr. Maggie Carpenter, who was charged in that state with prescribing abortion pills to a pregnant minor.",
      "Unlike Louisiana, Texas did not file criminal charges against Carpenter but accused her in a December lawsuit of violating state law by prescribing abortion medication via telemedicine. Texas has one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the nation.",
      "State District Judge Bryan Gantt issued a $100,000 fine against Carpenter and ordered her to pay attorney\u2019s fees.",
      "Earlier Hochul, a Democrat, said she will not honor Louisiana's request to arrest and send the doctor to Louisiana after she was charged with violating the southern state's strict anti-abortion law.",

      "The case against Carpenter appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to another state.",
      "Pills have become the most common method of abortion in the U.S. and are at the epicenter of political and legal fights over abortion access following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.",

      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

    "summary": "A generation has passed since the peak in AIDS-related deaths",
    "story": [
      "A generation has passed since the peak in AIDS-related deaths",
      "A generation has passed since the world saw the peak in AIDS-related deaths. Those deaths \u2014 agonizing, from diseases the body might otherwise fight off \u2014 sent loved ones into the streets, pressuring governments to act. The United States eventually did, creating PEPFAR, arguably the most successful foreign aid program in history. HIV, which causes AIDS, is now manageable, though there is still no cure.",
      "Now the Trump administration has put the brakes on foreign aid while alleging it's wasteful, causing chaos in the system that for over 20 years has kept millions of people alive. Confusion over a temporary waiver for PEPFAR \u2014 and the difficulty of restarting its work, with U.S. workers, contractors and payments in upheaval \u2014 means the clock is ticking for many who are suddenly unable to obtain medications to keep AIDS at bay.",
      "The U.S.-led global response to HIV has been so effective that AIDS wards of people wasting away are a vision of the past. Now health experts, patients and others fear those days could return if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t reverse course or no other global power steps into the void, and fast.",
      "\u201cIn the next five years, we could have 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths,\u201d the U.N. AIDS agency told The Associated Press. That's a shock at a time of rising complacency around HIV, declining condom use among some young people and the rise of a medication that some believe could end AIDS for good.",
      "The agency has begun publicly tracking new HIV infections since the aid freeze.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what happens to the body when HIV drugs are stopped:",
      "HIV is spread by bodily fluids such as blood, breast milk or semen. It gradually weakens the body\u2019s immune system and makes it vulnerable to disease, including ones rarely seen in otherwise healthy people. The surprising emergence of such cases in the 1980s is what tipped off health experts to what became known as the AIDS epidemic.",
      "Years of intense advocacy and shocking sights of children, young adults and others dying of pneumonia and other infections led to the response that created PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Twenty million people around the world died before the program was founded. Now millions of people take drugs known as antivirals that keep HIV from spreading in the body.",
      "Stopping those drugs lets the virus start multiplying in the body again, and it could become drug-resistant. HIV can rebound to detectable levels in people\u2019s blood in just a few weeks, putting sexual partners at risk. Babies born to mothers with HIV can escape infection only if the woman was properly treated during pregnancy or the infant is treated immediately after birth.",
      "If the drugs are not taken, a body is heading toward AIDS, the final stage of infection.",
      "\u201cWithout HIV treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about three years,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "For a long time, there may be no noticeable symptoms. But a person can easily spread HIV to others, and the immune system becomes vulnerable to what are called opportunistic diseases.",
      "The National Institutes of Health says opportunistic diseases include fungal infections, pneumonia, salmonella and tuberculosis. For a country like South Africa, with the world\u2019s highest number of HIV cases and one of the largest numbers of TB cases, the toll could be immense.",
      "Unchecked by HIV treatment, the damage continues. The immune system is increasingly unable to fight off diseases. Every action, from eating to travel, must consider the potential exposure to germs.",
      "For years, the importance of taking the drugs every day, even at the same time of day, has been emphasized to people with HIV. Now the ability to follow that essential rule has been shaken.",
      "Already, hundreds or thousands of U.S.-funded health partners in countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia have been laid off, causing widespread gaps in HIV testing, messaging, care and support on the continent most helped by PEPFAR. At some African clinics, people with HIV have been turned away.",
      "Restoring the effects caused by the Trump administration's foreign aid freeze during a 90-day review period, and understanding what\u2019s allowed under the waiver for PEPFAR, will take time that health experts say many people don't have.",
      "Meanwhile, the head of the U.N. AIDS agency, Winnie Byanyima, told the AP that more resistant strains of the disease could emerge.",
      "And an additional 3.4 million children could be made orphans \u2014 another echo of the time when the world raced to confront AIDS with few tools at hand.",

      "MUNICH -- Finland's president on Sunday urged the rearming of Ukraine and putting \u201cmaximum pressure on Russia\u201d through sanctions and asset freezes in the run-up to possible negotiations sought by the U.S. on ending the war.",
      "Alexander Stubb and other European leaders at the final day of the Munich Security Conference on Sunday sought to firm up how the European Union can move from talk to more action and stay relevant as Washington pushes to stop the fighting. He laid out three phases: \u201cpre-negotiation,\u201d ceasefire and long-term peace negotiation.",
      "\u201cThe first phase is the pre-negotiation, and this is a moment when we need to rearm Ukraine and put maximum pressure on Russia, which means sanctions, which means frozen assets, so that Ukraine begins these negotiations from a position of strength,\" he said.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump's push for a quick way out of the Ukraine war has stirred concern and uncertainty in Munich. After a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, Trump said he and Putin would likely meet soon to negotiate a peace deal over Ukraine. Trump later assured Zelenskyy he also would have a seat at the table. U.S. officials have indicated that European nations, however, would not be involved.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate Trump as a negotiator, I genuinely believe that Putin is baffled and afraid what might be coming from there,\" Stubb said. \"Right now, the ball is in our court here in Europe. We need to convince the Americans where\u2019s the value added, and then get back into the table.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think in Europe we need to talk less and do more,\u201d he added later.",
      "President Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds of Latvia, which like Finland borders Russia, agreed that \u201cif we are strong, if we have something to offer ... then we are going to be interesting to the United States. If you are just continue having those nice conferences, talking and whining, then we are not going to be interesting to our own publics very soon.\u201d",
      "The three-day conference was a hub of crisscrossing diplomacy on issues of politics, economics, and defense and security, with top envoys on hand from places as diverse as Syria and Saudi Arabia, and Japan and South Korea, as well as many European leaders.",
      "On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for the creation of an \u201c armed forces of Europe \" to better stand up to an expansionist Russia that could threaten the European Union, too.",
      "He also said he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on U.S. interests.",
      "The proposal was a key part of his talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of the Munich event, according to one current and one former senior Ukrainian official familiar with the talks. Zelenskyy\u2019s decision not to sign a deal, at least for now, was described as \u201cshort-sighted\u201d by a senior White House official.",
      "Also Saturday, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya told reporters in Munich that he has asked U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to exclude Japan from steel and aluminum tariffs as well as from reciprocal tariff measures.",
      "Iwaya, who had a brief chat with the top U.S. diplomat on the sidelines of the conference, said he also \u201craised the issue\u201d of auto tariffs, though he gave no further details. If imposed, the impact of auto tariffs on the Japanese auto industry would be huge, experts say.",

      "Residents began placing candles at the site of the attack in the city of about 60,000 inhabitants. A group of young people, who knew the boy who died in Saturday's attack, gathered at the crime scene on Sunday morning to mourn and tearfully light candles, local media reported.",
      "The 23-year-old suspect, who was detained shortly after the stabbing, is a Syrian with a residence permit in Austria. A 42-year-old man, also a Syrian working for a food delivery company, witnessed the attack from his car.

This is a first-class failure of the system, for which a young man in Villach has now had to pay with his life,\u201d Kickl said.",
      "\u201cFrom Austria to the EU \u2014 the wrong rules are in force everywhere. Nobody is allowed to challenge them, everything is declared sacrosanct,\u201d he said, adding that his party had outlined what he viewed as necessary changes to immigration laws in its election platform.",

      "Ivanov, who joined the mass protests that erupted across Russia in 2017, said that since Navalny's death, \"I\u2019m afraid that there is no one left who could somehow resist\u201d the Kremlin.",
      "Navalny is the second opposition leader whose sudden death shocked Russia and the world. In February 2015, prominent politician Boris Nemtsov was gunned down on a bridge near the Kremlin just days before he, Navalny and others were expected to lead a mass anti-Putin rally.",
      "Navalny\u2019s vision of a \u201cbeautiful Russia of the future,\u201d where leaders are freely and fairly elected, corruption is tamed, and democratic institutions work, earned him widespread support in the vast country.",
      "His charisma and sardonic humor drew young, energetic activists to his side \u2014 a team that resembled \u201ca fancy startup\u201d rather than a clandestine revolutionary operation, according to his memoir, \u201cPatriot,\u201d released eight months after his death.",
      "Together they created colorful, professionally produced videos exposing corruption by government officials. Millions viewed them on YouTube and tens of thousands attended rallies even as authorities cracked down harder on dissent.",
      "As Navalny aspired to public office, authorities responded by bringing multiple criminal charges against him, his allies and even relatives. Regularly jailed, he was physically attacked by Kremlin supporters, one of whom threw green dye in his face that nearly cost him the vision in one eye.",
      "He finished second in the race for Moscow mayor in 2013 amid allegations of vote rigging. In 2017, he announced plans to run for president and set up a sprawling network of regional offices across the country, recruiting local activists. When he was eventually barred from running, he kept those offices open, extending his reach across Russia\u2019s 11 time zones.",
      "In 2020, Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent attack he blamed on the Kremlin, which always denied involvement. His family and allies fought to have him flown to Germany for treatment and recovery. Five months later, he returned to Russia, where he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the last three years of his life.",
      "But even behind bars, in incredibly harsh conditions of constant pressure and surveillance, Navalny found a way to relay messages. His popular social media accounts were regularly updated with sarcastic vignettes about prison life and political statements.",
      "Authorities blamed Navalny's death, announced Feb. 16, 2024, on natural causes \u2014 a sudden spike in blood pressure and chronic diseases. His family and allies reject that and insist he was killed on orders from the Kremlin \u2014 accusations its officials deny.",
      "Tens of thousands of people attended his funeral in Moscow on March 1 in a rare show of defiance in a country where any street rally or even single pickets often result in immediate arrest. For days afterward, people brought flowers to his grave.",

      "BUKAVU, Congo -- Rwanda-backed rebels reached the center of east Congo\u2019s second largest city, Bukavu, on Sunday morning and took control of the South Kivu province administrative office after little resistance from government forces, many of whom fled the rebels' advance.",
      "Associated Press journalists witnessed scores of residents cheering on the M23 rebels in central Bukavu on Sunday morning as they walked and drove around the city center after a dayslong march from the region's major city of Goma 63 miles (101 kilometers) away, which they captured late last month. Several parts of the city, however, remained deserted with residents indoors.",
      "The M23 rebels are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, and are supported by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to the U.N.",
      "It was not clear if the rebels had taken decisive control of the city of about 1.3 million people. Their presence in central Bukavu is an unprecedented expansion of the rebels' reach in their yearslong fighting with Congolese forces. Unlike in 2012 when they only seized Goma in the fighting connected to ethnic tension, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power.",
      "Many Congolese soldiers were seen on Saturday fleeing the rebels\u2019 advance into Bukavu alongside thousands of civilians amid widespread looting and panic.",
      "Congo\u2019s President Felix Tshisekedi held a security meeting in the faraway capital of Kinshasa, where officials noted that Bukavu was \u201cbriefly\u201d invaded by M23 but remains under the control of the Congolese army and allies from local militia, the presidency said on X. There were no signs of fighting or of Congolese forces in most parts of Bukavu on Sunday.",
      "Tshisekedi has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict. Congo's forces are being supported in Bukavu by troops from Burundi and in Goma by troops from South Africa.",
      "Burundi's president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest his country will not retaliate in the fighting. In a post on X he said that \u201cthose people who were ready to get profit of the armed attack of Rwanda to Burundi will not see this.\u201d",
      "The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, said it was committed to \u201cdefending the people of Bukavu\u201d in a Saturday statement that did not acknowledge their presence in the city. \u201cWe call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,\u201d Lawrence Kanyuka, the alliance\u2019s spokesperson, said in a statement.",
      "The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda says the group is \u201cfully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges."

      "BAMAKO, Mali -- A gold mine collapsed in eastern Mali, killing dozens of people and injuring many more, according to Malian television and officials in the K\u00e9ni\u00e9ba district where the accident occurred. It is the second major accident this year in the French-speaking West African country, which is one of Africa\u2019s top three gold producers.",
      "Late on Saturday, Malian television announced the collapse of the site at Bilali Koto in the commune of Dabia, with a provisional death toll of 42 and many injured.",
      "The prefect of K\u00e9ni\u00e9ba, who represents the government in the locality, confirmed the incident. \u201cThe death toll of 42 should be definitive,\u201d Mohamed Dicko told The Associated Press on Sunday.",
      "\u201cThe accident happened yesterday, Saturday. It was a landslide at a site run by Chinese nationals,\u201d said community leader Falaye Sissoko. Dicko said authorities were still trying to establish whether the mine was operating legally.",
      "This is the second time in less than a month that such an accident has occurred in Mali. On Jan. 29, a landslide killed several gold miners, mostly women, in the Koulikoro region in the south of the country.",
      "In January last year, an unregulated gold mine collapsed near the capital, Bamako, killing more than 70 people.",
      "In recent years, there have been concerns that profits from unregulated mining in northern Mali could benefit extremists active in that part of the country.",

      "Ukraine boasts vast reserves of ilmenite, a key element used to produce titanium, in the heavy mineral sands that stretch for miles along the country\u2019s embattled east",
      "KIROVOHRAD REGION, Ukraine -- The mineral ilmenite is extracted from mounds of sand deep in the earth and refined using a method that summons the force of gravity, resulting in a substance that glimmers like a moonlit sky.",
      "Ukraine boasts vast reserves of ilmenite \u2014 a key element used to produce titanium \u2014 in the heavy mineral sands that stretch for miles along the country\u2019s embattled east.",
      "Much of it, as with all of Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals industry, is underdeveloped because of war as well as onerous state policies.",
      "That is poised to change if U.S. President Donald Trump's administration agrees to a deal with Ukraine to exchange critical minerals for continued American military aid.",
      "In the central region of Kirovohrad, the ilmenite open-pit mine is a canyon of precious deposits that its owner is keen to develop with U.S. companies. But many unknowns stand in the way of turning these riches into profit: cost, licensing terms and whether such a deal will be underpinned by security guarantees.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday at the Munich Security Conference that he did not permit his ministers to sign a mineral resource agreement with the U.S. because the current version is not \u201cready to protect us, our interests.\"",
      "Ukrainian businessmen with knowledge of the minerals industry also privately expressed skepticism about whether a deal is viable. The capital-intensive industry is unlikely to yield results in years, if not decades, as geological data is either limited or classified. Many question what conditions American companies are willing to risk to build up the industry and whether existing Ukrainian policies that have so far deterred local businessmen will accommodate foreign investors.",
      "\u201cThe main thing we can gain is certain security guarantees obtained through economic means, so that someone stronger than us has an interest in protecting us,\u201d said Andriy Brodsky, CEO of Velta, a leading titanium mining company in Ukraine.",
      "A deal, which would essentially barter one resource for another, could help strengthen Kyiv\u2019s relationship with the Trump administration.",
      "The United States is a major consumer of critical raw earth minerals such as lithium and gallium, two elements that Ukraine has in proven reserves. Trump has specifically mentioned rare earth elements, but these are not well researched, industry experts told The Associated Press.",
      "Titanium, used in aerospace, defense and industry, is also high in demand and the U.S. is a leading importer of ilmenite. Sourcing the minerals from Ukraine would reduce future reliance on Russia and China.",
      "In exchange, Kyiv would continue to receive a steady stream of American weaponry that offers leverage against Moscow and without which Ukraine cannot ward off future Russian aggression in the event of a ceasefire.",
      "The question of security guarantees is a sticking point for companies, Ukrainian businessmen and analysts said. A senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously to describe private conversations, told the AP that U.S. companies expressed interest in investing but needed to ensure their billions will be safeguarded in the event of renewed conflict. But once invested in Ukraine, the presence of American business interests alone might act as a guarantee, Brodsky said.",
      "\u201cIf this process starts, it will continue,\u201d Brodsky said. \u201cOnce the investment figures exceed hundreds of billions, the Americans, a highly pragmatic people, will protect their profits earned on Ukrainian soil. They will defend their interests against Russia, China, Korea, Iran and anyone else. They will protect what they consider theirs.\u201d",
      "Brodsky, who just returned from a trip to Washington and New York, said the conversation among U.S. businesses is changing in Kyiv\u2019s favor.",
      "\u201cA lot of people in very serious and wealthy offices are saying that now, we \u2014 our country and my company \u2014 are in the right place and doing exactly what needs to be done at this moment,\u201d he said.",
      "Velta has worked with American partners for many years. Brodsky has begun negotiating with companies he believes could be a partner in the event of a deal.",
      "Ukraine has never been attractive to foreign investors because of prohibitive government policies \u2014 not offering incentives to attract foreigners, for instance. Brodsky believes that international companies will need to pair up with local partners to flourish.",
      "American companies have several ways to enter the market, explained Ksenia Orynchak, director of the National Association of Extractive Industries of Ukraine, but would require traversing \u201ccertain circles of hell\u201d in Ukraine's bureaucracy. Teaming up with an existing Ukrainian license owner is possibly the most straightforward.",
      "She said more exploration is needed in the field and hinted existing data may have been acquired through ulterior motives. Under the Soviet system, geologists stood to gain if they claimed to have found large reserves.",
      "\u201cSomeone did it so that Moscow would praise Ukrainian geologists or Soviet geologists,\u201d she said.",
      "She advises American investors to lower existing thresholds for exploration because bidding can take place in areas where reserves are only presumed, not proven.",
      "\u201cI believe, and so does the expert community, that this is not right. In fact, we are selling a pig in a poke,\u201d she said.",
      "At the extraction site, the air is dense with ilmenite dust. When the afternoon sun\u2019s rays pierce the darkened space, they sparkle and dance in the air. The soot covers the faces of workers who spend hours inside every day extracting the precious material from sand.",
      "The gravity separation method removes unwanted elements in the ore and water separated from the mineral rains down through metal-lined floors. Workers are used to getting wet and don\u2019t bat an eye. Titanium is developed from the purified ilmenite at a different facility.",
      "Velta began in the form of an expired license for geological exploration and a business plan for $7 million when Brodsky acquired the company. It would be eight years and many millions more invested before he could even think about production capacity.",
      "The deal also does not factor in a crucial element that could prove challenging later: The position of Ukrainian people themselves. According to the Constitution, the subsoil where extraction would take place belongs to Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI am very afraid that they (Ukrainian people) already had disapproving reviews, that everything is being given away. Who allowed him? He had no right? And so on,\u201d Orynchak said.",
      "Those sensitivities were echoed among workers at the Velta mine. Speaking anonymously to voice his true thoughts, one said: \u201cIf you have a vegetable garden in your home, do you invite a foreigner to take it?\u201d",
      "The high risk often is a key reason that some Ukrainian businessmen privately express skepticism about the deal.",
      "When one businessman of a major group of companies heard about the arms-for-minerals deal, his first impression was: \u201cThis is just hot air,\u201d he said, speaking on condition of anonymity to speak freely about his thoughts. \u201cThis is a very capital intensive industry. Just to take ground from an open pit will cost you billions. Not millions, billions.\u201d",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is kicking of a Mideast tour in Israel on Sunday",
      "JERUSALEM -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio is kicking of a Mideast tour in Israel on Sunday as Arab leaders reel from President Donald Trump's proposal to transfer the Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip to other countries and redevelop it under U.S. ownership.",
      "On Rubio's first visit to the region as America's top diplomat he is likely to get a warm welcome from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has praised the plan, and pushback from Arab leaders, who have universally rejected it and are scrambling to come up with a counterproposal.",
      "The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas meanwhile remains intact after a major dispute threatened to unravel it last week. But the sides face a fast-approaching deadline in early March to negotiate the next phase, and the war may resume if they don't reach an agreement.",
      "The Israeli military said it carried out an airstrike early Sunday on people who approached its forces in southern Gaza. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its policemen while they were providing security for the entry of aid trucks near Rafah, on the Egyptian border.",
      "Netanyahu has signaled readiness to resume the war after the current stage, even if that would leave dozens of hostages in captivity. At the same time, he has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top leaders into exile. Hamas has rejected such a scenario.",
      "Israel's Kan public broadcaster reported that Netanyahu has not approved the entry of mobile homes and heavy machinery into the Gaza Strip, as required by the ceasefire agreement. Hamas had threatened to hold up the release of hostages last week over the issue, raising fears the ceasefire could unravel, before proceeding with the release based on what it said were assurances from Arab mediators.",
      "An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said the issue would be discussed in the coming days and that Israel was coordinating with the United States.",
      "Israel's Defense Ministry meanwhile said Sunday it received a shipment of 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) MK-84 munitions from the United States. The Biden administration had paused a shipment of such bombs last year over concerns about civilian casualties in Gaza.",
      "In a radio interview last week, Rubio indicated that Trump's proposal was in part aimed at pressuring Arab states to come up with their own postwar plan that would be acceptable to Israel, which says Hamas can have no role in Gaza.",
      "He also appeared to suggest that Arab countries send in troops to combat Hamas, which survived Israel's devastating 15-month onslaught and remains in firm control of the territory.",
      "\u201cIf someone has a better plan, and we hope they do, if the Arab countries have a better plan, then that\u2019s great,\u201d Rubio said Thursday on the \u201cClay and Buck Show.\u201d",
      "But \u201cHamas has guns,\u201d he added. \u201cSomeone has to confront those guys. It\u2019s not going to be American soldiers. And if the countries in the region can\u2019t figure that piece out, then Israel is going to have to do it and then we\u2019re back to where we\u2019ve been.\u201d",
      "It was not clear if Rubio would meet with any Palestinians.",
      "For Arab leaders, facilitating the mass expulsion of Palestinians or battling Palestinian militants on behalf of Israel are both nightmare scenarios. Either would open them up to fierce domestic criticism and potentially destabilize an already volatile region.",
      "Egypt says it will host an Arab summit on Feb. 27 and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population, which human rights groups say would likely violate international law.",
      "Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region.",
      "Arab and Muslim countries have until now conditioned any support for postwar Gaza on a return to Palestinian governance with a pathway to statehood in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "The Biden administration spent months rallying regional powers behind such plans, but they fizzled as Israel ruled out not only a Palestinian state but also any role in Gaza for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, whose forces were driven out when Hamas seized power there in 2007.",
      "Last year, Egypt proposed that a committee of independent technocrats under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority take charge of governing and rebuilding Gaza. Hamas accepted the proposal but its secular rival, Fatah, which dominates the authority, refused to embrace it and the plan went nowhere.",
      "Rubio will meet with Netanyahu on Sunday before traveling onward to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, regional heavyweights that have rejected any mass displacement of Palestinians and would be key to any regional response.",
      "The United Arab Emirates was the driving force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords in which four Arab states normalized relations with Israel during Trump's previous term. Trump hopes to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, potentially offering closer U.S. defense ties, but the kingdom has said it will not normalize relations with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state.",
      "Rubio will not be visiting Egypt or Jordan, close U.S. allies at peace with Israel that have refused to accept any influx of Palestinian refugees. Trump has at times suggested he might slash U.S. aid to the two countries, which could be devastating for their economies, if they don't comply.",
      "He is also skipping Qatar, which along with Egypt had served as a key mediator with Hamas in brokering the ceasefire.",
      "Trump took credit for the ceasefire, which was reached in the closing days of the Biden administration after his Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, joined the talks. But more recently, Trump has suggested that Israel resume the war if the remaining dozens of hostages abducted in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the fighting, are not released sooner than planned.",

      "The main suspects, two Croatian nationals, are considered high-value targets by Europol, said an agency statement. They are believed to have orchestrated the illegal hazardous waste imports from Italy, Slovenia and Germany to Croatia.",
      "Rather than being properly treated, the waste was simply dumped and buried, Europol said. The statement added that at least 35,000 tons (38,580 U.S. tons) of waste were illegally disposed of resulting in a profit of at least 4 million euros ($4.2 million).",
      "The waste was declared as recyclable plastic waste but was \u201clegally considered dangerous waste,\u201d Europol said. Croatian authorities believe the criminal network also illegally buried and dumped medical waste from Croatian companies, it said.",

      "BEIRUT -- Thousands of supporters gathered in downtown Beirut on Friday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri\u2019s assassination, which comes amid seismic regional political shifts.",
      "The ousting of Bashar Assad in December after 54 years of family rule in Syria marked the fall of a government long accused of orchestrating Hariri\u2019s assassination and other political killings in Lebanon.",
      "Meanwhile, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah \u2014 whose members were convicted by a U.N.-backed tribunal for their role in Hariri\u2019s murder \u2014 now faces its own turning point following the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an Israeli airstrike in September. Nasrallah\u2019s funeral is set for February 23.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning of justice. If the justice of the earth did not serve us, no one escapes the justice of heaven,\" said Hariri\u2019s son, former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, as he addressed a huge crowd in the capital Beirut.",
      "\"After 20 years, Rafik Hariri\u2019s project is continuing, and those who tried to kill the project, look where they are now,\" Saad added.",
      "Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, appointed in early February, visited Hariri\u2019s burial site earlier Friday.",
      "\u201cToday, we remember the legacy of the great martyr in serving Lebanon, preserving its national unity, and working for its prosperity,\u201d Salam wrote on X. \u201cHe was greatly respected in the Arab world and the world, leaving Lebanon with a remarkable moral and political legacy.\u201d",
      "Lebanon\u2019s president Joseph Aoun also paid tribute to Hariri, saying on X that Hariri's \"national stances were a fundamental building block in strengthening national unity and protecting civil peace.\u201d",
      "Hariri was killed on Feb. 14, 2005, when a massive bomb exploded near the St. Georges Hotel, a historic landmark on Beirut\u2019s waterfront. The blast killed 21 other people and injured over 200.",
      "In 2020, a U.N.-backed tribunal convicted one member of the Hezbollah militant group and acquitted three others of involvement in the assassination. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon said Salim Ayyash was guilty as a co-conspirator of five charges linked to his involvement in the suicide truck bombing.",
      "None of the suspects was ever arrested or attended court to hear the verdicts.",
      "The assassination of Hariri ignited the \u201cCedar Revolution,\u201d leading to massive protests against Syria\u2019s nearly three-decade military presence in Lebanon, ultimately culminating in the withdrawal of Syrian troops in 2005. The assassination also intensified sectarian divisions within Lebanon and bolstered the political influence of Assad's ally, Hezbollah.",
      "Buses from across Lebanon arrived early, bringing supporters to downtown Beirut to commemorate the anniversary. Thousands of people filled the streets and waved Lebanese flags and the blue flag of Hariri's Future Movement to songs honoring Hariri's memory.",
      "\u201cAfter the Syrian and Iranian guardianship ended and the ousting of the Syrian regime, the Lebanese state alone rules us,\u201d Mohammad Kanaan told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIn this square, you expelled Bashar Assad from Lebanon,\u201d Saad said during his speech. \u201cAnd after twenty years of sectarian rule, detention and brutality, the heroic Syrian people rose up and expelled the criminal from Syria.\u201d",
      "Another supporter, Ahmad Serhal, said he hoped that \u201cLebanon would unite\u201d after the departure of Assad. \u201cAll the political shifts are for the good of this country. Lebanon is for all the Lebanese, we need to reach an agreement and unite.\u201d",
      "\u201cGod took revenge upon those who assassinated president Rafik \u2014 from ousting Assad, from ousting the system that is allied with Iran,\u201d Ahmad Trab said. \u201cWe hope for a better future now with Syria.\u201d",
      "The anniversary of Hariri\u2019s death comes just four days before the deadline for Israeli troops to withdraw from southern Lebanon under a ceasefire agreement that ended a 14-month war with Hezbollah in late November. The ceasefire deal also stipulates that Hezbollah must end its military presence south of the Litani River, with the Lebanese Army and UN peacekeepers deploying in the vacated areas.",
      "The pullout deadline, initially set for Jan. 26, was postponed to Feb. 18.",
      "Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said Lebanon \u201cabsolutely rejects\u201d an Israeli proposal to keep troops in five strategic border points after the withdrawal. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the Americans to impose (the withdrawal), otherwise they will have caused the biggest setback for the government,\u201d he said.",
      "Aoun has also insisted that Israel must adhere to the agreed-upon timeline. During his speech, Saad also emphasized the need for the Israeli army's withdrawal from Lebanon.",
      "Saad addressed the people of southern and eastern Lebanon, regions largely supporters of and influenced by Hezbollah, urging them to seize Lebanon\u2019s golden opportunity while dispelling any perception of being \u201ca force of obstruction.\u201d",
      "On Feb. 8, Lebanon formed a new government led by Salam, the first fully empowered administration since 2022. Salam, a former president of the International Court of Justice, was appointed following the election of Aoun in January. The 24-member cabinet includes a mix of technocrats and political figures, representing various sects, including Hezbollah\u2019s allies.",
      "Although Hezbollah did not formally endorse Salam\u2019s appointment, the group negotiated during the government formation process.",
      "The United States has expressed support for the new government, emphasizing the importance of stability and reforms, though opposing Hezbollah\u2019s direct participation in the cabinet. Salam's government now faces Lebanon\u2019s longstanding economic crisis and an urgent need to implement key financial reforms.",
      "The political shift has reopened the door for renewed Arab engagement, particularly from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which had previously distanced themselves from Lebanon due to the growing influence of Iran and its ally, Hezbollah.",
      "These countries, which had strong ties with Lebanon under Hariri, are now reassessing their approach, with hopes of reintegrating Lebanon into the Arab fold."

      "\u201cDefense sector is a big money, and India happens to be one of the top buyers in the world,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Vinod Bhatia, India\u2019s director-general for military operations from 2012 to 2014. \u201cAs long as we buy, Trump will be happy but it\u2019s surely going to expand our conventional deterrence.\u201d",
      "The meeting signaled that \u201cdefense diplomacy is the core of diplomacy these days,\" Bhatia said.",
      "In a joint statement at the White House, the two leaders announced plans to sign a new 10-year framework later this year for the U.S.-India Major Defense Partnership.",
      "Modi and Trump \u201cpledged to elevate military cooperation across all domains \u2014 air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace \u2014 through enhanced training, exercises, and operations, incorporating the latest technologies,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The leaders also \u201ccommitted to break new ground to support and sustain the overseas deployments of the U.S. and Indian militaries in the Indo-Pacific, including enhanced logistics and intelligence sharing,\" the statement said.",
      "While Indian military experts have long sought to diversify national defense procurements, analysts say it will take years to reduce New Delhi\u2019s dependency on Russian arms, even with expanded defense cooperation with the U.S.",
      "Raja Mohan, an analyst at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore, said expansion in defense cooperation would take time.",
      "\u201cWhat India wants is coproduction and more research and development in India. It\u2019s a long-term project,\u201d he said.",
      "It is difficult for India to remain dependent on Russia for defense equipment owing to difficulties obtaining parts and upgrades. However, a deal with the U.S. for F-35 stealth fighter jets will not fill India's immediate need for more than 100 aircraft, said Rahul Bedi, an independent defense analyst based in India.",
      "\u201cThey are not going to come tomorrow,\u201d Bedi said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take several years to start arriving,\u201d he added.",
      "As its geostrategic competition with China has grown manifold in recent years, India has diversified defense acquisitions from the U.S., Israel and France while seeking to move toward self-reliance in this sector. But New Delhi is still far from getting over its dependence on supplies and spare parts from Russia that makes up to 60% of Indian defense equipment.",
      "With vast borders and protracted border conflicts with neighboring countries Pakistan and China, India also relies hugely on Moscow for military upgrades and modernization.",
      "\u201cIndia faces threats from China and Pakistan, and a threat from collaborative Pakistan-China. We need technologically capable systems to counter these threats and one country that can give such systems is America,\u201d said Lt. Gen. D.S. Hooda, who from 2014 to 2016 headed the Indian military\u2019s Northern Command.",
      "China\u2019s rise as a global power also has pushed India closer to the U.S. and to the Quad, a new Indo-Pacific strategic alliance among the U.S., India, Australia and Japan.",
      "The growing strategic alliance accuses China of economic coercion and military maneuvering in the region, upsetting the status quo, and has ruffled feathers in Beijing, which sees the relationship as a counterweight against China\u2019s rise.",
      "Indian fears of Chinese territorial expansion are bolstered by the growing presence of the Chinese navy in the Indian Ocean and Beijing\u2019s efforts to strengthen ties with not only Pakistan but also Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.",
      "\u201cThe major threat is from China which is outstripping India\u2019s capability,\u201d Hooda said.",
      "In the early 1990s, about 70% of Indian army weapons, 80% of its air force systems and 85% of its navy platforms were of Soviet origin. From 2016 to 2020, Russia accounted for nearly 49% of India\u2019s defense imports while French and Israeli shares were 18% and 13%, respectively, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.",
      "Major Indian purchases from the U.S. included long-range maritime patrol aircraft, C-130 transport aircraft, missiles and drones.",
      "The defense sales also can potentially offset the trade deficit between the two countries, Hooda said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for all. America will get more business, and we\u2019ll get modern weapons,\u201d Hooda said. \u201cIt will also help to ease pressure on the tariff issue and trade deficit.\u201d",

      "Australian and Philippine authorities have taken steps on Valentine\u2019s Day to help would-be victims avoid hurting their \u201chearts and bank accounts\u201d in online love scams",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Australian and Philippine authorities took steps on Valentine\u2019s Day to help would-be victims avoid hurting their \u201chearts and bank accounts\u201d in online love scams.",
      "The Australian Federal Police, with the help of Filipino authorities, on Friday publicized online dialogues used by an online love scam syndicate, which had been dismantled in the Philippines, to help foster vigilance.",
      "\u201cThe Australian Federal Police is flipping the script on romance scammers this Valentine\u2019s Day by revealing real-life dialogue used to target the bank accounts \u2014 and hearts \u2014 of thousands of potential victims online,\u201d a joint statement by the Australian police, the Philippine Anti-Organized Crime Commission and other law enforcement agencies said.",
      "Philippine authorities raided the syndicate\u2019s hideout near Manila in October, arrested more than 250 mostly Chinese suspected members and seized computers and other gadgets used in the online fraud.",
      "After an investigation, Australian and Philippine police found the syndicate had attempted to victimize about 5,000 people in Australia alone. They were trying to check if those Australians have already been defrauded, Australian Federal Police officer Kathleen Oehlers said in a news conference in Manila with Philippine anti-crime officials.",
      "About $15 million have been lost to such online love scams from victims in Australia last year alone, according to Oehlers.",
      "Under the scheme, the suspects would hunt for potential victims, mostly fully employed males, in online dating apps and then use romantic dialogues to develop a whirlwind romance online. A victim would later be encouraged by a scammer under cover of a fake picture and identity to invest in cryptocurrency, initially with relatively small amounts, before shifting the funds to the syndicate\u2019s account, Oehlers said.",
      "Philippine Undersecretary Gilbert Cruz, who heads the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission, said that aside from publicizing the dialogues used by the syndicate to lure and defraud victims, the Australian police also provided crucial tips online. They included being wary of red flags like \u201coverly affectionate behavior,\u201d he said.",
      "Philippine authorities would take similar steps to foster vigilance, Cruz said.",
      "\"The scammer would portray a kind-hearted Filipino woman living in Australia or a local female resident in the Philippines, heartbroken by an ex-fiance who wanted my money, not my love,\u2019\u201d the statement said.",
      "\"I\u2019m sorry if our first day of chat is very emotional. By the way, how\u2019s your business?\u201d according to one of the scripts used by the syndicate to shift the topic to cryptocurrency investment.",
      "Last year, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered the closure of the mostly Chinese-run online gaming operations up to the end of 2024, accusing them of venturing into crimes, including financial scams, human trafficking, torture, kidnappings and murder.",
      "The Chinese-run online gambling outfits were estimated to number more than 400 across the Philippines and employ hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Southeast Asian nationals.",
      "The ban forced many remaining syndicates to break into smaller outfits in the Philippines and diversify their operations into an array of online love, cryptocurrency and investment scams, the Philippine anti-organized crime commission said."

      "Panda craze has once again gripped Hong Kong as residents compete to name the territory\u2019s first locally-born giant panda cubs who just turned six months old",
      "HONG KONG -- Panda craze has once again gripped Hong Kong as residents compete to name the territory\u2019s first locally-born giant panda cubs who just turned six months old.",
      "The competition to name the twin cubs, born Aug. 15, launched Saturday following a celebratory ceremony attended by Hong Kong leader John Lee and other officials at Ocean Park, the theme park that houses the twins, their parents and two other giant pandas that arrived from mainland China last year. Residents can submit their suggestions via the park's website.",
      "Lee said the southern Chinese city now has the largest number of pandas in captivity outside of mainland China, and the cubs\u2019 names would be announced in the first half of this year.",
      "The pair, currently identified as the \u201cElder Sister\u201d and the \u201cLittle Brother,\" will make their public debut on Sunday and meet visitors for five hours daily. Those who want to enjoy time with the cubs outside regular visiting hours, before the park opens, can pay 1,500 Hong Kong dollars (about $190).",
      "During a media preview session on Saturday, the male cub laid on a swing playing with a tree stick before a carer placed him on a slide. The female cub explored the enclosure before climbing onto a tree.",
      "The panda carers said the female cub seemed more active than her male twin. She loves climbing the tree inside the enclosure and resting there while her brother likes to wander around and play with the plants. The male cub has been marked with two purple food-coloring spots on its back to distinguish it from his sister.",
      "The birth of the baby pandas last year made their mother Ying Ying the world\u2019s oldest first-time panda mom.",
      "Their popularity on social media also raised hopes for the city's tourism boost. Officials have encouraged businesses to capitalize on the panda craze to seize opportunities in what some lawmakers have dubbed the \u201cpanda economy.\u201d",
      "Ocean Park\u2019s chairman Paulo Pong told reporters on Saturday that the park already saw income increases over the Christmas period and Lunar New Year holiday, alongside an uptake in overseas tourists, after the newly arrived pandas from mainland China started to greet the public.",
      "\u201cWe're turning the page and we believe the pandas are definitely helping the income of the park,\u201d he said.",
      "But caring for pandas in captivity is expensive. Ocean Park recorded a deficit of 71.6 million Hong Kong dollars ($9.2 million) last financial year, and in 2020 required a government relief fund to stay afloat. Observers are watching if taking care of six pandas will add to its burden or give it a chance to revive its business.",
      "Pong said raising pandas was about animal conservation and education, instead of \u201cjust a money exercise.\"",
      "Pandas are considered China\u2019s unofficial national mascot. The country\u2019s giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing\u2019s soft-power diplomacy."

      "A man from Memphis, Tennessee, has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife during their honeymoon in Fiji in 2022",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A man from Memphis, Tennessee, was sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife during their honeymoon in Fiji in 2022, a court official said on Friday.",
      "Bradley Robert Dawson, 40, will have to serve at least 18 years in prison before he can be considered for release, a Fiji High Court registry official in Lautoka said.",
      "Dawson was convicted in December of murdering his wife, Christe Chen, who was then 36, at the exclusive Turtle Island resort in the Yasawa archipelago two days after the newlyweds arrived in the South Pacific nation. He then fled by kayak to a nearby island.",
      "He was sentenced by Justice Riyaz Hamza on Wednesday.",
      "Hamza told Dawson he had shown disregard for Chen\u2019s right to life and her personal liberty.",
      "\u201cYour conduct after the incident was appalling. Having inflicted serious and life-threatening injuries to the deceased you fled the scene of the crime, leaving the deceased alone and helpless,\u201d Hamza said, according to The Fiji Times newspaper.",
      "Chen's body was discovered in the couple\u2019s room by resort staff with multiple blunt trauma wounds to her head after the couple was heard arguing and did not appear at breakfast or lunch the next day.",
      "Dawson pleaded not guilty to the charge and was tried over eight days.",
      "His lawyer Anil Prasad told the court that prosecutors had failed provide sufficient evidence to convict Dawson, the Fijian Broadcasting Corp. reported.",
      "Prasad said that while the prosecution alleged that Dawson was planning to flee Fiji, authorities failed to acknowledge that many of the couple\u2019s personal belongings remained at the resort.",
      "Prasad also said Dawson had no injuries to suggest he had been involved in a physical altercation with his wife.",
      "But the judge said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Dawson and no one else had committed the crime.",
      "Under Fijian law, prisoners can apply for parole after serving a minimum term set by a court, although the parole board is currently unstaffed. Critics argue the lack of an effective parole option is a cause of prison overcrowding.",
      "David Naylor, an Australian National University expert on Pacific law and regulation who has lectured in Fiji, said that after serving 18 years in prison, Dawson could apply to the national Mercy Commission to be released with a pardon from the Fijian president.",
      "He could also apply for his life sentence to be reduced to a fixed term, which would set a release date, Naylor said.",
      "Dawson worked in the information technology department at Youth Villages, a nonprofit child welfare and support organization based in Memphis. An online records search showed no criminal arrests for Dawson in Shelby County, which includes Memphis.",
      "The Turtle Island resort, where the pair stayed, is an exclusive and remote 500-acre island that accommodates only 14 couples at a time. Yasawa is a group of about 20 volcanic islands in the west of Fiji, a nation of 930,000 people."

      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Three more Israelis held captive in the Gaza Strip are on the verge of being freed Saturday as part of a shaky ceasefire deal that requires Israel to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange.",
      "The truce that began nearly four weeks ago had been jeopardized in recent days by a tense dispute that threatened to renew the fighting.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial proposal to remove more than 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them elsewhere in the region has cast even more doubt on the future of the ceasefire.",
      "But Hamas said Thursday it would move ahead with the release of more hostages after talks with Egyptian and Qatari officials. The group said the mediators had pledged to \u201cremove all hurdles\u201d to assure Israel would allow more tents, medical supplies and other essentials into Gaza.",
      "The three hostages set to be released after more than 16 months in captivity are: Iair Horn, 46, a dual citizen of Israel and Argentina; Sagui Dekel Chen, 36, who is American-Israeli; and Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov, 29, who holds Israeli and Russian citizenship.",
      "The trio were abducted from one of the hardest-hit communities in southern Israel during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the devastating war.",
      "The Hamas-linked Prisoners\u2019 Information Office said Friday that 369 Palestinians were set to be released from Israeli prisons on Saturday. It said 36 of those were serving life sentences.",
      "It will be the sixth swap since the ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19. So far, 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners have been freed during the first phase of the truce.",
      "Horn, Dekel Chen and Troufanov were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where some 80 of roughly 400 residents were taken hostage during the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "Horn was abducted along with his brother, Eitan Horn, who had been staying with him at the time. Eitan remains in captivity.",
      "Dekel Chen had been working outside when militants stormed the kibbutz. His wife hid in a safe room with their two daughters. She gave birth to their third daughter two months later.",
      "Troufanov was taken hostage along with his grandmother, mother and girlfriend. The three women were released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. Troufanov\u2019s father was killed in the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "Among the most prominent Palestinian prisoners set to be released is Ahmed Barghouti, 48, a close aide of Marwan Barghouti, a militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure.",
      "Israel sentenced Ahmed Barghouti to life on charges that he dispatched suicide bombers during the Second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in the early 2000s to carry out attacks that killed Israeli civilians. He was arrested alongside Marwan Barghouti in 2002.",
      "Of the 251 people abducted, 73 remain in Gaza, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Nearly all the remaining hostages are men, including Israeli soldiers.",
      "Concern has been growing about the remaining hostages\u2019 condition, particularly after the release of three last Saturday, who emerged looking emaciated and frail.",
      "One of them, 65-year-old Keith Siegel, said Friday in a video message addressed to Trump that his captors treated him worse as the 15-month war intensified, kicking him, spitting on him and holding him without water or light.",
      "The ceasefire appeared dangerously close to collapse in recent days.",
      "Hamas had said it would delay the release of the hostages after accusing Israel of not adhering to their agreement by not allowing in enough shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble. Israel said it would resume fighting Saturday unless hostages were freed.",
      "While the immediate crisis may have been averted, the truce faces a much bigger challenge with the deal\u2019s first phase set to conclude in early March. There have not yet been substantive negotiations over the second phase, in which Hamas would release all remaining hostages in return for an end to the war.",
      "At its height, the fighting displaced 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million. Hundreds of thousands have since returned to their homes as the ceasefire took hold, though many found only rubble, buried human remains and unexploded ordnance.",
      "The war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them elsewhere in the region has thrown the truce\u2019s future into further doubt.",
      "The idea has been welcomed by Israel\u2019s government. But it has been strongly rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries. Human rights groups say it could amount to a war crime under international law.",
      "Trump has proposed that once the fighting ends, Israel would transfer control of Gaza to the United States, which would then redevelop it as the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right allies are already calling for a resumption of the war after the first phase with the goal of destroying Hamas and implementing Trump\u2019s plan. The militant group remains in control of the territory after surviving one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history.",
      "Hamas may be unwilling to release any more hostages if it believes the war will resume. The captives are among the only bargaining chips it has left."

      "Serbia\u2019s striking students and supporters of populist President Aleksandar Vucic have planned parallel rallies as both mark the country\u2019s Statehood Day with notably contrasting messages",
      "KRAGUJEVAC, Serbia -- Serbia\u2019s striking students and supporters of populist President Aleksandar Vucic have planned parallel rallies on Saturday as both mark the country's Statehood Day with notably contrasting messages.",
      "The student-led protest is the latest in a nationwide anti-graft movement that reflects mounting calls for fundamental political changes in the Balkan state, triggered after a concrete canopy on a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad collapsed on Nov. 1, killing 15 people.",
      "The rally, in the central industrial city of Kragujevac, is set to draw tens of thousands of people who, bedsides demanding justice over a fatal accident, have been asking to root out rampant endemic corruption and respect for the rule of law.",
      "Students chose Kragujevac for Saturday's rally because of its history; In 1835, Serbia was still part of the Ottoman Empire. People in Kragujevac announced a new constitution that sought to limit the powers of the then-rulers. The date is now celebrated as the Statehood Day.",
      "The students arrived at the city on Friday and were met with cheers and support by the residents. Ahead of Saturday's protest, they organized marches in various parts of the country, encouraging people to converge in Kragujevac. Some walked, others ran or cycled. Along their journey, people greeted them with food and refreshments and offered accommodation, many crying and expressing hope for change.",
      "Meanwhile, in Sremska Mitrovica, a small town northwest of Belgrade, Vucic is expected to recycle a traditional nationalist theme, warning that the West wants to unseat him by force and that this could lead to the breakup of the country.",
      "Serbian authorities are expected to bus in thousands of their supporters from throughout Serbia as well as Bosnia to Sremska Mitrovica on Saturday. Some opposition activists have said they will try to prevent their arrival.",
      "The anti-graft movement is Vucic's biggest challenge in recent years. The president \u2014 who has ruled Serbia with a firm grip on power for more than a decade\u2014 and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have been previously accused of stifling democratic freedoms, publicly discrediting opponents and rigging elections, according to international vote observers.",
      "The canopy disaster, widely believed to have happened due to government corruption, has become a flashpoint for wider discontent with the authoritarian rule, with university students at the forefront of the anti-graft uprising. Their determination, youth and creativity have struck a cord among people widely disillusioned with politicians.",
      "Prosecutors have charged 13 people over the canopy fall, and protests have forced the resignation of Serbia\u2019s prime minister. But students have said their protests will continue until their demands for full accountability are met.",
      "In the past three months, the president has shifted between accusing the students of working for foreign powers to offering concessions and claiming he has fulfilled each of their demands. But during a trip to the Serb-controlled part of neighboring Bosnia this week, Vucic has reiterated claims about an alleged plot from abroad to overthrow him and his government.",
      "The authorities, Vucic said, \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe how much money has been invested to bring down the government in Serbia.\u201d He offered no proof for the claims.",
      "Vucic's trip to the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia was apparently designed to stress Serbian unity with the Serbs in Bosnia, where a bid to create a pan-Serb state in the 1990s\u2019 was widely blamed for triggering a bloody war that left more than 100,000 people killed and millions displaced.",

      "Families remained indoors and shops remained closed as M23 fighters entered the outskirts of Bukavu \u2014 a city of about 1.3 million people that lies 63 miles (101 kilometers) south of Goma, the region's largest city taken by the rebels last month.",
      "The group, backed by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east. Its southward expansion encompasses more territory than rebels had previously seized and poses an unprecedented challenge to the central government's authority.",
      "The rebellion has killed at least 2,000 people in and around Goma and left hundreds of thousands of displaced stranded, the U.N. and Congolese authorities have said.",
      "The rebels on Friday also claimed to have seized a second airport in the region, in the town of Kavumu outside Bukavu. The U.N. warned that the recent escalation of fighting with government forces has left 350,000 internally displaced people without shelter.",
      "The Associated Press could not immediately confirm who was in control of the strategically important airport, which Congolese forces have used to resupply troops and humanitarian groups used to import aid.",
      "Government officials and local civil society leaders did not immediately comment, though Congo's Communications Ministry said the rebels had violated ceasefire agreements and attacked Congolese troops working to avoid urban warfare and violence in Bukavu.",
      "M23 spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said on X that the rebels took over Kavumu airport and its surroundings to \u201celiminate the threat at the source.\u201d",

Congo\u2019s military, despite its size and funding, has long been hindered by shortcomings in training and coordination and recurring reports of corruption.",
      "International leaders are expected to discuss the conflict at the African Union summit in Ethiopia this weekend as Congo\u2019s President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi continues to plead the international community to intervene to contain the rebels from advancing. However, little progress has been made since the government dismissed a ceasefire that M23 declared last wee unilaterally as false.",
      "Meanwhile, in South Kivu province, residents fled Bukavu into neighboring towns and stocked up on household supplies in anticipation of further bloodshed in the streets. The U.N. refugee agency has said that shelling and looting have already destroyed 70,000 emergency shelters, leaving those displaced with few places to go.",
      "\u201cI noticed that the soldiers were dropping out and fleeing, so I told myself that I could no longer stay in this place,\u201d said Chirimwami Alexis, among residents fleeing from Kavumu. \u201cThe fear we have is people moving without any preparation or food. We are running away just because of this situation.\u201d",

      "Their hopes were dashed about 15 years ago when a drilling company couldn't find enough hot water close to the surface to be profitable using traditional geothermal technology. That basically left them with natural gas.",
      "\u201cWe gave up. We had big hopes,\u201d recalled First Mayor of Geretsried Michael M\u00fcller, who was raised in the town.",
      "Today the next generation of geothermal companies is trying to succeed where previous efforts failed. They don't rely on hot water close to the surface, but instead use techniques developed in the oil and gas industry to drill deep and extract heat from dry, hot rock. One of them, Eavor, is starting up its first commercial power plant in Geretsried \u2014 turning the tiny town of about 26,000 people, south of Munich, into a proving ground for the future of geothermal energy.",
      "Can technology like this be scaled and really make a difference for the future of the planet? The International Energy Agency thinks so. In a recent report, it said technology breakthroughs are unlocking huge potential for geothermal energy. Now that companies are drilling deeper than 3 kilometers (close to 2 miles), nearly every country has the potential to make heat and electricity this way, the IEA said.",
      "\u201cIt has been a niche energy and concentrated in a few countries,\u201d IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in an interview. But soon, Birol said, \"geothermal can contribute to the global energy picture in an accelerated manner.\u201d",
      "Eavor CEO John Redfern said the earlier failure in Gerestried opened up the possibility for a high-profile success \u2014 Geretsried\u2019s ordinary geology was appealing. No one would\u2019ve been impressed if the Canadian company demonstrated its technology in Iceland, a place with abundant, easily accessible hot water, he added.",
      "It helped that the town was excited for geothermal and open to new ideas, he added.",
      "\u201cOur whole point is that we want to have geothermal anywhere, everywhere,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cWhat better way to prove that than to put our first well where they tried and failed with traditional geothermal systems.\u201d",
      "Germany is committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels. As part of the commitment, heating systems must switch to renewable sources because heating is one of the main sources of carbon dioxide emissions in Germany. And Germany couldn\u2019t depend on importing natural gas from Russia after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Eavor, named for the phrase \u201cenergy for ever,\u201d has a demonstration facility in Alberta, Canada. Company executives know Geretsried well. One of them managed operations for the contractor that drilled there previously.",
      "This project will start by generating electricity in Geretsried, then add heat as the town fully builds out a district heating system.",
      "With district heating, heat is generated in a central location and distributed to homes and businesses. Most of these systems make their heat from burning fossil fuels, especially in China and Russia, which have the largest number of them, according to the IEA. Europe has 17,000 district heating and cooling networks, serving 67 million people, according to Euroheat & Power, the international network for district energy.",
      "In the United States, district energy systems are most often on college campuses, at hospitals, on military bases and in some downtown areas in larger cities. Some universities are switching their district heating systems off gas or heating oil to geothermal energy to address climate change. The Trump administration, while pivoting back to pro-oil and gas policies, does appear to also favor geothermal.",
      "Eavor has a contract to provide heat in the northwestern German city of Hanover, too. The city of more than 500,000 people is phasing out coal.",
      "Eavor is also licensing its technology to utilities and companies that are trying to curb emissions and want secure energy, Redfern said. A large Japanese power provider, Chubu Electric Power Company, is a major investor in Eavor. Japan has many sites suitable for geothermal but few geothermal power plants.",
      "The way it works is that Eavor drills two wells about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep, then branches out and drills a dozen lateral wells, to maximize contact with the hot rock. The wells intersect to create a closed loop where water can flow, the \u201cEavor loop.\u201d The Geretsried project will have four loops, each with two vertical wells and about 12 lateral ones.",
      "Eavor does not frack, or hydraulically fracture, to create cracks and increase the permeability of rock.",
      "Instead in Geretsried, it will pump water down to flow through the hot rock, heating up on contact. It will rise naturally to the surface through an outlet well.",
      "That hot water can be used to heat the utility's water so it can be sent through pipes to heat the equivalent of about 36,000 homes. The hot water also can be routed to a power plant to make steam and then recirculated. When used to spin a turbine, that steam can generate electricity without any planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "M\u00fcller, the mayor, said it's better to start changing the approach to energy today than push it off to tomorrow. He said residents can't rely on fossil fuels long term, they have to address climate change and they need secure energy.",
      "\u201cWe want to remain future proof,\u201d he said. \u201cSo let's start the future.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to slash the size of the federal workforce reached the Food and Drug Administration this weekend",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration\u2019s effort to slash the size of the federal workforce reached the Food and Drug Administration this weekend, as recently hired employees who review the safety of food ingredients, medical devices and other products were fired.",
      "Probationary employees across the FDA received notices Saturday evening that their jobs were being eliminated, according to three FDA staffers who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The total number of positions eliminated was not clear Sunday, but the firings appeared to focus on employees in the agency\u2019s centers for food, medical devices and tobacco products \u2014 which includes oversight of electronic cigarettes. It was not clear whether FDA employees who review drugs were exempted.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced plans to fire 5,200 probationary employees across its agencies, which include the National Institutes of Health, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "People who spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity on Friday said the number of probationary employees to be laid off at the CDC would total nearly 1,300. But as of early Sunday afternoon, about 700 people had received notices, according to three people who spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. They said none of the CDC layoffs affected the young doctors and researchers who track diseases in what\u2019s known as the Epidemic Intelligence Service.",
      "The FDA is headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington and employs nearly 20,000 people. It's long been a target of newly sworn-in health secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., who last year accused the agency of waging a \u201cwar on public health\u201d for not approving unproven treatments such as psychedelics, stem cells and chelation therapy.",
      "Kennedy also has called for eliminating thousands of chemicals and colorings from U.S. foods. But the cuts at FDA include staffers responsible for reviewing the safety of new food additives and ingredients, according to an FDA staffer familiar with the firings.",
      "An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday afternoon.",
      "Nearly half of the FDA\u2019s $6.9 billion budget comes from fees paid by companies the agency regulates, including drug and medical device makers, which allows the agency to hire extra scientists to swiftly review products. Eliminating those positions will not reduce government spending.",
      "A former FDA official said cutting recent hires could backfire, eliminating staffers who tend to be younger and have more up-to-date technical skills. The FDA\u2019s workforce skews toward older workers who have spent one or two decades at the agency, and the Government Accountability Office noted in 2022 that the FDA \u201chas historically faced challenges in recruiting and retaining\u201d staff due to better money in the private sector.",
      "\u201cYou want to bring in new blood,\u201d said Peter Pitts, a former FDA associate commissioner under President George W. Bush. \u201cYou want people with new ideas, greater enthusiasm and the latest thinking in terms of technology.\u201d",
      "Mitch Zeller, former FDA director for tobacco, said the firings are a way to \u201cdemoralize and undermine the spirit of the federal workforce.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe combined effect of what they're trying to do is going to destroy the ability to recruit and retain talent,\" Zeller said.",
      "The FDA\u2019s inspection force has been particularly strained in recent years after a wave of departures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many of the agency\u2019s current inspectors are recent hires. It was not immediately clear whether those employees were exempted.",
      "FDA inspectors are responsible for overseeing thousands of food, drug, tobacco and medical device facilities worldwide, though the AP reported last year that the agency faced a backlog of roughly 2,000 uninspected drug facilities that hadn\u2019t been visited since before the pandemic.",

      "HONG KONG -- Tens of thousands of people in densely populated, land-poor Hong Kong live in tiny dwellings made by dividing up apartments, most smaller than a parking space. It's an affordable option for students and low-income families but can also mean banging shins in cramped and in some cases substandard living spaces.",
      "The city's government has proposed new rules that would set minimum standards for such housing units, but residents and advocates for the poor worry that it could drive up rents and make it even harder to hang on in the city. The city's eventual goal, mandated by Beijing, is to eliminate subdivided apartments over the next 25 years.",
      "Officials are aiming to pass the rules into law within the year. After that, landlords will have a grace period to make their substandard flats meet the bar. The government has promised to assist affected residents in resettlement and adopt a gradual approach in its policy implementation to avoid causing panic.",

      "Musk, who previously called himself a \u201cfan of Modi,\" has long wanted his Starlink satellite internet service to make an entry into the Indian market. Its launch, however, has been delayed due to regulatory challenges, security concerns and opposition from domestic telecom giants like Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio.",
      "Last November, India\u2019s telecoms minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said Starlink was yet to comply with security norms, and a license for satellite communications services will be issued only after the company meets all the requirements.",

      "India\u2019s satellite broadband service market is highly competitive. At least six companies control the market, led by Ambani\u2019s Reliance Jio.",
      "Apart from regulatory roadblocks, Musk's Starlink has also faced resistance by Reliance Jio, which last year said granting spectrum for satellite services through auctioning is necessary to ensure fair competition.",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink has at least 6,900 active satellites orbiting Earth that provide low-latency broadband to some 4.6 million people. But if Musk wants to enter the Indian market, Starlink's high pricing could be a concern.",
      "Mobile data in India is among the cheapest globally, and Ambani's Jio once gave data for free on its mobile plans. And yet, at least 40% of the country\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people still don\u2019t have access to the internet. Cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India\u2019s vast remote and mountainous areas.",

      "Gov. Spencer Cox announced his decision Friday evening following a week of rallies outside his office in which thousands of union members from the public and private sector urged him to veto the bill.

      "LOS ANGELES -- Americans looking to buy a newly built home this spring are likely to get a helping hand with their mortgage rate and other costs.",
      "Many homebuilders are offering buyers valuable incentives like paying down their mortgage rate, covering closing costs or even throwing in \u201cflex dollars\u201d that home shoppers can put toward upgrades or other costs.",
      "While the sales strategy isn\u2019t new, builders are under pressure this year to ramp up such incentives because they\u2019re facing a tough spring homebuying season.",
      "Stubbornly high mortgage rates, more competition from existing homes on the market and the realization that years of rising home prices have pushed affordability to the limit for many prospective buyers gives builders little opportunity to ease off the costly incentives.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re running into more competition, fewer buyers and increased costs to sell a home,\u201d said Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda.",
      "And dialing back incentives may not be easy, as home shoppers have now come to expect them.",
      "\u201cWe should anticipate that builder incentives are here to stay,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a world where they don\u2019t need them, unless interest rates came down, and most signs point to higher-for-longer with interest rates.\u201d",
      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising prices have kept many prospective home shoppers on the sidelines, especially first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity from an existing home to put toward a purchase. While mortgage rates have eased in recent weeks, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has been hovering around 7% since November after climbing from a 2-year low of just over 6% in September, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Builders have increasingly relied on buyer incentives to mitigate the impact of higher borrowing costs on home shoppers as the average rate on a 30-year mortgage more than doubled in recent years from its pandemic-era historic low of 2.65%. Many builders have also lowered prices.",
      "The share of homebuilders that offer sales incentives has ranged between 60% and 64% since June, while between 30% and 33% have lowered prices, according to surveys by the National Association of Home Builders.",
      "The use of buyer incentives helped drive sales of new homes higher last year, while the resale home market remained in a deep slump. Sales of newly built single-family homes rose 2.6% last year to around 1.02 million units, the highest level since 2021, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in 2024 to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "While mortgage buydowns and other incentives can help builders entice buyers, their cost eats into their profit margins. The average operating margin for 12 of the largest homebuilders, including D.R. Horton, PulteGroup and Lennar, was 15.08% in the fourth-quarter, according to data compiled by FactSet. That\u2019s down from an average of 16.3% in the same period a year earlier.",
      "The concern now is that builders will have to maintain, if not boost, buyer incentives to continue mitigating the impact of high mortgage rates at a time when home shoppers have a wider selection to choose from. Last month, active listings \u2014 a tally that encompasses all homes on the market except those pending a finalized sale \u2014 were up 25% from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Rising construction costs and uncertainty over the impact that the Trump administration\u2019s trade and immigration policies may have on building materials and labor costs, respectively, are also fueling worries on Wall Street about how well builder profit margins will hold up this year.",
      "\u201cWe expect order growth to come at the expense of margins for homebuilders,\u201d analysts at BofA Securities wrote in a recent research note. They also said they expect a \u201cchallenging environment for homebuilders to persist\u201d through the first half of this year.",
      "Concern over builders\u2019 profit margins has weighed on the stocks, with many homebuilders off to a downbeat start this year after lagging the overall stock market in 2024.",
      "D.R. Horton, the nation\u2019s largest builder by closings, is down around 7.5% this year. Lennar is down 5.6% and NVR is off 10.2%.",
      "The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF, which tracks a variety of building products companies, is up 1.4%. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up about 4%.",

      "Retail sales dropped 0.9% in January from the previous month, the Commerce Department said, after two months of healthy gains. It was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest decline since last January.",
      "The average temperature in January was the lowest since 1988, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, and was particularly disruptive in the South. Devastating fires in Los Angeles may have also impacted spending.",
      "Sales plummeted 2.8% last month at auto dealers and slumped at furniture stores, home and garden centers, Even in the usually strong online retail sector saw a 1.9% decline. Sales rose at general merchandise stores, a category that includes big retailers like Walmart and Target, and at restaurants and bars.",
      "In addition to cold weather, the decline could reflect falling consumer confidence as reflected in recent surveys by the Conference Board and University of Michigan. Still, hiring and wage growth have been steady, suggesting the economy is still expanding. Last week the government reported that the unemployment rate fell for the second straight month to a low 4%.",
      "Yet inflation also ticked higher last month, underscoring its persistence despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool prices through higher interest rates. The cost of groceries jumped in January from the previous month, pushed higher by soaring egg prices. Rising costs could be exacting a toll on shoppers.",
      "President Donald Trump is also stepping up tariff threats, which could raise prices further. Trump said Thursday he would soon impose \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on countries that levy large duties on U.S. goods exports. Trump has already added 10% import taxes on goods from China, and has said he will place 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.",

      "The White House barred a credentialed Associated Press reporter and photographer from boarding the presidential airplane Friday for a weekend trip with Donald Trump, saying the news agency\u2019s stance on how to refer to the Gulf of Mexico was to blame for the exclusion. It represented a significant escalation by the White House in a four-day dispute with the AP over access to the presidency.",
      "The administration has blocked the AP from covering a handful of events at the White House this week, including a news conference with India's leader and several times in the Oval Office. It\u2019s all because the news outlet has not followed Trump\u2019s lead in renaming the body of water, which lies partially outside U.S. territory, to the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "AP reporters and photographers travel with the president virtually everywhere as part of a press \u201cpool\u201d and have for decades. AP journalism serves millions of readers and thousands of news outlets around the world.",
      "Journalists consider the administration's move a violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment \u2014 a governmental attempt to dictate what a news company publishes under threat of retribution. The Trump administration says the AP has no special right of access to events where space is limited, particularly given the news service's \u201ccommitment to misinformation.\u201d",
      "AP calls that assertion entirely untrue.",
      "\u201cFreedom of speech is a pillar of American democracy and a core value of the American people. The White House has said it supports these principles,\u201d AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said Friday night. \u201cThe actions taken to restrict AP\u2019s coverage of presidential events because of how we refer to a geographic location chip away at this important right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution for all Americans.\u201d",
      "The body of water in question has been called the Gulf of Mexico for hundreds of years. AP, whose influential stylebook is used by news outlets as an arbiter of language and usage, advised that because of its broad set of global customers, it would both refer to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico and also reference Trump\u2019s order changing the name to the Gulf of America within the United States.",
      "At the same time, the AP switched style last month from Denali to Mount McKinley for the mountain in Alaska that Trump ordered renamed. That location lies entirely within U.S. jurisdiction.",
      "Taylor Budowich, White House deputy chief of staff, said in a post to X Friday \u2014 one that was later released as a White House statement \u2014 that the AP \u201ccontinues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America. This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes The Associated Press\u2019 commitment to misinformation.\u201d",
      "While the First Amendment protects the AP\u2019s \u201cright to irresponsible and dishonest reporting,\u201d it doesn\u2019t ensure unfettered access to limited spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One, Budowich said. He said AP would retain its credentials to the White House complex overall.",
      "On Friday, an AP reporter and photographer had traveled to Joint Base Andrews for their participation in the traveling press pool to Trump's Florida residence. But, after clearing security, neither was allowed to board Air Force One, a decision they were told was \u201coutlet-specific.\u201d Meanwhile, reporters in the press pool who were permitted on the plane sent the AP journalists pictures of cards with their names saying \u201cwelcome aboard\u201d on their empty seats.",
      "Other news organizations, like The New York Times and Washington Post, have also said they would primarily use Gulf of Mexico. Fox News said that it was switching to Gulf of America.",
      "The White House Correspondents Association has issued statements condemning the action against AP. Although there are talks going on behind the scenes, individual news outlets have been relatively quiet.",
      "The Times, through spokesman Charles Stadtlander, said on Friday that \"we stand by The Associated Press in condemning repeated acts of retribution by this administration for editorial decisions it disagrees with. Any move to limit access or impede reporters doing their jobs is at odds with the press freedoms enshrined in the Constitution.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the Washington Post said that the AP's \u201caccess to the administration is central for all journalistic organizations, including The Washington Post, in serving millions of Americans with fact-based, independent journalism each day.\u201d",
      "The issue was gaining some international attention.",
      "\u201cWe would never kick a news agency out of the press room of our Chancellery,\" said Friedrich Merz, the top opposition leader in Germany and front-runner in polls ahead of the country's Feb. 23 elections. He spoke Saturday at a security conference in Munich also attended by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and top Trump administration officials.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who on Wednesday used the word \u201clies\u201d in describing AP content, posted on X Friday afternoon about executive orders Trump had signed before his departure. She ended her post: \u201cThe @AP was not invited.\u201d",

    "summary": "Record high egg prices prompted Nevada lawmakers to unanimously back suspending their cage-free egg law, but the six other states with similar laws in effect have shown no sign of dropping them even if it might help lower grocery bills",
    "story": [
      "Record high egg prices prompted Nevada lawmakers to unanimously back suspending their cage-free egg law, but the six other states with similar laws in effect have shown no sign of dropping them even if it might help lower grocery bills",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Back when egg prices remained securely under $2 a dozen in 2021, Nevada joined several other states concerned about animal welfare in requiring cage-free eggs.",
      "Now four years later, a dozen eggs costs an average of nearly $5 in the U.S. because of the lingering bird flu, so Nevada passed a law the governor signed Thursday that will allow the state to suspend that law temporarily in hopes of getting residents some relief at the checkout counter.",
      "But it is not quite that simple, which is why the other six states with the same laws are so far reticent to follow suit.",
      "By relaxing the rule, Nevada might get access to additional eggs, but the supply of all eggs remains tight because nearly 159 million birds have been slaughtered since the bird flu outbreak began in 2022 to help limit virus spread. The virus prompts the slaughter of entire flocks anytime it is found.",
      "It is not clear dropping cage-free laws will have a significant effect on egg prices that have peaked at an average of $4.95 per dozen because the farmers who collectively invested several billion dollars in making the switch can\u2019t easily go back to raising chickens packed together in massive barns that they already spent the money to convert.",
      "Even if all the cage-free laws went away, big corporations like McDonald\u2019s and Sodexo remain committed to buying only those kind of eggs, ensuring strong demand for cage-free eggs.",
      "University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said opening up Nevada to all kinds of eggs \u201ccould ease egg prices in Nevada very slightly,\u201d but that it might make prices worse elsewhere because supplies are so tight.",
      "But Nevada is going to give it a try even if California, Massachusetts, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan don't seem to be considering it. Arizona, Rhode Island and Utah also have cage-free laws on the books, but theirs won't take effect for at least a couple more years.",
      "Democratic Assemblymember Howard Watts III, who raises chickens in his Nevada backyard, advocated for the 2021 bill to promote the \u201cstandard of humane treatment\u201d of the animals. But the ongoing bird flu outbreak in the U.S. has caused egg prices to to hit a record high, and cage-free eggs are generally even more expensive.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that was not foreseen at that time was this major animal disease outbreak,\u201d Watts testified Tuesday. \u201cAs a result, there was no regulatory flexibility to suspend those requirements in the event of a major supply chain disruption.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo approved the legislation Thursday. Nevada Department of Agriculture Director J.J. Goicoechea is expected to authorize the 120-day suspension of the cage-free egg requirements within a day, according to Goicoechea's spokesperson Ciara Ressel.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate 30 days before we can see an impact at the grocery stores,\u201d Ressel said.",
      "This month\u2019s jump in egg prices was the biggest since the nation\u2019s last bird flu outbreak in 2015. The previous high was set two years ago when eggs were selling for $4.82 per dozen on average.",
      "The average prices mask just how bad it is in some places. Some Californians these days are shelling out $12.99 for a dozen, or more than a buck an egg. Some New York shops even started selling bundles of three eggs to help people who can't afford a full dozen.",
      "Nevada resident Nancy Wong said she has been \u201coutraged\u201d by egg prices in the state. \u201cWe have gone to the store and eggs have been either rationed or completely out,\u201d she said.",
      "The concern with the cage-free requirements is that only about 121 million of the 304 million chickens laying eggs nationwide are raised on cage-free farms, so the supply is limited.",
      "Many of the eggs those hens produce are promised to restaurant chains like McDonald's and Panera, food service giants like Sodexo and Aramark and grocers under long-term contracts that help keep prices down. But even when they do have to pay a premium, grocers sometimes lose money on eggs by selling them cheaply to try to get shoppers in the door.",
      "The number of cage-free chickens has steadily increased in recent years because of the laws and the pressure from the companies buying eggs, increasing exponentially from just 38 million at the start of 2017. But the United Egg Producers trade group has estimated it would take at least 226 million cage-free hens to meet all the demand for those eggs, and more customers are clamoring for them, so the supply is tight.",
      "The total flock of chickens nationwide used to number above 330 million before the bird flu outbreak began.",
      "Even as more egg farmers were converting to cage-free setups over the past decade, prices stayed between $1.40 and $2 per dozen most of the time with only the normal seasonal price spikes around Easter and Thanksgiving until this current bird flu outbreak began in early 2022.",
      "If bird flu outbreaks happen to hit cage-free farms hard, there are fewer eggs out there that can replace the lost ones. For example, out of the nearly 47 million birds slaughtered just since the start of December, more than 3 million of them were on five cage-free farms in California.",
      "Anytime birds must be killed, it takes months for a farm to resume producing eggs because of the time required to dispose of the carcasses, sanitize the barns and raise new chickens until they are about 5 months old and capable of laying eggs.",
      "California won\u2019t consider dropping its cage-free law in part because the rule came from a measure voters passed in 2018, so voters would have to approve any major changes.",
      "But there doesn't seem to be much support for changes in other states either.",
      "Michigan state Rep. Jerry Neyer, a dairy farmer and chair of the state House Agriculture Committee, said the idea that new cage-free laws are driving up egg prices is a \u201cmisconception.\u201d The Republican added that most farms already adapted to comply with the law, so dropping the mandate wouldn't cut costs.",
      "A bill to repeal Colorado\u2019s cage-free requirements, which just took effect on Jan. 1, was killed in its first committee vote last month. The sponsor, Republican state Rep. Ryan Gonzalez, argued that while the avian flu was a major factor in prices, the cage-free rules played a significant role. But the majority of lawmakers on the panel appeared skeptical.",
      "Jonathan Kuester, who runs the small Historic Wagner Farm with about 200 Red Star hens in Illinois just outside Chicago, said he doesn't think cage-free practices are the cause of the egg shortages.",
      "He acknowledged his farm is more vulnerable to a bird flu infection than a traditional farm where chickens are confined inside a barn that can be better protected. Kuester's birds roam free, where they might interact with ducks and geese that are the main carriers of the disease.",
      "\u201cThe egg shortage that people are seeing is a result of some fairly large flocks being euthanized, and so fewer chickens are currently laying than were three or four months ago,\" Kuester said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of a panic, too. People are suddenly buying eggs as quickly as they can, and so you see that shortage.\"",

      "Hong Kong plans to crack down on poor-quality subdivided flats are leaving many low-income residents uncertain about their future in one of the world\u2019s most expensive housing markets",
      "HONG KONG -- Jimmy Au\u2019s world shrinks to about the size of a parking space whenever she gets home.",
      "Her cramped Hong Kong home is one of four units carved out of what was once a single apartment. Most of the space is occupied by the bunk bed she shares with her husband and son, and their sleep is often disrupted by neighbors returning late or heading out early. Au\u2019s son often gets bruises bumping into things. Privacy is limited, with only a curtain separating the bathroom from the kitchen.",
      "But what troubles Au most about her home is that she might lose it. Hong Kong's government is planning to crack down on what it calls inadequate housing in subdivided apartments, mandating a minimum size and other baseline standards for homes like Au's. A public consultation period ended on Monday, and the government is aiming to pass the rules into law this year.",
      "The proposed rules leave many low-income residents like Au uncertain about their future in one of the world\u2019s most expensive housing markets.",
      "Au, a homemaker who moved from mainland China nine years ago, said her family pays about $460 a month in rent, about half of the income her husband makes from irregular renovation jobs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid the rent will get so high we can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Au said, sitting on the bed's lower bunk, surrounded by clothes, a fan and plastic storage drawers.",
      "Housing is a sensitive issue in Hong Kong, one of the world's least affordable cities. Some 7.5 million people live in a small territory that's mostly made up of steep slopes. Just 7%, or 80 square kilometers (30 square miles), of the city's total land is residential. The average price of an apartment of less than 40 square meters (430 square feet) last December ranged from about $13,800 to $16,800 per square meter, depending on the district.",
      "Beijing, which sees the city\u2019s housing problems as a driver of the 2019 anti-government protests, wants the city to phase out subdivided units by 2049. The government is also boosting the public housing supply, aiming to provide 189,000 flats over the next five years.",
      "But some 220,000 people rely on subdivided units, including migrants, workers, students and young professionals.",
      "Most subdivided homes are not far from the standards, the government said, but an estimated 33,000 units would need major renovations to meet them.",
      "The proposed rules would mandate a minimum size of at least eight square meters (86 square feet), a bar the government says it meant to leave room for low-priced housing. Every unit will also need to have a window, a toilet exclusively for the occupants' use, and a door to separate the toilet from other parts of the home, among other criteria.",
      "Landlords will have a grace period to renovate. After that, violations could lead to up to three years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of about $38,500.",
      "Security guard Fafa Ching has lived in multiple subdivided flats for over a decade. Her current unit costs about $490 per month and lacks even a bathroom sink, forcing her to collect water from the showerhead with a basin to wash her face. Her home will need renovation to meet proposed requirements for fire safety and separate electricity and water meters.",
      "Ching worries that upgraded homes will be too expensive for her.",
      "The government has said if necessary, it will offer assistance such as helping affected tenants to find other private accommodation or directly providing temporary shelter. A top official told the city\u2019s public broadcaster that transitional housing apartments are ready and assured that large-scale enforcement will happen only when proper resettlement arrangements are available.",
      "Chan Siu-ming, a professor at the City University of Hong Kong\u2019s social and behavioral sciences department, welcomed the government\u2019s taking steps to set minimum standards, but said its resettlement plans are inadequate.",
      "Chan said the impact could be wider than officials expect, and the city\u2019s supply of public and transitional housing may not meet needs. Low-income residents may also need help shouldering the cost of moving house, he said.",
      "As of last September, the average waiting time for a public flat is five and a half years, but it can take even longer than that. Ching said she's waited for eight years.",
      "In an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press, the government said it does not expect significant surges in rent as demand will drop with the increasing public housing supply. It reiterated that the rules will be implemented gradually to avoid causing panic.",
      "Chan added that some single people may be forced into even smaller dormitory-like \u201cbed spaces,\u201d which are not covered by the proposed rules. Bed spaces are widely considered to be Hong Kong's worst form of housing \u2014 partitioned areas in which residents get barely enough space to fit a single bed and some belongings. They are currently regulated under another law, the government said.",
      "Sze Lai-shan, the deputy director of the Society for Community Organization, a non-government organization, said some people have already been asked to move out of subdivided homes as landlords anticipate the policy.",
      "She suggested the government start registering substandard flats before the legislation comes into force to assess the residents\u2019 needs and consider expanding the eligibility for transitional housing. She also hoped the policy would eventually cover those living in tiny bed spaces.",

      "NEW YORK -- The daughters of one of the cofounders of Target are expressing their alarm and shock at the discounter's recent moves to roll back its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and of last month, the White House.",
      "In letters to the editor published Thursday in The Financial Times and the Los Angeles Times, Anne and Lucy Dayton said their father, Bruce Dayton, along with his four other brothers, expanded the Minneapolis department store into a massive brand that became Target that was built on two principles: a focus on the customer and the well-being of the community.",
      "Bruce Dayton died in 2015 at 97.",
      "\u201cWe are alarmed how quickly the business community has given in to the current administration\u2019s retaliatory threats,\" the daughters wrote. \u201cIt is not \u2018illegal\u2019 for a company to create a business model based on what it believes to be important ethical and business standards.\u201d",
      "They added that, \u201cBy cowering, Target and others are undermining the very principles that have made their companies a success.\u201d",
      "Target couldn\u2019t be immediately reached for comment.",
      "In late January, Target said the changes to its \u201cBelonging at the Bullseye\u201d strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.",
      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year.

      "It's the latest group of Amazon employees to side against union representation.",
      "Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina rejected a proposal to unionize, becoming the latest group of the company\u2019s employees to side against union representation.",
      "About three-quarters of employees at an Amazon fulfillment center in Garner, a town located near Raleigh, voted against joining a grassroots labor organization called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, the National Labor Relations Board announced Saturday.",
      "The federal labor agency said 2,447 workers cast ballots against union representation while 829 voted in favor of joining the independent union, which is made up of former and current Amazon workers. The NLRB had said 4,300 Amazon workers were eligible to cast ballots in the election, which took place Monday through Saturday.",
      "Rev. Ryan Brown, a former Amazon worker who co-founded the group, said Saturday, \u201cWe had already braced ourselves for a loss.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe knew that historically the tide was against us to have a win for several reasons,\u201d Brown said. \u201cOne, we\u2019re in the South. Two, the average worker that\u2019s in North Carolina knows nothing about a union and the benefits of a union and what a union could do for them.\u201d",
      "The outcome came just weeks after workers at a Whole Foods Market store in Pennsylvania voted to unionize, leading to the first successful entry of organized labor into the grocery chain, which Amazon owns. Following the union win, Whole Foods asked the NLRB to toss out the election results, arguing the voting process was tainted.",
      "In 2022, workers at an Amazon warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island unionized with Amazon Labor Union, which joined forces with the Teamsters last year. However, Amazon has objected to the election result and refused to negotiate over a contract.",
      "At the same time, the company has also been able to successfully fend off union victories at a second warehouse on Staten Island, as well as at facilities near Albany, New York, and in Bessemer, Alabama.",
      "In November, an NLRB administrative law judge ordered a third union election for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer after determining that the company committed six violations leading up to a rerun election in March 2022. That rerun was held after the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is seeking to represent Amazon workers in Bessemer, filed objections to the first election, which results in a union loss.",
      "Workers affiliated with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, or CAUSE, have been organizing at the North Carolina warehouse since January 2022. Co-founder Brown said in an interview last month he started organizing because he felt like Amazon was not providing workers adequate protections against COVID-19.",
      "The company said Saturday that Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting, such as safe and inclusive workplaces and competitive pay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re glad that our team in Garner was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,\" Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said in a written statement.",

    "story": [
      "During a time of pressure on public broadcasters, PBS says that it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion and firing the two executives who staffed it",
      "NEW YORK -- PBS says it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion to comply with President Donald Trump's executive order, firing the two executives brought on when the effort was begun in 2021.",
      "The move, eliminating the jobs held by Cecilia Loving and her associate Gina Leow, comes as public television and radio girds for a fight over federal funding likely to be more serious than it has faced in many years.",
      "Despite eliminating the DEI effort, PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Tuesday that \u201cwe were committed to telling the stories of all Americans before we had an office, and will continue to do it afterwards.\u201d",
      "Because PBS gets federal funding through U.S. Department of Education and National Science Foundation for its children's programming, the system's lawyers determined that it needed to comply with Trump's order, she said. The system gets some $535 million in general support from the government, about 16% of its budget, but because it is filtered through the private Corporation for Public Broadcasting, it's unclear whether that would require compliance.",
      "Some of PBS' 330 member stations have their own DEI efforts and receive CPB funding, so it will be up to them to decide what to do with their offices. \u201cWe're trying to encourage them to have lawyers look at their circumstances,\u201d Kerger told The Associated Press.",
      "The Free Press website reported that PBS initially considered transferring Loving and Leow to other jobs within the system. Kerger said that was thought about but rejected.",
      "The DEI office was concerned with more than just racial equity; much of its recent work went to making sure children with hearing issues had access to PBS programming, she said.",
      "Four years ago, PBS faced pressure from the opposite direction. More than 130 filmmakers sent a letter to the system saying that its relationship with documentarian Ken Burns came at the expense of others and that PBS showed a \u201csystemic failure to fulfill a mandate for a diversity of voices.\u201d",
      "With the Trump administration's current efforts at cutting federal spending, Kerger understands public broadcasting will be looked at closely. U.S. Sen. Mike Lee posted \u201clet's defund PBS and NPR\u201d on X Tuesday.",
      "That's not a new opinion. Republicans in the past have made similar calls, primarily because of a contention that news programming leans left. Ultimately, efforts to defund PBS usually fall short through pressure brought to bear on individual legislators from the hundreds of stations across the country.",
      "Kerger and NPR officials are expected to testify next month before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.",
      "\u201cI think it is different this time because so much is under scrutiny,\u201d Kerger said. \u201cI never assume that government funding will continue. I think we have to work hard each and every time these questions come up to make sure we are making the case of why this is important.\u201d",
      "She said it's a time where people assume \u201cthere is bias at play\u201d when they don't see their opinions expressed in news stories. Some people feel news efforts are too conservative, others too liberal. \u201cWe take that part of our work pretty seriously and if we miss sometime, we correct that,\u201d she said.",
      "Work done by local stations to alert citizens during the California wildfires and hurricanes in Florida are examples of things legislators need to be aware of, she said.",
      "\u201cI'm always an optimistic person,\u201d Kerger said, \u201cbut I think it's going to require a lot of conversations to see if we can hold on to a level of funding to enable our stations to continue.\"",

      "Valentine's day and the whiff of chocolate and cocoa are in the air",
      "BRUGES, Belgium -- St. Valentine chocolates always seek to show how deep your love is. This year, it might just also show how deep your pockets are.",
      "With the price of cocoa beans setting unprecedented records on the commodities market, it will certainly turn the gift of love into a bigger financial commitment than it once was. Turns out that if love is reputed to be eternal, a low price for cocoa, the essential ingredient in chocolate, is not.",
      "\u201cThe price increase of cocoa is absolutely spectacular, now for 2, 2\u00bd years,\u201d said Philippe de Sellier, the head of both Leonidas and Belgian chocolate federation Choprabisco. When it stood at less than $2,000 a ton in the summer of 2022, it really took over early last year and peaked at well over $12,000 during the Christmas season and has been hovering around the $10,000 mark since.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing unprecedented prices. They haven't been this high for the last 50 years,\u201d said Bart Van Besien, policy adviser of the Oxfam fair trade group. And the impact can be felt deep in chocolate gourmet country Belgium, where some of its 280 chocolate companies are left with a bleeding heart during Valentine's week.",
      "Dominque Persoone, owner of the famed Chocolate Line brand, still has plenty of beans to grind in his workshop in Bruges, but considers himself lucky, partly because he also has his own cocoa plantation in Mexico.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of colleagues who are really in trouble, because the price is too high,\" he said. \u201cIf you don't have good contacts, they just don't deliver anymore.\u201d",
      "Some just close for Valentine, he said, turning one of the few financial bonanzas of the year into a forced vacation, hoping that Easter, with its eggs and bunnies, will bring better tidings. Many chocolatiers can't go for the usual profit margins and turn all the extra costs of the cocoa prices over to their customers. Persoone said that his chocolates increased in price by 20% over the last year alone while de Selliers said that it depends very much from producer to producer.",
      "The shock of cocoa prices pretty much is a metaphorical perfect storm, mixing climate, disease, commodity speculation, the plight of farmers and social ascendency around the world into one heady mix.",
      "\u201cThe drop that has happened now in production was directly linked to climate change,\u201d said Van Besien, blaming changes in annual rain and drought patterns in western Africa that weakened the sensitive trees in key production areas. Persoone also said that the temperature differences between night and day increased in the small strip of land around the equator where the trees can thrive. Compounded by disease, it made sure too many harvests failed.",
      "At the same time across the world, populations lifted themselves out of poverty, middle classes expanded in places like China and the craving for the delicacy increased.",
      "And making matters worse, the years of slumping prices for the beans simply drove farmers off the land to look for a better future in the cities and pushed production further down. De Selliers said that \u201c60 % of cocoa comes from Ivory Coast and Ghana and these farmers have to make a better living. It is extremely important.\u201d",
      "Persoone concurred: \u201cWe didn't pay enough to have an honest price for the farmers.\u201d",
      "So, strangely enough, low prices then, help cause high prices now.",
      "\u201cThe big irony in the cocoa industry is that farmers are now getting a fair price at the moment they are abandoning cocoa farming,\u201d Van Besien said. \u201cWith the price they are getting right now, they could have invested in sustainable practices. They could have sent their children to school.\u201d",
      "Does it mean a premier box of chocolates is a guilty pleasure on Valentine's Day?",
      "\u201cYeah, the guilt question .... It's one that always works,\u201d said Van Besien, the fair trade expert. \u201cWe could not survive if we would be thinking about these things all the time,\u201d arguing that legislation should trump consumer emotions.",
      "\u201cWe should have laws that make buying cocoa below the cost of the production something illegal. And it should not be up to the consumer to make this decision,\u201d he said. Both de Selliers and Persoone hope that if the prices drop down again, they stay around the $5,000 or $6,000 mark.",
      "\u201cI really, really hope the money goes to the farmers,\u201d Persoone said.",
      "So in the meantime, despite the price hikes, the chocolate shouldn't leave too bitter a taste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a small luxury that most people still can afford,\u201d Persoone said. \"I hope it stays like this.\u201d",

      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is on the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration",
      "BRUSSELS -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday made the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration, as the allies wait to learn how much military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine's government.",
      "Hegseth held talks with U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey, before a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Hegseth's predecessor, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, set up the forum for drumming up arms and ammunition for Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Over nearly three years, around 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance. But the meeting this week was convened by another country for the first time: the United Kingdom. All previous gatherings of the forum were chaired by the United States.",
      "No decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is called.",
      "Hegseth wasn't expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine.",
      "His trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won't stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders if he wins, and that Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to quickly end the war. He\u2019s complained that it's costing American taxpayers too much money. He has suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals, energy and other resources.",
      "Some U.S. allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that aren't favorable to Ukraine. On top of that, Trump appears to believe that European countries should take responsibility for Ukraine's security going forward.",
      "Washington's 31 NATO allies also want to hear what Trump's new administration has in store for the world\u2019s biggest security organization. Trump traumatized his European partners during his first term in office by threatening not to defend any member that doesn\u2019t meet NATO guidelines for military spending.",
      "NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any ally must be considered an attack on them all and met with a collective response. Membership is considered to be the ultimate security guarantee, and it\u2019s one that Ukraine is trying to secure.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s security needs and defense spending will be discussed on Thursday. European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year the target of spending 2% of gross domestic product.",
      "However, a third of members still haven't reached that threshold, and Trump is almost certain to target them again. Recently, Trump called for NATO members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, a level that no member has reached so far \u2014 not even Poland, which is the closest, spending more than 4% and expected to approach 5% this year.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Germany on Tuesday, Hegseth wouldn't commit to having the U.S. increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP. Hegseth said that he believes that the U.S. should spend more than it did under the Biden administration and \u201cshould not go lower than 3 percent.\u201d",
      "He said any final decision would be up to Trump, but added that \u201cwe live in fiscally constrained times\u201d and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. The U.S. spends about 3.3% of GDP on defense.",
      "NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-26.",

      "North Carolina House members have advanced a Republican package to boost state recovery funding after Hurricane Helene by another $500 million",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina House members advanced Wednesday a Republican package to boost state recovery funding after Hurricane Helene as committees fleshed out details on how best to spend another $500 million to address the historic flooding.",
      "The House's budget-writing committee voted for the latest spending proposal, which would emphasize repairs for damaged homes, private bridges and roads, assistance to farmers who lost crops and rebuilding infrastructure adjacent used by small businesses.",
      "GOP House leaders had unveiled a version last week, but several amendments adjusted the measure in a special Helene recovery committee on Tuesday. A House floor vote is expected next week, said Rep. John Bell, the House rules chairman and co-chairman of the recovery committee.",
      "The package remains less than half of the $1.07 billion that new Democratic Gov. Josh Stein sought in new recovery spending earlier this month from legislators.",
      "Stein's package contains several initiatives the House plan currently lacks, including money to recompense local governments in the mountains for lost or spent revenues and for two business grant programs designed to help small businesses directly.",
      "Senate GOP leaders will have their own competing spending ideas that will figure into negotiations with House counterparts. Both Stein and Republican lawmakers want to get more Helene spending out the door early this year to address immediate needs. Additional funds are expected in the two-year state budget that would take effect July 1.",
      "The legislature already has appropriated close to $1 billion since last fall for Helene aid in the weeks after it made landfall in late September.",
      "\u201cThis is just the next step in this process,\u201d House Speaker Destin Hall told Tuesday's committee meeting. \"Somebody asked me earlier, \u2018How many bills are we going to need to do this?\u2019 And my answer is \u2014 and I know you all feel the same \u2014 it\u2019s going to be as many as it takes for us to get it done to rebuild western North Carolina.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported that Helene damaged 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads, bridges and culverts. State officials projected the storm caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs.",
      "Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "The state House proposal seeks to maximize federal matching funds, avoid mistakes from previous storm recovery efforts and prevent the distribution of too much money to programs ill-equipped to get it out the door, Bell said.",
      "\"This body is very strategic in what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Bell said Wednesday.",
      "Adjustments that House Republicans made this week to their preliminary bill included shifting $75 million to create a state Agriculture Department program to address agricultural crop and infrastructure losses.",
      "Another $60 million initially earmarked for repairs of state facilities would be used for other purposes. Nearly all of it \u2014 $55 million \u2014 would help small businesses, although not in the form of direct payments, as Stein and other Democrats want.",
      "Instead, the proposed infrastructure grant program would allocate money to local governments to repair \u201cqualifying infrastructure needs\u201d like utilities, broadband and sidewalks that would benefit small businesses trying to reemerge from the storm. Bell said Wednesday that a grant program could be open to abuses by businesses that aren't located specifically in the damaged region.",
      "With Republicans falling one seat short of retaining a veto-proof majority in the General Assembly after the November election, Stein and Democratic allies may be able to yield more leverage to fashion a package to their liking.",
      "For example, Democratic Rep. Eric Ager of Buncombe County offered an amendment Tuesday to create a direct payment program to small businesses that Stein sought, running it through the state Revenue Department.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re losing businesses in western North Carolina every day and we\u2019ve got to find a solution,\u201d Ager said, adding that it \u201cwould really go a long way in keeping some folks solvent through to the summer when business picks back up again.\u201d",
      "While Ager pulled his amendment before a vote because earlier committee action took away his funding source, Bell suggested to Ager and later to reporters that new language to help small businesses may be considered.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 04:05:51 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "President Donald Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax. If that sounds familiar, it\u2019s because he did pretty much the same thing during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s original metals tariffs gave America\u2019s struggling steel and aluminum producers some relief from intense global competition, allowing them to charge higher prices. In anticipation of the new tariffs, shares of steel and aluminum producers climbed Monday. Nucor rose 5.6%, Cleveland-Cliffs jumped 17.9% and Alcoa ticked up 2.2%.",
      "But the tariffs took a toll last time, too, damaging U.S. relations with key allies and driving up costs for \u201cdownstream\u2019\u2019 U.S. producers that buy steel and aluminum and use them to manufacture goods.",
      "Timothy Zimmerman is CEO of one of those downstream companies: Mitchell Metal Products in Merrill, Wisconsin. And he still has bad memories of those times.",
      "\u201cWe were significantly impacted,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe challenges we faced were unprecedented -- rapid inflationary impacts from domestic steel producers. We saw steel prices rise within a few months about 70% over what they had been ... Our (steel) suppliers simply broke contracts and gave us an option: Take this or take nothing.\u2019\u2019",
      "But Mitchell Metal Products was locked into contracts with its own customers \u2014 a wide range of businesses from furniture makers to telecommunications firms -- that didn\u2019t allow it to pass along all or part of the higher cost. His company\u2019s profit margins were squeezed, and it ended up losing business to European rivals that didn\u2019t have to contend with the fallout from Trump\u2019s steel tariffs.",
      "The overall economic impact on the United States was limited then \u2013 and is likely to be limited again -- because steel and aluminum imports amount to barely a ripple in the almost $30 trillion U.S. economy.",
      "Still, the new taxes on foreign steel and aluminum and Trump\u2019s other import tax plans \u2013 including his promise to raise American tariffs to match those charged by other countries -- are likely \u201cto boost U.S. inflation and weigh on global growth this year,\u2019\u2019 Jennifer McKeown and Hamad Hussain of Capital Economics wrote Monday.",
      "The steel and aluminum tariffs would hit U.S. allies. Canada is the No. 1 supplier of foreign steel and aluminum to the United States. Mexico is the No. 3 steel supplier, and Japan and South Korea are also major steel exporters to the U.S.",
      "China is widely seen as source of the world steel industry\u2019s problems. Chinese overproduction has flooded the world with steel and kept prices low, hurting steelmakers in the United States and elsewhere. But the U.S. already uses trade barriers to keep out all but a trickle of Chinese steel. China accounted for less than 2% of U.S. steel imports last year, making it the No. 10 supplier of steel to the U.S., according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group.",
      "In slapping duties on steel and aluminum nearly seven years ago, Trump reached into the federal government\u2019s tariff toolkit and pulled out Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Section 232 gives the president the power to impose tariffs on other countries national security grounds.",
      "The 2018 tariffs \u2014 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum \u2014 provoked outrage in Canada and Mexico, U.S. neighbors and allies that resented being hit with trade sanctions and labeled as threats to U.S. national security.",
      "The steel and aluminum tariffs also drew retaliation as U.S. trading partners hit back with taxes on U.S. exports from Kentucky bourbon to Levi\u2019s jeans.",
      "By making foreign steel costlier, the tariffs allowed U.S. steelmakers to raise prices and encouraged them to keep mills running and to invest in new capacity.",
      "But the tariffs hammered downstream businesses like Zimmerman\u2019s that had to pay the higher prices. In 2021, production at downstream companies dropped by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs, canceling out the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, according to a 2023 study by the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency that investigates trade disputes.",
      "In 2020, researchers from Harvard University and the University of California, Davis, found that the tariffs created 1,000 jobs \u2013 but reduced employment elsewhere by 75,000. When the tariffs hit seven years ago, Mitchell Metal Products employed a peak of 102 workers. It had to cut its payrolls by leaving openings unfilled and weeding out some workers. The company now employs about 75 people.",
      "Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that Trump\u2019s first-term trade wars, including his tariffs on most Chinese imports, were costly to American industry.",
      "\u201cThe net effect of all these tariffs at that time \u2014 on China, aluminum, steel, plus retaliation \u2014 was to reduce U.S. manufacturing unemployment,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI\u2019m expecting the same thing this time around.\u2019\u2019",
      "The 2018 metals tariffs were partially eased. For some countries, they were dropped. For some, they were replaced with import quotas. On Monday, Trump removed all exceptions and exemptions on the original tariffs and upped the levy on aluminum from 10% to 25%.",
      "Zimmerman is bracing for the new tariffs to hit. \u201cAlready last week several large (steel) mills operating in the United States announced price increases in anticipation of the tariffs, not due to increased demand,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI think the domestic producers will work to do the same thing, or very close to the same thing, as what happened in 2018.\u2019\u2019",
      "This time, he said, Mitchell Metal Products will seek to be more pro-active in getting its customers to absorb some of the higher costs. Otherwise, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a healthy place to be as a company.\u2019\u2019",

      "Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have a longer road than they imagined to that line. Both were in contention early, and both faded in their own way with a series of mistakes, each with a three-putt from the 12-foot range. They were five behind.",
      "Rodgers was at 8-under 208, one shot ahead of Denny McCarty (71). Ludvig Aberg, who had an ace on the par-3 third hole, had a 70 and was another shot behind.",
      "Rodgers won 11 times at Stanford, same as Woods (and later Maverick McNealy). Now he is one round away from Woods, the tournament host who is likely to be at Torrey Pines on Sunday, presenting him the trophy. Woods withdrew when his mother died last week.",
      "But for Rodgers, 18 holes can feel like a marathon, especially on a beast like the South course at Torrey Pines.",
      "The course did a number on Scheffler and McIlroy.",
      "Scheffler, the world's No. 1 player, tied Davis Thompson for the lead with a birdie on the fifth and had the easily reachable par-5 sixth ahead of him. But he hit 7-wood from a fairway bunker into the crowd and then three-putted from just inside 15 feet for bogey.",
      "He also took two chips from thick rough near the par-5 ninth green and made bogey, took double bogey with a tee shot into the hazard on the 14th and wound up with a 76, his highest score in nearly three years.",
      "He was five shots behind with McIlroy, whose round of 74 was more of a slow bleed until he three-putted from 12 feet on the par-3 16th.",
      "Scheffler and McIlroy will be paired together in the final round, teeing off a lot earlier than both of them would have liked.",
      "The first day of full sunshine allowed for some good scoring early before a strong Pacific breeze kicked in. Tony Finau chipped in three times on his way to a 67. He started the day nine shots behind and will be in the penultimate group Sunday, four shots back.",
      "Also four back were Patrick Cantlay (68), Tommy Fleetwood (69) and Thompson, the 36-hole leader who was holding his own until a 40 on the back nine gave him a 76.",
      "McCarthy, steady through a roller coast day for so many others, also is going for his first PGA Tour win. But far more was expected from Rodgers, who grew up in amateur golf with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas and has watched them pile up tour wins and majors.",
      "He has switched his thinking from playing with expectations to simply trying to perform.",
      "\u201cIt felt like early in my career with the amateur resume that I had, I felt like there was a lot expected of myself internally,\" he said. \"And it was something where when immediate success, immediate wins didn\u2019t come straight away, it was kind of fighting who I saw myself to be.",
      "\u201cSo instead of playing with a monkey on your back that gets bigger and bigger over time when it doesn\u2019t happen, I\u2019m trying to play from a perspective that feels fresh and new and exciting and full of opportunity. Because that\u2019s what this game is, and I have a great one tomorrow.\u201d",
      "The bogey on the 18th \u2014 his gap wedge came out softer than he imagined from the first cut and barely reached the green before rolling down the hill \u2014 was his only blemish. Still, he had a 54-hole lead for only the third time in his 11 years on tour.",
      "His best work came on the back nine, starting with a 4-iron he laced into 15 feet for birdie on the 504-yard 12th hole, and a 3-wood onto the green at the par-5 13th. Only three other players hit that green in two.",
      "Rodgers also holed a 40-foot birdie putt across the 17th before his bogey at the end.",
      "Aberg played alongside Rodgers and was impressed with what he saw.",
      "\u201cHe played amazing and he was great off the tee,\u201d Aberg said. \u201cYou can be rewarded and have a lot of good chances into the greens, but as soon as you start missing the fairways, it gets pretty difficult. It\u2019s a great golf course, it\u2019s a U.S. Open golf course, and it definitely played that way today.\u201d",

      "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has a message to those Dallas Mavericks fans who are still angry, two weeks later: He feels your pain",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has a message to those Dallas Mavericks fans who are still angry, two weeks later: He feels your pain.",
      "That said, he's also sure that the Mavericks believe that their decision to trade Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis was \u2014 in their minds, at least \u2014 the best possible move for the franchise.",
      "Silver, in his annual address at All-Star weekend on Saturday, said he had no advance word that the trade was looming and that he was surprised like everyone else. He also said he wasn't going to second-guess Dallas' decision.",
      "\u201cI can say one thing for sure: Whether or not history will ultimately judge this as a smart trade, they did what they thought was in the best interest of their organization,\" Silver said. \"I have absolutely no knowledge or belief there were any ulterior motives, no doubt in my mind that the Dumont-Adelson families bought that team to keep it in Dallas. I have no doubt whatsoever that they\u2019re committed to the long-term success of that franchise.\u201d",
      "The Doncic-for-Davis trade sent shock waves across the NBA. It was the first midseason trade where All-NBA players were swapped for one another, and the angry fallout from fans in Dallas over trading a 25-year-old superstar and global icon hasn't exactly subsided.",
      "\u201cI'm empathetic,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI understand it.\u201d",
      "San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama also understands how some Mavericks fans feel, even though he plays for the in-state rival Spurs.",
      "\u201cWhat really strikes me is how the Mavs\u2019 fans are hurting, how they feel,\u201d Wembanyama said Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s really something that I think was a really strong emotion. But otherwise, I think the Mavs are still contenders. The Lakers are contenders. It\u2019s very competitive. They traded for very good players. ... But two weeks after, it\u2019s still the craziest trade I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "Further adding to the disappointment or frustration for some Dallas fans is the fact that Davis got hurt in his debut game with the Mavericks, one of many big-man injuries the team is currently grappling with.",
      "\u201cTime will tell whether it was a smart trade,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut they should believe in their organization.\u201d",
      "In other topics covered by Silver on Saturday:",
      "All-Star Saturday last year was highlighted by the 3-point contest between Stephen Curry and Sabrina Ionescu.",
      "Everyone left that night indicating that it would come back in 2025. But it didn't happen \u2014 and Silver said the reason is simply that it might have been too good to do twice.",
      "\u201cLast year was so magical, that competition, that it started to feel forced. And I think there was concern from all of us that we just weren\u2019t feeling it,\" Silver said.",
      "A few days after an arbitration panel ruled that ownership transfer of the Minnesota Timberwolves to Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez \u2014 who would get the majority stake for $1.5 billion \u2014 must continue as originally planned, Silver said the league is waiting to see what happens next.",
      "\u201cMy expectation is that will move forward. But first, Glen Taylor does have a decision to make as to whether to appeal that arbitration decision,\" Silver said. \"I mean, that\u2019s Glen\u2019s decision to make. I haven\u2019t talked to him directly about that. I think, though, that A-Rod, certainly Marc Lore, are well-known to the league at this point. They\u2019ve already been vetted and approved as minority owners. I think they understood that the league had no role in this arbitration. That was something they had agreed to as part of their purchase agreement.\u201d",
      "Silver said he sees no reason why the sale wouldn't be approved, but stopped short of speaking for the Board of Governors and the decision they would have to make to get the sale across the finish line.",
      "A week after a trade between Charlotte and the Lakers fell through because of the results of Hornets center Mark Williams' physical, Silver said the Hornets have not filed a formal appeal with the league.",
      "The Lakers rescinded the trade.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s see what Charlotte decides to do here,\" Silver said. \"But I think either way, it\u2019s gotten our attention. We understand that in the back and forth of teams and trades that the extent we can reduce uncertainty, that\u2019s a positive thing.\u201d",
      "The NBA hasn't hidden from the fact that their television ratings aren't where the league wants them to be, but Silver sees progress.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll begin with the state of our ratings right now as they\u2019re conventionally measured,\" Silver said. \"They\u2019re slightly down from last season. We had some weakness early in the season. We rebounded. The ratings are heading up right now. So, I see that as very positive.\u201d",
      "The NBA also doesn't solely look at ratings. The league's footprint on social media is growing and is at \u201crecord popularity,\u201d Silver said, and he said that the TV numbers don't show the interest from podcasts and other forms of new media.",
      "\u201cNow, how do you blend all those things together? I think that's the really tough question,\u201d Silver said.",

      "The coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy exclamation point on America's winter of repeated polar vortex invasions, meteorologists warn. And it will stay frozen there all next week.",
      "Different weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole not just into the United States, but also Europe, several meteorologists tell The Associated Press.",
      "This will be the 10th time this winter that the polar vortex \u2014 which keeps the coldest of Arctic air penned in at the top of the world \u2014 stretches like a rubber band to send some of that big chill south, said Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. In a normal winter, it happens maybe two or three times.",
      "This winter, with record snow in New Orleans and drought and destructive wildfires in Southern California, has not been normal.",
      "The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains Saturday and then stick around all next week. The cold will likely concentrate east of the Rockies with only the far American west and central and southern Florida exempted, meteorologists said.",
      "On Tuesday, expect the Lower 48 states to have an average low of 16.6 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.6 Celsius), and then plunge to 14 degrees (minus 10 Celsius) on Wednesday, calculated private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist.",
      "Sometime next week, 89% of the contiguous United States will be below the freezing mark and 27% of the Lower 48 will be below zero (minus 18 degrees Celsius), according to National Weather Service forecasts.",
      "Meteorologists expect strong winds to make the cold feel even worse. Every U.S. state but Hawaii, California and Florida have some or all parts forecast to have a good chance of windchills of 20 degrees or below sometime next week, the National Weather Service predicted.",
      "Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa will have \u201cprobably the most impressive\u201d cold, with temperatures as much as 35 degrees (19 degrees Celsius) below what's normal for this time of year, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist at the weather service's Weather Prediction Center. NOAA weather models predict Wednesday lows below zero in Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.",
      "Some storms \u2014 with flooding, heavy snow or even a nor'easter \u2014 could hit during next week's prolonged cold outbreak, but details on those aren't certain yet, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cEverything, all the stars align, all the wind directions in the atmosphere are dragging the cold polar air out of the Canadian Arctic,\u201d Maue said. \u201cIt\u2019s the depths of winter. Everything signals extreme biting, winter cold. Obviously this isn\u2019t the first polar vortex episode of the winter, but it looks to be the most severe.\u201d",
      "A stretched polar vortex like this one happens lower in the atmosphere and is different than when the polar vortex has sudden warming, weakens and all the cold air escapes south and out of the poles, Cohen said. During stretching events, the polar vortex remains in place and strong, but it also just pulls and bends. Stretch outbreaks are usually slightly milder than the big polar escape events and often hit the United States, not Europe.",
      "Meteorologists are going to want to study why this stretching is happening so often this year, but it could just be natural randomness, said Laura Ciasto, a meteorologist at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center who specializes in the polar vortex.",
      "\u201cWhat we're observing right now is interesting, but not unprecedented,\u201d said Martin Stendel, a scientist at the National Center for Climate Research in Denmark.",
      "Another factor adding to the polar vortex stretching is a big blob of high pressure in the upper atmosphere over Greenland. It's moving west and will push the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that moves weather systems such as storms \u2014 into a pattern that causes polar air to plunge and stay there, Cohen said.",
      "Human-caused climate change may be making the jet stream wavier and more likely to be stuck in that wavy pattern, one of the factors involved, Stendel said.",
      "There haven't been many winters like this in the past to help meteorologists forecast what will happen next and when the cold will finally go away, Maue said.",
      "Despite the unusually cold winter across the U.S., the world remains in an overall warming pattern. Earth's average overall temperature set yet another monthly heat record in January. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial times.",

    "story": [
      "The man who led a NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 space shuttle Challenger explosion has died",
      "William Ray Lucas, who led the NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, has died. Lucas was 102.",
      "Lucas died Monday at his home in Huntsville, Alabama, according to an obituary published Friday by Laughlin Service Funeral Home in Huntsville. A funeral service has been set for March 1 on what would have been his 103rd birthday, funeral director Bryan Peek said Saturday.",
      "Lucas was director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville when the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It was the deadliest U.S. space flight disaster at that time.",
      "The explosion killed all seven crew members, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, who had been tapped to become the first U.S. civilian to travel to space. Her inclusion on the flight meant thousands of schoolchildren across the country were watching the Challenger's launch and witnessed the televised disaster in real time.",
      "A presidential commission charged with investigating the cause of the explosion pointed to the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets as the likely culprit and criticized NASA managers for not taking safety concerns surrounding the rockets more seriously. The Marshall center had supervised development of the rockets.",
      "Lucas pushed back on the criticism, telling reporters a month after the explosion that it was too soon to pinpoint the cause of the explosion, adding, \u201cI think it was a sound decision to launch.\"",
      "But within months he had resigned, just days ahead of the release of a commission report blaming faulty design of the booster rockets.",
      "The explosion and resulting shakeup within NASA overshadowed what was an otherwise stellar career for Lucas, who was born and raised in rural western Tennessee and graduated from high school in 1939 as the class valedictorian. He earned a bachelor of science degree from Memphis State College, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later earned a doctorate in metallurgy from Vanderbilt University.",
      "Lucas began his career in the guided missile development division of the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville. He became a charter member of the Marshall Space Flight Center when it was established in 1960 before rising through the ranks to become its director in 1974."

    "story": [
      "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.",
      "Trump said that he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It's unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yermak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally doesn't freeze military support. That would be devastating for the country, which has been at war for nearly three years after Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for more than 20 critical raw materials and concluded that if the country joins the 27-nation EU, it could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It's unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

      "A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration passive acoustic recorder located about 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) away from the implosion site picked up the sound, U.S. Coast Guard officials said in a statement. The recording became public on Feb. 7.",

      "The implosion of the Titan killed all five people on board and set off a Coast Guard investigation and international debate about the future of private deep-sea travel. The Titan vanished on its way to the wreck of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean, setting off a five-day search that ended with authorities telling the world that the vessel had been destroyed with no survivors.",
      "Concerns were raised after the implosion because of the Titan's unconventional design and its creator's refusal to submit to independent safety checks. OceanGate, the Washington state-based company that owned the submersible, suspended operations in July 2023.",
      "Titan operator Stockton Rush, who co-founded OceanGate, was among those who died in the implosion. The implosion also killed two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.",
      "A Coast Guard panel performing a lengthy investigation into the submersible disaster heard two weeks of testimony last September.

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 The Italian government denied Wednesday that it had spied on journalists and migrant activists using spyware but said it would cooperate with an investigation into \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d after at least seven Italian cellphones were apparently hacked with military-grade surveillance technology.",
      "Meta\u2019s WhatsApp messaging service informed dozens of people across the European Union on Jan. 31 that they had been targeted in a spyware attack using technology from Israeli cyber firm Paragon Solutions.",
      "In a statement provided by Meta\u2019s Italy press office, WhatsApp said it had disrupted what it called \u201ca spyware campaign by Paragon that targeted several users, including journalists and members of civil society.\u201d",
      "After The Guardian newspaper reported the story, the Italian government confirmed on Feb. 5 that at least seven Italian cellphones were involved and that it had activated the National Cybersecurity Agency, which reports to the premier\u2019s office, to investigate.",
      "It said other targeted phones had numbers from Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.",
      "Speaking to parliament\u2019s lower chamber Wednesday, Cabinet Minister Luca Ciriani confirmed that the Italian government for many years has had a contract with Paragon Solutions to provide intelligence-gathering capabilities to fight terrorism and other threats to national security.",
      "But he insisted that the law was \u201crigorously respected\u201d and denied the government had used the technology to spy on journalists illegally. He threatened legal action against any claims to the contrary.",

      "The Guardian has reported that Paragon halted its contract with Italy after the spyware attack became public, but Ciriani said the contract with the intelligence services continues. That suggests that a second contract, perhaps with another law enforcement agency or police department, was canceled. Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper has said Paragon had two contracts with Italy for Graphite, a military-grade surveillance technology capable of hacking into encrypted smartphones.",
      "There was no immediate response to an email seeking comment sent to Paragon Solutions.",
      "Among the Italians targeted were Luca Casarini, the head of the migrant rescue group Mediterranea Saving Humans, and Francesco Cancellato, editor of the Fanpage new website, both of whose work has been critical of the government.",
      "Both confirmed in interviews Wednesday that they had been informed by WhatsApp on Jan. 31 that their phones had been infected with the spyware. The message they received from WhatsApp suggested they contact Citizen Lab, based out of the Munk School at the University of Toronto, which has for years played a leading role in exposing state-backed hackers.",
      "Cancellato said he believed he had been targeted by hackers who wanted to see what investigative stories Fanpage was developing. He declined to speculate on who it might have been. Fanpage has published undercover reports in which journalists infiltrated the youth branch of Premier Giorgia Meloni's party and exposed neofascist behavior.",
      "Casarini, for his part, heads an aid group that rescues migrants in the Mediterranean and has criticized the Italian government's support of Libya's patrols of its coasts to prevent smugglers\u2019 boats from leaving."

      "NEW YORK -- Google's online calendar has removed default references for a handful of holidays and cultural events \u2014 with users noticing that mentions of Pride and Black History Month, as well as other observances, no longer appear in their desktop and mobile applications.",
      "The omissions gained attention online over the last week, particularly around upcoming events that are no longer automatically listed. But Google says it made the change midway through last year.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\u201d for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\u201cMaintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn\u2019t scalable or sustainable,\u201d Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\u201d",
      "Google did not provide a full list of the cultural events it added prior to last year's change \u2014 and therefore no longer appear by default today.",
      "But social media users and product experts posting to online community boards have pointed to several holidays and cultural observances that they're not seeing anymore. In addition to the first days of Pride Month and Black History Month, that includes the start of Indigenous Peoples Month and Hispanic Heritage Month, as well as Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Verge first reported on some of these omissions last week.",
      "Norway-based Time and Date AS, which operates timeanddate.com, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. The website shows numerous country-by-country lists of holidays and observances from around the world \u2014 some of which include cultural awareness events like Pride and Black History Month \u2014 but those specific to public holidays are more limited.",
      "Separate from this Calendar shift, Google has also gained attention over its more recent decision to change the names of the Gulf of Mexico and Denali on Google Maps \u2014 following orders from President Donald Trump to rename the body of water bordering the U.S., Mexico and Cuba the Gulf of America, as well as revert the title of America\u2019s highest mountain peak back to Mt. McKinley.",
      "\u201cWe have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\u201d Google said last month. The company added that its maps will reflect any updates to the Geographic Names Information System, a database of more than 1 million geographic features in the U.S.",
      "Google confirmed Monday that the Gulf of America name had gone into effect. Google Maps users in the U.S. now only see the Gulf of America name, whereas those in other countries see both names. Denali, however, still appears on both Google Maps and the GNIS.",
      "And the new names on Google Maps aren't the only change the company has made following recent actions from the Trump administration. Last week, Google outlined plans to scrap some of its diversity hiring targets \u2014 joining a growing list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Google's move notably came in the wake of an executive order aimed, in part, at pressuring government contractors to end DEI initiatives. As a federal contractor, Google said it was evaluating required changes.",
      "By Tuesday, both Apple and Microsoft\u2019s Bing made the switch from Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America on their maps."

      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman\u2019s push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company",
      "PARIS -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.",
      "\"We are not for sale,\u201d Altman said Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.",
      "Musk\u2019s bid, announced Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a nonprofit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.",
      "\u201cOpenAI has a mission,\u201d Altman told France\u2019s AI minister in an on-stage discussion Tuesday mobbed by tech industry workers and investors. \u201cWe are an unusual organization and we have this mission of making AGI benefit all humanity. And we are here to do that.\u201d",
      "Its stated aim since its founding in 2015 is to safely build futuristic, better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk, an early investor and board member, quit OpenAI in 2018 after an internal power struggle left Altman in charge.",
      "Their public feud has escalated over the past year as Musk sued OpenAI and is working to grow his own AI company called xAI, part of a business empire that includes Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X. Musk also now holds power as a top adviser to President Donald Trump in reshaping the U.S. government, and has publicly questioned OpenAI\u2019s Trump-backed private investment project for building AI data centers in the United States.",
      "The offer complicates OpenAI's plan to shift its structure away from its nonprofit roots to a company beholden to shareholders.",
      "OpenAI's nonprofit board will need to consider Musk's offer. It's not Altman alone who can accept or reject it, though the chair of the board, Bret Taylor, echoed Altman's approach and declared \u201cOpenAI is not for sale\u201d at a Wall Street Journal event Tuesday in Palo Alto, California.",
      "Taylor said Musk's move was \u201clargely a distraction\u201d from the board's fiduciary duty to its mission.",
      "As a nonprofit board, said Taylor, \u201cour job is very simple, which is to basically evaluate every strategic decision of the organization through that one test, which is, \u2018Does this actually further the mission of ensuring AGI benefits humanity?\u2019 And I have a hard time seeing how this would.\u201d",
      "The board will need to weigh not just the value of the company's assets but also the value of controlling the company developing this technology. Musk's offer also seems to set a floor for how much the nonprofit should be paid if it does relinquish control of its subsidiaries.",
      "Rose Chan Loui, executive director for the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits at UCLA Law, said the board should consider the credibility of Musk's offer, including if he and his investors will pay in cash. And they should consider whether a new board under the control of Musk and other investors would be independent and what guarantees they can give about protecting its public mission.",
      "Musk's $44 billion Twitter takeover in 2022 also started with an unsolicited offer and a legal fight with Twitter's board, which was also led by Taylor, a former Facebook and Salesforce executive. However, taking over OpenAI would be more complicated because of its charitable purpose.",
      "\u201cThere is a legally binding purpose,\u201d said Jill Horwitz, a professor at UCLA School of Law. \u201cIt is the promise that was made to the public when OpenAI, the nonprofit, was formed. That promise is legally enforceable.\u201d",
      "The sudden popularity of ChatGPT two years ago brought worldwide fame and new commercial possibilities to OpenAI and also heightened internal turmoil over the future of the organization and the advanced AI it was trying to develop. Its nonprofit board fired Altman in late 2023. He came back days later with a new board.",
      "OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit purpose, as defined most recently in 2020, is \u201c(to) ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity, including by conducting and/or funding artificial intelligence research.\u201d",
      "The question is, can it do that if it sells its assets and loses control of the company developing this technology?",
      "\u201cTo make the promise to the world that you are bound by a legal purpose and to build with that promise, including telling your investors not to expect any returns and to think of your investments as more akin to a donation than an investment,\" said Horwitz. \"And then to say once you\u2019ve gotten big enough, \u2019You know what? We\u2019d like to own this.' That seems like a real violation of the promise.\u201d",
      "Musk sued OpenAI last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab that would benefit the public good. A lawyer for Musk has said he invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018.",
      "Lawyers for OpenAI and Musk faced off in a California federal court last week as a judge weighed Musk\u2019s request for a court order that would block OpenAI's for-profit conversion.",
      "The judge hasn\u2019t yet ruled on Musk\u2019s request but in the courtroom said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn\u2019t intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its planned transition. But she also suggested Musk had plausible enough arguments to take to a jury trial.",
      "Along with Musk and xAI, others backing the bid announced Monday include Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund, and firms run by Musk allies Ari Emanuel and Jon Lonsdale.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement that if Altman and OpenAI\u2019s current board \u201care intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time.\u201d",
      "Altman told employees this week that OpenAI's structure \u201censures that no individual can take control of OpenAI\u201d and he has sought to characterize Musk's tactics as those of a competitor trying to catch up.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s probably just trying to slow us down. He obviously is a competitor,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg TV at the Paris summit on Tuesday.",
      "Continuing their deeply personal feud, Altman said Musk is probably not a \u201chappy person.\u201d",
      "\u201cProbably his whole life is from a position of insecurity. I feel for the guy,\u201d Altman said.",
      "\u2014-",
      "O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island, and Beaty from Seattle.",
      "\u2014-",

      "Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying numerous investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles",
      "WASHINGTON -- Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying a crushing number of federal investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles.",
      "Now, Musk\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump means many of those federal headaches could vanish within weeks or months.",
      "On the potential chopping block: crash investigations into Tesla\u2019s partially automated vehicles; a Justice Department criminal probe examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars\u2019 self-driving capabilities; and a government mandate to report crash data on vehicles using technology like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.",
      "The consequences of such actions could prove dire, say safety advocates who credit the federal investigations and recalls with saving lives.",
      "\u201cMusk wants to run the Department of Transportation,\u201d said Missy Cummings, a former senior safety adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of investigations that are underway with Tesla. They will all be gone.\u201d",
      "Within days of Trump taking office, the White House and Musk began waging an unbridled war against the federal government \u2014 freezing spending and programs while sacking a host of career employees, including prosecutors and government watchdogs typically shielded from such brazen dismissals without cause.",
      "The actions have sparked outcries from legal scholars who say the Trump administration\u2019s actions are without modern-day precedent and are already upending the balance of power in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk\u2019s other companies. However, snuffing out federal investigations or jettisoning safety initiatives would be an easier task than their assault on regulators and the bureaucracy.",
      "Investigations into companies like Tesla can be shut down overnight by the new leaders of agencies. And safety programs created through an agency order or initiative \u2014 not by laws passed by Congress or adopted through a formal regulatory process \u2014 can also be quickly dissolved by new leaders. Unlike many of the dismantling efforts that Trump and Musk have launched in recent weeks, stalling or killing such probes and programs would not be subject to legal challenges.",
      "As such, the temporal and fragile nature of the federal probes and safety programs make them easy targets for those seeking to weaken government oversight and upend long-established norms.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\u2019s been stifling Tesla,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a veteran Wall Street technology and automobile industry analyst.",
      "Among Musk\u2019s businesses, the federal government\u2019s power over Tesla to investigate, order recalls, and mandate crash data reporting is perhaps the most wide-ranging. However, the ways the Trump administration could quickly ease up on Tesla also apply in some measure to other companies in Musk\u2019s sprawling business empire.",
      "A host of Musk's other businesses \u2014 such as his aerospace company SpaceX and his social media company X \u2014 are subjects of federal investigations.",
      "Musk\u2019s businesses are also intertwined with the federal government, pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX, for example, has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla, meanwhile, has received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "Musk, Tesla\u2019s billionaire CEO, has found himself in his newly influential position by enthusiastically backing Trump\u2019s third bid for the White House. He was the largest donor to the campaign, plunging more than $270 million of his vast fortune into Trump\u2019s political apparatus, most of it during the final months of the heated presidential race.",
      "Those donations and his efforts during the campaign \u2014 including the transformation of his social media platform X into a firehose of pro-Trump commentary \u2014 have been rewarded by Trump, who has tapped the entrepreneur to oversee efforts to slash government regulations and spending.",
      "As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk operates out of an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most White House staff work and from where he has launched his assault on the federal government. Musk\u2019s power under DOGE is being challenged in the courts.",
      "Even before Trump took office, there were signs that Musk\u2019s vast influence with the new administration was registering with the public \u2014 and paying dividends for Tesla.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock surged more than 60% by December. Since then, its stock price has dropped, but still remains 40% higher than it was before Trump's election.",
      "\u201cFor Musk,\u201d said Ives, the technology analyst, \u201cbetting on Trump is a poker move for the ages.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how it would handle investigations and government oversight involving Tesla or other Musk companies. A spokesman for the transition team said last month that the White House would ensure that DOGE and \u201cthose involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines and conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "In the weeks before Trump took office on Jan. 20, the president-elect\u2019s transition team recommended changes that would benefit the billionaire and his car company, including scrapping the federal order requiring carmakers to report crash data involving self-driving and partially automated technology.",
      "The action would be a boon for Tesla, which has reported a vast majority of the crashes that triggered a series of investigations and recalls.",
      "The transition team also recommended shelving a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, something Musk has publicly called for.",
      "\u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X as he campaigned and raised money for Trump in July.",
      "Auto industry experts say the move would have a nominal impact on Tesla \u2014 by far the largest electric vehicle maker in the U.S. \u2014 but have a potentially devastating impact on its competitors in the EV sector since they are still struggling to secure a foothold in the market.",
      "Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Before the election, he posted a message on X, saying he had never asked Trump \u201cfor any favors, nor has he offered me any.\u201d",
      "Although most of the changes that Musk might seek for Tesla could unfold quickly, there is one long-term goal that could impact the autonomous vehicle industry for decades to come.",
      "Though nearly 30 states have rules that specifically govern self-driving cars, the federal government has yet to craft such regulations.",
      "During a late October call with Tesla investors, as Musk was pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s campaign, he signaled support for having the federal government create these rules.",
      "\u201cThere should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cIf there\u2019s a department of government efficiency, I\u2019ll try to help make that happen.\u201d",
      "Musk leads that very organization.",
      "People whose lives have been forever changed by Tesla crashes fear that dangerous and fatal accidents may increase if the federal government\u2019s investigative and recall powers are restricted.",
      "They say they worry that the company may otherwise never be held accountable for its failures, like the one that took the life of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon.",
      "The college student was on a date with her boyfriend, gazing at the stars on the side of a rural Florida road, when they were struck by an out-of-control Tesla driving on Autopilot \u2014 a system that allows Tesla cars to operate without driver input. The car had blown through a stop sign, a flashing light and five yellow warning signs, according to dashcam video and a police report.",
      "Benavides Leon died at the scene; her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, suffered injuries but survived. A federal investigation determined that Autopilot in Teslas at this time was faulty and needed repairs.",
      "\u201cWe, as a family, have never been the same,\u201d said Benavides Leon\u2019s sister, Neima. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and everything that we design and we build has to be by important codes and regulations. This technology cannot be an exception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has to be investigated when it fails,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause it does fail.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement on Twitter in December 2023, Tesla pointed to an earlier lawsuit the Benavides Leon's family had brought against the driver who struck the college student. He testified that despite using Autopilot, \u201cI was highly aware that it was still my responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.\u201d",
      "Tesla also said the driver \u201cwas pressing the accelerator to maintain 60 mph,\" an action that effectively overrode Autopilot, which would have otherwise restricted the speed to 45 mph on the rural route, something Benavides Leon's attorney disputes.",
      "The federal agency that has the most power over Tesla \u2014 and the entire automobile industry \u2014 is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation.",
      "NHTSA sets automobile safety standards that must be met before vehicles can enter the marketplace. It also has a quasi-law enforcement arm, the Office of Defects Investigation, which has the power to launch probes into crashes and seek recalls for safety defects.",
      "The agency has six pending investigations into Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, prompted by dozens of crashes that took place when the computerized systems were in use.",
      "Other federal agencies are also investigating Musk and Tesla, and all of those probes could be sidelined by Musk-friendly officials:",
      "\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are separately investigating whether Musk and Tesla overstated the autonomous capabilities of their vehicles, creating dangerous situations in which drivers may over rely on the car\u2019s technology.",
      "\u2014The Justice Department is also probing whether Tesla misled customers about how far its electric vehicles can travel before needing a charge.",
      "\u2014The National Labor Relations Board is weighing 12 unfair labor practice allegations leveled by workers at Tesla plants.",
      "\u2014The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is asking a federal judge to force Tesla to enact reforms and pay compensatory and punitive damages and backpay to Black employees who say they were subjected to racist attacks. In a federal lawsuit, the agency has alleged that supervisors and other employees at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, routinely hurled racist insults at Black employees.",
      "Experts said most, if not all, of those investigations could be shut down, especially at the Justice Department where Trump has long shown a willingness to meddle in the department\u2019s affairs. The Trump administration has already ordered the firing of dozens of prosecutors who handled the criminal cases from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.",
      "\u201cDOJ is not going to be prosecuting Elon Musk,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Justice Department's public integrity section who served during the Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. \u201cI\u2019d expect that any investigations that were ongoing will be ground to an abrupt end.\u201d",
      "Trump has also taken steps to gain control of the NLRB and EEOC. Last month, he fired Democratic members of the board and commission, breaking with decades of precedent. One member has sued, and two others are exploring legal options.",
      "Tesla and Musk have denied wrongdoing in all those investigations and are fighting the probes.",
      "The federal agency that appears to have enjoyed the most success in changing Tesla\u2019s behavior is NHTSA, an organization of about 750 staffers that has forced the company to hand over crash data and cooperate in its investigations and requested recalls.",
      "\u201cNHTSA has been a thorn in Musk\u2019s side for over the last decade, and he\u2019s grappled with almost every three-letter agency in the Beltway,\u201d said Ives, the Wall Street analyst who covers the technology sector and automobile industry. \u201cThat\u2019s all created what looks to be a really big soap opera in 2025.\u201d",
      "Musk has repeatedly blamed the federal government for impeding Tesla\u2019s progress and creating negative publicity with recalls of his cars after its self-driving technology malfunctions or crashes.",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 should be recalled,\u201d Musk posted on Twitter (now X) in 2014. Two years ago, he posted, \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\u201d",
      "Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said some investigations might continue under Trump, but a recall is less likely to happen if a defect is found.",
      "As with most car companies, Tesla\u2019s recalls have so far been voluntary. The threat of public hearings about a defect that precedes a NHTSA-ordered recall has generally prompted car companies to act on their own.",
      "That threat could be easily stripped away by the new NHTSA administrator, who will be a Trump appointee.",
      "\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a threat of recall, will Tesla do them?\u201d Brooks said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is where politics seeps in.\u201d",
      "Among the active NHTSA investigations, several are examining fundamental aspects of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems that were in use when dozens of crashes occurred.",
      "An investigation of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system started in October after Tesla reported four crashes to NHTSA in which the vehicles had trouble navigating through sun glare, fog and airborne dust. In one of the accidents, an Arizona woman was killed after stopping on a freeway to help someone involved in another crash.",
      "Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla has twice recalled the \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d feature for software updates. The technology \u2014 the most advanced of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot systems \u2014 is supposed to allow drivers to travel from point to point with little human intervention. But repeated malfunctions led NHTSA to recently launch a new inquiry that includes a crash in July that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle.",
      "NHTSA announced its latest investigation in January into \u201cActually Smart Summon,\u201d a Tesla technology that allows drivers to remotely move a car, after the agency learned of four incidents from a driver and several media reports.",
      "The agency said that in each collision, the vehicles were using the system that Tesla pushed out in a September software update that was \u201cfailing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash.\u201d NHTSA also criticized Tesla for failing to notify the agency of those accidents.",
      "NHTSA is also conducting a probe into whether a 2023 recall of Autopilot, the most basic of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driver assistance systems, was effective.",
      "That recall was supposed to boost the number of controls and alerts to keep drivers engaged; it had been prompted by an earlier NHTSA investigation that identified hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot that resulted in scores of injuries and more than a dozen deaths.",
      "In a letter to Tesla in April, agency investigators noted that crashes involving Autopilot continue and that they could not observe a difference between warnings issued to drivers before or after the new software had been installed.",
      "Critics have said that Teslas don\u2019t have proper sensors to be fully self-driving. Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or in poor visibility conditions. Tesla, on the other hand, relies only on cameras to spot hazards.",
      "Musk has said that human drivers rely on their eyesight, so autonomous cars should be able to also get by with just cameras. He has called technology that relies on radar and light detection to discern objects a \u201cfool\u2019s errand.\u201d",
      "Bryant Walker Smith, a Stanford Law School scholar and a leading automated driving expert, said Musk\u2019s contention that the federal government is holding him back is not accurate. The problem, Smith said, is that Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicles cannot perform as advertised.",
      "\u201cBlaming the federal government for holding them back, it provides a convenient, if dubious, scapegoat for the lack of an actual automated driving system that works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith and other autonomous vehicle experts say Musk has felt pressure to provide Tesla shareholders with excuses for repeated delays in rolling out its futuristic cars. The financial stake is enormous, which Musk acknowledged during a 2022 interview. He said the development of a fully self-driving vehicle was \u201creally the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.\u201d",
      "The collisions from Tesla\u2019s malfunctioning technology on its vehicles have led not only to deaths but also catastrophic injuries that have forever altered people\u2019s lives.",
      "Attorneys representing people injured in Tesla crashes \u2014 or who represent surviving family members of those who died \u2014 say without NHTSA, the only other way to hold the car company accountable is through civil lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWhen government can\u2019t do it, then the civil justice system is left to pick up the slack,\u201d said Brett Schreiber, whose law firm is handling four Tesla cases.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:06:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her government is not ruling out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the &ldquo;Gulf of America.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her government is not ruling out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that her government wouldn't rule out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "The area, long named the Gulf of Mexico across the the world, has gained a geopolitical spotlight in recent weeks after President Donald Trump declared he would change the Gulf's name.",
      "Sheinbaum, in her morning press conference on Thursday, said the president's decree is restricted to the \u201ccontinental shelf of the United States\" because Mexico still controls much of the Gulf. \u201cWe have sovereignty over our continental shelf,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum said that despite the fact that her government sent a letter to Google saying that the company was \u201cwrong\u201d and that \u201cthe entire Gulf of Mexico cannot be called the Gulf of America,\" the company has insisted on maintaining the nomenclature.",
      "It was not immediately clear where such a suit would be filed.",
      "Google reported last month on its X account, formerly Twitter, that it maintains a \u201clong-standing practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.\u201d",
      "An Associated Press analysis shows that as of Thursday, the user's location and other data was dependent on how the Gulf appeared on Google Maps. If the user is in the United States, the body of water appeared as Gulf of America. If the user was physically in Mexico, it would appear as the Gulf of Mexico. In many other countries across the world it appears as \u201cGulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum has repeatedly defended the name Gulf of Mexico, saying its use dates to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "She has also mentioned that, according to the constitution of Apatzing\u00e1n, the antecedent to Mexico\u2019s first constitution, the North American territory was previously identified as \u201cMexican America\u201d. Sheinbaum has used the example to poke fun at Trump and underscore the international implications of changing the Gulf's name.",
      "In that sense, Sheinbaum said on Thursday that the Mexican government would ask Google to make \u201cMexican America\u201d pop up on the map when searched.",
      "This is not the first time Mexicans and Americans have disagreed on the names of key geographic areas, such as the border river between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Tamaulipas. Mexico calls it Rio Bravo and for the United States it is the Rio Grande.",
      "This week, the White House barred AP reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency's policy on the name. AP is using \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d but also acknowledging Trump's renaming of it as well, to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world."

      "Access to the files, which is tightly controlled within the agency, had not been granted as of this weekend, several sources told ABC News.",
      "Still, the request itself has been received with alarm both within the government and among privacy experts who say that granting Musk access to Americans' private taxpayer data could be extraordinarily dangerous.",
      "Musk, estimated to be the richest man in the world, has criticized federal judges for curbing his power and called for their impeachment. Musk also has alleged without evidence or examples of wrongdoing that federal workers were defrauding taxpayers.",
      "\"We do find it rather odd that there are quite a few people in the bureaucracy who have ostensibly a salary of a few hundred thousand dollars, but somehow managed to accrue tens of millions of dollars in net worth while they are in that position,\" Musk told reporters on Feb. 12 while in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump. \"We're just curious as to where it came from.\"",
      "Earlier this month, DOGE employees demanded access to the Treasury Department's vast federal payment system responsible for managing trillions of dollars in government expenditures. That access triggered a lawsuit by 19 states and has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.",

      "According to one person familiar with DOGE's efforts, the team acquiring access the IRS system would not allow them to change any data within it. But if granted, the access would allow unfettered access to access any person's tax filings.",
      "According to an IRS rulebook for the system posted online, anyone accessing IDRS is specifically not allowed to review the personal tax information of relatives, friends, neighbors or celebrities.",
      "\"IDRS users shall not access the account of any taxpayer or another IRS employee unless there is a business need and access has been formally authorized as part of the user's official duties,\" the agency rulebook stated.",

      "Residents in the German town of Geretsried have long wanted to run their buildings with clean heat and electricity from geothermal energy rather than fossil fuels",
      "Residents in the German town of Geretsried have long wanted to run their buildings with clean heat and electricity from geothermal energy instead of fossil fuels.",
      "Their hopes were dashed about 15 years ago when a drilling company couldn't find enough hot water close to the surface to be profitable using traditional geothermal technology. That basically left them with natural gas.",
      "\u201cWe gave up. We had big hopes,\u201d recalled First Mayor of Geretsried Michael M\u00fcller, who was raised in the town.",
      "Today the next generation of geothermal companies is trying to succeed where previous efforts failed. They don't rely on hot water close to the surface, but instead use techniques developed in the oil and gas industry to drill deep and extract heat from dry, hot rock. One of them, Eavor, is starting up its first commercial power plant in Geretsried \u2014 turning the tiny town of about 26,000 people, south of Munich, into a proving ground for the future of geothermal energy.",
      "Can technology like this be scaled and really make a difference for the future of the planet? The International Energy Agency thinks so. In a recent report, it said technology breakthroughs are unlocking huge potential for geothermal energy. Now that companies are drilling deeper than 3 kilometers (close to 2 miles), nearly every country has the potential to make heat and electricity this way, the IEA said.",
      "\u201cIt has been a niche energy and concentrated in a few countries,\u201d IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in an interview. But soon, Birol said, \"geothermal can contribute to the global energy picture in an accelerated manner.\u201d",
      "Eavor CEO John Redfern said the earlier failure in Gerestried opened up the possibility for a high-profile success \u2014 Geretsried\u2019s ordinary geology was appealing. No one would\u2019ve been impressed if the Canadian company demonstrated its technology in Iceland, a place with abundant, easily accessible hot water, he added.",
      "It helped that the town was excited for geothermal and open to new ideas, he added.",
      "\u201cOur whole point is that we want to have geothermal anywhere, everywhere,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cWhat better way to prove that than to put our first well where they tried and failed with traditional geothermal systems.\u201d",
      "Germany is committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels. As part of the commitment, heating systems must switch to renewable sources because heating is one of the main sources of carbon dioxide emissions in Germany. And Germany couldn\u2019t depend on importing natural gas from Russia after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Eavor, named for the phrase \u201cenergy for ever,\u201d has a demonstration facility in Alberta, Canada. Company executives know Geretsried well. One of them managed operations for the contractor that drilled there previously.",
      "This project will start by generating electricity in Geretsried, then add heat as the town fully builds out a district heating system.",
      "With district heating, heat is generated in a central location and distributed to homes and businesses. Most of these systems make their heat from burning fossil fuels, especially in China and Russia, which have the largest number of them, according to the IEA. Europe has 17,000 district heating and cooling networks, serving 67 million people, according to Euroheat & Power, the international network for district energy.",
      "In the United States, district energy systems are most often on college campuses, at hospitals, on military bases and in some downtown areas in larger cities. Some universities are switching their district heating systems off gas or heating oil to geothermal energy to address climate change. The Trump administration, while pivoting back to pro-oil and gas policies, does appear to also favor geothermal.",
      "Eavor has a contract to provide heat in the northwestern German city of Hanover, too. The city of more than 500,000 people is phasing out coal.",
      "Eavor is also licensing its technology to utilities and companies that are trying to curb emissions and want secure energy, Redfern said. A large Japanese power provider, Chubu Electric Power Company, is a major investor in Eavor. Japan has many sites suitable for geothermal but few geothermal power plants.",
      "The way it works is that Eavor drills two wells about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep, then branches out and drills a dozen lateral wells, to maximize contact with the hot rock. The wells intersect to create a closed loop where water can flow, the \u201cEavor loop.\u201d The Geretsried project will have four loops, each with two vertical wells and about 12 lateral ones.",
      "Eavor does not frack, or hydraulically fracture, to create cracks and increase the permeability of rock.",
      "Instead in Geretsried, it will pump water down to flow through the hot rock, heating up on contact. It will rise naturally to the surface through an outlet well.",
      "That hot water can be used to heat the utility's water so it can be sent through pipes to heat the equivalent of about 36,000 homes. The hot water also can be routed to a power plant to make steam and then recirculated. When used to spin a turbine, that steam can generate electricity without any planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "M\u00fcller, the mayor, said it's better to start changing the approach to energy today than push it off to tomorrow. He said residents can't rely on fossil fuels long term, they have to address climate change and they need secure energy.",
      "\u201cWe want to remain future proof,\u201d he said. \u201cSo let's start the future.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 13:27:29 -0500",
    "summary": "GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin said Trump has the capability to apply pressure to Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a deal to end the war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Mullin reaffirms Trump\u2019s controversial rhetoric about a Ukraine peace deal.",
      "Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin said Sunday that President Donald Trump is the only one who has the ability to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate to end the war with Ukraine.",
      "\"Putin knows the one person that can truly change the war is the United States,\" Mullin told co-anchor Jonathan Karl on ABC News' \"This Week.\" \"If we went all-in for Ukraine, if we went all-in with the resources we have, from air superiority to the weapons that we can deploy to Ukraine, Putin knows at that point he would be in an extremely negative position.\"",
      "\"I think that being the opportunity for President Trump to talk to Putin and say, 'Listen, we want to end the war. We don't want to have to engage more, but we're not going to allow you to move forward. So let's negotiate a peace deal here, or you're going to force our hand to be farther involved.'\"",
      "Trump announced via social media on Wednesday that his team would begin negotiations with Putin to end the nearly 3-year-long war. Trump said he and Putin discussed an end to the war in which Ukraine cedes territory captured by Russia and gives up its ambitions to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), two major concessions for Ukraine.",
      "Many world leaders argue Trump has given into Putin's demands before negotiations begin. Trump added that he informed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about his call with Putin after it concluded.",
      "Trump originally made no mention of whether Ukraine would be involved in negotiations, but later said that they would \"of course\" be involved.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Saudi Arabia this week, a source familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "Waltz, Rubio and Witkoff are expected to meet with top Russian officials, multiple sources familiar with the matter told ABC News. The specific timing of the trip is not clear, and it is unclear whether Ukraine will be involved in the talks.",
      "Mullin said he is looking for a scenario in which both parties are present at the negotiating table.",
      "\"I know the negotiations are moving forward, and we want to have Ukraine and Russia both at the table, and I think the negotiations go better if both sides are looking for a peace deal, because they're at a neutral position,\" Mullin said.",
      "Mullin praised Trump's negotiation tactics, despite continuing backlash.",
      "\"What President Trump is doing here is actually really smart. He's meeting with Zelenskyy. He's having conversations with him. You're seeing [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio. You saw, you saw that the senators and representatives both met with Zelenskyy while they were in Munich, and you're seeing them also meeting with Putin in Saudi Arabia,\" Mullin said. \"What that is doing, Jon, is, that's putting both people, getting them in separate rooms, talking about what they will accept, and then finding out a negotiation path forward before you bring them to the table. A lot of times, bring people to the table too fast, Jon, it'll blow up.\"",
      "Mullin also defended Elon Musk's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) began directing mass layoffs after their deferred resignation program ended on Feb. 12. Initially, DOGE has its sights set on probationary employees, individuals with only a couple of years of service, which is nearly 200,000 government workers.",
      "\"Anytime you take over a situation, like Elon Musk has had many opportunities and many experiences with taking over businesses, you have to start cutting some of the fat. And unfortunately, the number one expense we have in the United States government right now is payroll,\" Mullin said.",
      "Karl noted that the largest expenses in the federal budget are for entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.",
      "Musk has promised transparency in his actions, and many Democratic lawmakers have called for him to testify in front of Congress. Whether he does should be left to Trump, Mullin said.",
      "\"That's up to President Trump. Keep in mind, President Trump put in Musk to be a consultant, just like many successful corporations around the world, including myself, that have hired consultants to come in and look at it from an unbiased perspective,\" Mullin said.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 08:38:56 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump's suggestion about &ldquo;getting rid of&rdquo; the nation's disaster relief agency doesn't sound like a bad idea for some residents of western North Carolina who are still navigating the long recovery process from Hurricane Helene",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's suggestion about \u201cgetting rid of\u201d the nation's disaster relief agency doesn't sound like a bad idea for some residents of western North Carolina who are still navigating the long recovery process from Hurricane Helene",
      "SWANNANOA, N.C. -- Emily Russell remembers feeling hopeful after she managed to get an appointment with the Federal Emergency Management Agency not long after Hurricane Helene ripped though her home in Swannanoa, North Carolina.",
      "But after several assistance requests were denied or left pending, Russell says the agency has been of \u201cno help\u201d to her family after the late September storm. Still reeling in a world turned upside-down by the most damaging storm in state history, she finds herself open to President Donald Trump's suggestion about \u201cgetting rid of\u201d FEMA.",
      "That is a common sentiment in the mountains of western North Carolina, where living in a trailer with limited supplies for months can try anyone's patience. Russell, who like many others did not have flood insurance, endured those stresses as she prepared for the birth of her son, but then volunteers stepped up to rebuild her home. Back there now, she can cradle her tiny infant in her arms on her newly constructed front porch \u2014 overlooking a heaping pile of rotting debris and two Trump-Vance signs posted to a pole in her yard.",
      "Frustration with stopgap relief efforts has been exacerbated by confusion over where long-term help should come from. FEMA is meant to be a first line, providing temporary housing and funding for repairs while insurance foots most of the bill. It is not the message residents heard initially, when politicians, including then-President Joe Biden, who toured the damaged area, promised residents they would have whatever they needed.",
      "As more time passes, the reality of long-term recovery has gotten complicated.",
      "To Russell and many others, Trump saying he would consider eliminating FEMA made sense. To some experts and officials, however, that could cause more problems than it would solve.",
      "Days after Trump took office on Jan. 20, he surveyed the fallout from wildfires in California and the hurricane in North Carolina and suggested that states primarily manage the response to natural disasters. As a candidate, he had disparaged FEMA's work in the southern states hit by Helene. That criticism, which began almost as soon as the wind stopped blowing, has not stopped.",
      "More recently, FEMA was criticized by Trump adviser Elon Musk over payments to reimburse New York City for hotel costs for migrants. Four FEMA employees were fired, accused of circumventing leadership to make the transactions, which have been standard for years through a program that helps with costs to care for a surge in migration.",
      "North Carolina's government estimated that Helene caused a record $59.6 billion in damages. FEMA has contributed almost $380 million through public assistance grants to the state and local governments, as well as approximately $372 million directly to North Carolinians as of Feb. 11, according to the agency. FEMA's responsibilities include direct financial assistance to individuals and reimbursements to governments for recovery tasks like debris removal and rebuilding roads.",
      "Russell was confused when she was denied on her FEMA application, especially after she said an inspector told her the home was a complete loss. Rushing floodwaters tore off the side of her house, and heavy mud seeped inside, warping the floorboards and rendering most things unsalvageable. She thought the home she grew up in would be bulldozed.",
      "Russell called FEMA and spoke with representatives in-person about her denied request. She said they told her she needed receipts for certain personal items, which she did not have.",
      "\u201cTo keep being told it\u2019s pending or not approved, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s just a devastating feeling,\u201d Russell said. \u201cI mean, you just feel lost.\u201d",
      "In Buncombe County, where Russell lives, about 70% of homeowners who registered with FEMA received some level of assistance, according to the agency's data. Approximately 91% of those approved received up to $10,000, while about 3.6% got between $25,000 and a maximum payment that would likely top out at a little over $40,000.",
      "Danny Bailey, a 61-year-old Buncombe County retiree, said he received $42,500 after losing practically everything from flooding, including the trailer he lived in, his sister's double-wide mobile home and a barn. His family had moved to the property in 1968.",
      "Bailey already spent some of his money on necessities, such as propane to make it through the winter. He lives in a donated trailer on his property, now a muddy, rutted expanse, and said FEMA \"should\u2019ve done more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf this is the way they are, he ought to do away with them,\u201d Bailey said of Trump, whose win in North Carolina helped propel him to victory in November.",
      "Bailey ran into issues getting the money. A few days after Helene, he said a FEMA inspector came to his property and told him to go online to apply for disaster assistance, but Bailey had no computer or reliable cell service. He traveled almost 100 miles east to Statesville to use his nephew's computer, Bailey said, and then had problems getting clear answers from FEMA on his application status. Eventually, he received his money.",
      "\u201cTheir attitude was, you know, this happened to you, but it's up to you to fix it. And I ain't the one who caused it,\" he said with a laugh.",
      "Complaints about FEMA's application process are common because of the administrative hurdles in place to ensure applicants' eligibility, said Miyuki Hino, a city and regional planning professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. People may also believe FEMA should provide more assistance when its role is mainly to meet immediate needs such as shelter, Hino said.",
      "There always has been an underlying tension on the federal government's role in natural disaster response, but Hino said the agency's increasing politicization could be attributed to the rising frequency of expensive disasters caused by climate change. Dissolving FEMA could create issues when disasters extend beyond state lines or localities need expertise on disasters they are not used to confronting.",
      "Overall, eliminating FEMA would likely slow the recovery process for future disasters, she said.",
      "FEMA's potential eradication worries Dalton George, the mayor pro tempore of Boone, a mountain town in Watauga County that was ravaged by Helene. Despite understandable frustrations, he said the agency moved quickly to help. It has contributed money for home restorations, as well as keeping several families in hotels under its transitory sheltering program, he said.",
      "\u201cIt feels like people are more anti-FEMA than they are about actually solving some of these problems,\u201d George said.",
      "Responsibilities would be partly shifted onto local governments, and George said towns such as Boone do not have resources for that. Private organizations would need to step up more than they have, George said, and they already are overextended.",
      "Vickie Revis relies heavily on private entities such as churches to supply almost everything on her property, including the trailer she stays in with her husband along the Swannanoa River. Her home of eight years was completely swept away by the river \u2014 something she used to associate with beauty and peace but now ties to \u201cterror.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a friend that came in and robbed you of everything you have,\u201d Revis said.",
      "Her restoration process, however, will largely be funded by FEMA, as Revis said she received more than $40,000. She said she had no issues with how the agency handled her situation.",
      "Instead, Revis talked at length about the grief she still lives with: lost pets; meaningful possessions that disappeared; home expansion plans to accommodate more family members that will not happen. She said she rarely left her trailer until recently because she could not bear to face the devastation.",
      "Now, it is the rebuilding that keeps Revis going. How long will that go on?",
      "\u201cHowever long it takes,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of workers have been affected by firings of probationary employees.",
      "Carly Arata received an email around 9 p.m. on Thursday saying her position in the federal government had been terminated.",
      "When she saw the email, Arata told ABC News that she \"screamed.\"",
      "\"I didn't think it was real at first, so I reread it like three times, then kind of started crying because I was relying on this job,\" Arata said. \"My husband and I just purchased this house in December, and now we're not really sure what we're going to do.\"",
      "Arata is one of possibly more than 200,000 workers affected by mass firings of probationary employees.",
      "Arata had been a probationary employee since September with the Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service but had worked as a contractor in the role for a year before that. Arata, who turns 32 on Sunday, has experience in this area. She obtained her bachelor's degree in environmental science and her master's degree in ecological restoration.",
      "\"We're relying on this job and we're qualified for this job, and yet, we're losing it just because we're under a year,\" Arata said.",
      "Arata develops conservation plans for farmers in Georgia and helps them get federal funding.",
      "\"These poor farmers. \u2026 It's like I abandoned them, and that's not the case at all,\" Arata said. \"They were amazing and cared so much about their land, and I wanted to help them preserve that.\"",
      "Arata said the message from Elon Musk and President Donald Trump about waste in the government is misguided.",
      "\"Everyone that is there loves what they do, and they bust their butts to do it,\" Arata said of her colleagues. \"They know their jobs inside and out.\"",
      "She added that the firings will damage farmers the most.",
      "\"They say they care so much about their farmers, and they're taking away the people that help them the most,\" Arata said. \"And they already aren't getting the funding from [the Inflation Reduction Act] currently because the IRA funds are frozen. \u2026 A lot of people are going to miss out on money that is vital to their operations.\"",
      "Arata said she was the only soil conservationist in her office overseeing two counties in Georgia. Her role also included helping farmers with installing wells and watering facilities for animals, cover cropping and cross-fencing for cattle.",
      "When asked about her message to Elon Musk and Trump, Arata said: \"You're offering uncertainty and fear, and I don't see how they think that this is going to make anything better.\"",
      "Among the roughly 2,000 workers fired from the Department of Energy is Corey Krzan Matta, who works on the legal team for the Hanford site nuclear cleanup in Washington state.",
      "Krzan Matta said the firings are \"haphazard.\" He acknowledged that while previous administrations have also tried to cut waste and reduce the government workforce, he argued Trump and Musk are going about it in an \"arbitrary\" way.",
      "\"There's no consideration for the mission. There's no consideration for whether or not this position is critical,\" he said.",
      "Krzan Matta joined the Department of Energy after six years of active-duty service in the Navy and after years of legal experience.",
      "\"I'm not one who likes to sit around twiddling my thumbs,\" Krzan Matta said. \"If there's one thing that's not deficient, it's my performance, and then to have a letter from the Department of Energy that says your performance isn't in the public interest -- it just, there's no rhyme or reason to it.\"",
      "Krzan Matta received the termination email Thursday night. Immediately, his computer access was terminated, and his badge was deactivated.",
      "\"You know custom courtesy within the profession is give you two weeks' notice, give you time to figure out your future,\" he said. \"It is simply: It's done. It's over with. Leave.\"",
      "He argued that rather than cutting waste and increasing inefficiency, Trump's and Musk's efforts are simply overloading already-overworked federal government employees.",
      "\"I think of my colleagues who are already overworked from an incredibly busy schedule with an understaffed team who now have to shoulder all of my work -- because it doesn't just go away because I go away,\" he said.",
      "Hanford is an old Manhattan Project site from when the United States was in the race to build a nuclear bomb during World War II. Fast-forward to 2024, \"the mission is clean up that mess we made while we were producing plutonium enrichment,\" Krzan Matta said.",
      "\"I was overjoyed to have found a job that I really fell in love with, not just for the work that I do [find] interesting and fulfilling, but the mission out here of cleaning up the Hanford site and supporting the community that I grew up in,\" he said.",
      "To Arata, the future looks bleak.",
      "\"I'm going to be driving food delivery or something until I can find something, and thank goodness I have my master's degree and a load of student debt,\" Arata said sarcastically.",
      "\"The nonprofit world isn't looking great either, with what's happening with grants, and that's where I came from,\" she added. \"So I'm not sure I'm going to be able to go back to that, and now I don't have an income at all.\"",
      "Arata said colleagues who accepted the buyout offer are even more confused and have received no guidance. She said those who accepted the offer but were in their probationary periods were also terminated.",

    "summary": "A judge says she will continue to block DOGE from accessing sensitive Treasury Department payment systems while she decides whether to issue a preliminary injunction.",
    "story": [
      "Nineteen states have sued to keep Musk's team from accessing Treasury's systems.",
      "A federal judge in Manhattan on Friday said she will continue to block individuals associated with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive Treasury Department records and payment systems while she considers whether to issue a preliminary injunction.",
      "During a hearing Friday in a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of 19 states, U.S. District Judge Jeanette Vargas did not rule on whether to issue an injunction further blocking DOGE's access, but opted to extend her temporary restraining order from last week.",
      "She suggested her decision would come down over the next few days, but not on Friday night.",
      "The 19 states brought the lawsuit against Musk and the administration, arguing that allowing Musk's associates to access the Treasury Department's payment system as part of Trump's campaign pledge to slash the federal government would be a \"huge cybersecurity risk\" and potentially allow the Trump administration to unlawfully \"block federal funds from reaching beneficiaries who do not align with the President's political agenda.\"",
      "\"All of the States' residents whose [personal identifiable information] and sensitive financial information is stored in the payment files that reside within the payment systems are at risk of having that information compromised and used against them,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "The lawsuit comes as Musk's cost-cutting troops have gained access to at least 16 federal agencies, with Trump recently signing an executive order giving DOGE additional authority to help carry out massive layoffs across the government as part of his campaign pledge to trim the federal bureaucracy.",
      "The lawsuit -- filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and 18 other state attorneys general -- raised particular concern about unvetted DOGE employees accessing sensitive government records including social security numbers, bank information, and federal tax returns. According to the lawsuit, Musk being able to access the Bureau of Fiscal Services -- which serves as the country's checkbook by dispersing trillions in funding -- could allow Musk to cut off government spending from the source.",
      "In a court order last weekend, a federal judge in New York temporarily blocked the Trump administration from allowing individuals associated with DOGE to access the Treasury department records and payment systems.",
      "\"The Court's firm assessment is that, for the reasons stated by the States, they will face irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief. That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking,\" U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer wrote, prompting a Mush to blast the judge and Vice President JD Vance to question the legality of the order.",
      "While the Trump administration challenged the temporary order, U.S. District Judge Jeanette Vargas -- a Biden-nominated judge who will hear the case going forward -- reiterated that there was \"sound factual basis\" for the temporary restraining order when it was imposed late last week.",
      "Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin have signed onto the lawsuit.",

      "The federal judge hearing arguments over whether tech billionaire Elon Musk's role at the Department of Government Efficiency is unconstitutional indicated that she will not issue a ruling Friday on a temporary restraining order blocking Musk's efforts.",
      "Fourteen states filed a federal lawsuit Thursday alleging that Musk's \"expansive authority\" is in violation of the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which calls for anyone deemed a \"principal officer\" of the U.S. government to be formally nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.",
      "The states are seeking a temporary restraining order to block Musk and DOGE from continuing their work, but U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, at a hearing Friday, said that she wants a narrower request from the plaintiffs.",
      "Judge Chutkan, who oversaw Donald Trump's election interference case, said she wants the modified request by 5 p.m. Saturday, after which she will issue a ruling on the temporary restraining order.",
      "The states, in their lawsuit, argue that \"the President does not have the constitutional authority to unilaterally dismantle the government. Nor could he delegate such expansive authority to an unelected, unconfirmed individual.\"",
      "In a motion filed Friday, they asked Judge Chutkan to immediately block Musk from altering the funding for any agency, from placing any employees on leave, from canceling any government contracts, from accessing any sensitive data, and from \"asserting control over\" any agency.",
      "Chutkan oversaw the 2023 criminal case that charged Trump with undertaking a \"criminal scheme\" to overturn the results of the 2020 election in an effort to remain in power. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges, and the case was dismissed following Trump's reelection in November due to a longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "DOGE, led by Musk as the centerpiece of Trump's campaign promise to trim the federal government, has found itself in the crosshairs of multiple federal lawsuits, which allege that it has improperly accessed sensitive records and is unlawfully gutting government agencies. Federal judges have temporarily blocked DOGE from accessing sensitive data at the Treasury Department, while the Department of Education recently reached an agreement to limit DOGE's access to student loan records.",
      "In their motion Friday, the 14 states allege that Musk has already \"cut billions of dollars from agency budgets, fired agency personnel, and that he has moved to, in his words, 'delete' entire agencies. He has canceled government contracts, announced plans to sell government property, and promised to withdraw a multitude of regulations across different agencies. He has installed his own teams into agencies and given them access to the agencies' most sensitive data.\"",
      "\"In other words, an individual accountable only to the President -- if he answers to anyone at all -- is exercising apparently limitless power within the Executive Branch. Mr. Musk's conduct has wreaked havoc on the federal government and caused mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees, the American public, and people around the world who depend on the United States for leadership and support,\" the filing says.",

      "\u201cPeople wanted that very badly,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In a fact sheet provided to reporters, the White House said the order was necessary because COVID vaccine mandates were \"threatening educational opportunities for students.\"",

      "Thank you so much for your time, Mr. Huitema. So, the office you worked in is an independent agency that was working to prevent conflicts of interest in government. Have those guardrails now simply been removed?",
      "HUITEMA: Well, I know that there are committed public servants still at the Office of Government Ethics and ethics officials throughout the executive branch who are committed to their work and committed to upholding those values of integrity.",
      "But certainly those guardrails have been weakened. There is a real change in vision; I would say, from having organizations -- like the inspectors general, the Office of Special Counsel, the Office of Government Ethics -- that have an air of independence and authority and stature to speak without an agenda, you know, play it straight and narrow and uphold integrity, uphold the rule of law and and uphold accountability in government.",
      "ABC NEWS: So should the American public be confident executive branch nominees are not violating ethics rules and are complying with the law?",
      "HUITEMA: Well, we'll have to see. You know, it's interesting -- I was caught by surprise, obviously, by my termination. And my biggest feeling is one of disappointment. I had signed up for a five-year commitment and I was committed to seeing that through.",
      "And I knew that that meant working across multiple administrations and I was willing to serve in good faith any administration, including this one. And we'd actually gotten off to a good start.",
      "The vetting of nominees for cabinet positions, for example, has happened in basically the same way it's happened in the past. And we were able to do those, finish them up at a faster rate than ever before.",
      "But we're entering a new phase now, right? As officials actually come into their positions and are taking actions as government employees, now is when we're entering that time period where real substantive concerns about ethics and integrity can arise.",
      "And my sense is that the president just doesn't want an Office of Government Ethics that's empowered to take those issues seriously and speak to them.",
      "ABC NEWS: Are you concerned about Elon Musk's possible conflict of interest as he takes an unprecedented role in government oversight?",
      "HUITEMA: Well, I don't want to speak to any particular individuals. And, you know, part of the issue with Elon Musk and the DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency] effort, right, is we don't really know exactly what he's doing. So, I'm not privy to any details and don't have anything to share in that regard.",
      "But it's a perfect example of what a challenge it can be for people from the private sector with extensive investments and financial interests to come into government and adjust to the change in expectations, the change in rules that apply.",
      "ABC NEWS: I guess it sounds like an obvious question, but humor us here for a moment, why do you believe that government watchdogs are important?",
      "HUITEMA: Well, I think they're important for a couple of reasons. Even though they are mostly internally focused, they don't have a lot of visibility, I recognize that a lot of people watching probably have never even heard of the Office of Government Ethics, but they help set the tone and build a culture within government of respect for the rule of law, adherence to the rule of law, a commitment to public service, and an expectation of accountability for that public service.",
      "And so as those institutions are eroded, people may not see it right away, but in time, you can expect to see more corruption, more abuse of office and less accountability for that. The guardrails to sort of notice and address those kinds of concerns will be reduced.",
      "And eventually, I guess my big concern is that in the long run, if that continues now, a change of culture is really hard to reverse.",
      "ABC NEWS: David Huitema, we thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.",

      "The battle between New York federal prosecutors and President Donald Trump's Justice Department continued Friday as another prosecutor resigned over the order to dismiss Mayor Eric Adams' bribery case.",
      "Hagan Scotten, the assistant United States attorney for Southern District of New York, blasted Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove in a letter one day after acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Danielle Sassoon resigned over her refusal to follow through with the Justice Department's request.",
      "\"In short, the first justification for the motion -- that [former U.S. Attorney] Damian Williams's role in the case somehow tainted a valid indictment supported by ample evidence, and pursued under different U.S. attorneys is so weak as to be transparently pretextual,\" Scotten wrote.",
      "\"The second justification is worse. No system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives,\" he added.",
      "Scotten, an Army veteran who served in Iraq and clerked under Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh before he was appointed to the Supreme Court, chastised the president and the administration.",
      "\"I can even understand how a Chief Executive whose background is in business and politics might see the contemplated dismissal-with-leverage as a good, if distasteful, deal,\" he wrote.",
      "\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me,\" he added.",
      "The letter came hours after what several former and current federal justice officials dubbed the \"Thursday afternoon massacre,\" when six people involved with the case resigned and pushed back against the U.S. attorney general's office.",
      "Sassoon resigned Thursday over the Justice Department's request to end the federal bribery case against the mayor.",
      "The Justice Department planned to remove the prosecutors handling the mayor's case and reassign it to the Public Integrity Section in Washington, D.C.",
      "However, as soon the Public Integrity Section was informed it would be taking over, John Keller, the acting head of the unit, and his boss, Kevin Driscoll, the most senior career official in the criminal division, resigned along with three other members of the unit, according to multiple sources.",
      "Chad Mizelle, the chief of staff for Attorney General Pam Bondi, pushed back against the defiant prosecutors in a statement Friday afternoon contending Adams' prosecution was politically motivated.",
      "'The fact that those who indicted and prosecuted the case refused to follow a direct command is further proof of the disordered and ulterior motives of the prosecutors. Such individuals have no place at DOJ,\" he said.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has the power to remove Adams from office, called the Department of Justice's moves \"unbelievably unprecedented\" during an interview on MSNBC Thursday night.",
      "\"This is not supposed to happen in our system of justice,\" she told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.",
      "Hochul, however, declined to discuss the possibility of removing the mayor.",
      "\"The allegations are extremely concerning and serious. But I cannot, as the governor of this state, have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction, like a lot of other people are saying right now,\" she said. \"I have to do it smart, what's right, and I'm consulting with other leaders in government at this time.\"",
      "The Rev. Al Sharpton, a longtime ally of Adams, said in a statement Tuesday that he was convening with other Black clergy to discuss the situation but he already raised concerns about the mayor's allegiances.",
      "\"President Trump is holding the mayor hostage,\" Sharpton said.",
      "Four prominent New York City Black clergy members -- the Revs. Johnnie Green, Kevin McCall, Carl L. Washington and Adolphus Lacey -- wrote a letter Wednesday calling on the mayor not to run for reelection this year.",
      "\"Eric Adams had every right to prove his innocence and many of us were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but that\u2019s not what has happened,\" they wrote.",
      "Adams, a former NYPD officer and Democrat who previously registered as a Republican, was accused by federal prosecutors of taking lavish flights and hotel stays from Turkish businessmen and officials for more than a decade.",
      "He and his staff members also allegedly received straw campaign donations to become eligible for New York City's matching funds program for his campaigns, according to the criminal indictment that was issued in September.",
      "In exchange, Adams allegedly used his power as Brooklyn borough president and later as mayor to give the foreign conspirators preferential treatment for various projects and proposals, including permits for the Turkish consulate despite fire safety concerns, the indictment said.",
      "Adams pleaded not guilty, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and claimed without any basis that he was being politically targeted by the Biden administration, even though the probe covers many years before Biden was in office.",
      "Adams' primary opponents have called for him to step down since the indictment, as have other New York Democrats, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.",
      "The mayor, however, appeared on \"Fox and Friends\" on Friday with Trump \"border czar\" Thomas Homan and reiterated he was not only staying in office but he would run for reelection as a Democrat. The deadline to change parties is Friday.",
      "\"People had me gone months ago, but, you know what, I\u2019m sitting on your couch,\" Adams told the hosts.",
      "The mayor remained silent during the interview when Homan discussed Trump's deportation policy and called on Hochul to resign for not cooperating with the federal office.",
      "Adams, however, did light up and smile when the \"border czar\" discussed their partnership. The mayor announced Thursday the city would allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into Rikers Island jail, a major shift in the city's policies.",
      "\"If he doesn\u2019t come through, I\u2019ll be back in New York City, and we won\u2019t be sitting on the couch,\" Homan said with a laugh. \"I\u2019ll be in his office, up his butt, saying, 'Where the hell is the agreement we came to?'\"",
      "Sassoon prosecutor warned in a letter that the close relationship between the Trump administration and Adams crossed a line.",
      "In her letter to Bondi, Sassoon repeatedly suggested Justice Department leadership, including Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, was explicitly aware of a quid pro quo that was suggested by Adams' attorneys.",
      "Sassoon alleged Adams' vocal support of Trump's immigration policies would be boosted by dismissing the indictment against him.",
      "Sassoon's letter detailed a January meeting with Bove and counsel for the mayor, where she says Adams' attorneys put forward \"what amounted to a quid pro quo,\" after which Bove \"admonished a member of my team who took notes during that meeting and directed the collection of those notes at the meeting's conclusion.\"",
      "\"Although Mr. Bove disclaimed any intention to exchange leniency in this case for Adams's assistance in enforcing federal law, that is the nature of the bargain laid bare in Mr. Bove's memo,\" Sassoon wrote in her letter.",
      "Bove accused Sassoon of insubordination and rejected her claims. Trump told reporters Thursday he was not involved with the Justice Department decisions this week and claimed the SDNY prosecutor was fired, although he did not name her.",
      "Adams also denied the allegations Friday.",
      "\"It took her three weeks to report in front of her a criminal action. Come on, this is silly,\" he told the \"Fox and Friends\" hosts.",
      "He released a statement later in the day reiterating his claim",
      "Adams said, \"I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered -- nor did anyone offer on my behalf -- any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never.\"",
      "The dismissal, which is without prejudice, meaning it can be brought again, specifically after the November election, according to Bove's request, has yet to be formally filed in court or reviewed by a judge.",

Others mill about in the shopping centers on the coast and in the capital, some wearing shirts with Lionel Messi\u2019s name on them, carrying bags full of clothes, video games and mobile phones.",
      "They are part of a wave of Argentines who have found Chile to be a budget-friendly paradise this southern summer.",
      "\u201cEverything here is so cheap for us,\u201d said Cristian V\u00e1zquez, who was enjoying the sea in Re\u00f1aca, on Chile\u2019s central coast.",
      "In December 2024, the start of the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s summer, more Argentines went on vacation abroad than in the previous year, with Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay as the top destinations.",
      "Despite a year of economic crisis, Argentines are flocking to beaches, mountains and shopping centers abroad, encouraged by a favorable economic outlook \u2014 and a strong peso.",
      "Between December 2023 and the same month in 2024 the Argentine peso appreciated by around 41% against the official U.S. dollar, thanks in part of a strong adjustment plan implemented by President Javier Milei, an ultra-liberal who came to power at the end of 2023 on vows to \u201cblow up\u201d the central bank, take an axe to the bloated government and kill sky-high inflation.",
      "The stampede of Argentines traveling abroad for their summer vacations is driven by several factors, including the recent devaluation of various foreign currencies, the convenience of nearby destinations accessible by car and the prohibitively high cost of domestic vacations, especially along the Argentine Atlantic coast.",
      "Argentine tourism abroad surged in December, with departures up 76.4% year-over-year to 1.3 million travelers compared to the same month the previous year, according to official figures. Of those, 80.7% visited neighboring countries, primarily Chile (28%), Brazil (22.6%) and Uruguay (15.6%).",
      "Chile has become a popular destination for Argentines, who made up 40% of the 5.2 million visitors to the country in 2024 and early 2025. Chile\u2019s strong economic position relative to Argentina has resulted in competitive prices, a major draw for Argentine tourists.",
      "Chile\u2019s tourism undersecretary, Ver\u00f3nica Pardo, noted that visitors are also spending more than in previous years, averaging about $63.3 per person per day.",
      "Argentine visitors aren\u2019t confined to the sun-drenched beaches of the Chilean coast. Messi jerseys and mate gourds are also a common sight in other neighboring countries.",
      "Nicol\u00e1s Lentini, 37, recently arrived in Brazil, drawn by the devalued real and lower prices. \u201cA week\u2019s rent for four people in Argentina costs $700,\" he said, noting that he paid the same amount for 14 days in B\u00fazios, a Brazilian resort east of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "\u201cBesides, the beaches here are incomparable to ours, where it\u2019s cold. Here, you can wear a T-shirt all day.\u201d",
      "Brazil experienced a surge in tourism after the real depreciated by around 27% in 2024, when it reached a record of 6.6 million foreign arrivals, with Argentines being the main visitors (1.9 million).",
      "Andr\u00e9s Dey\u00e1, from Argentina's federation of travel and tourism business associations, highlighted the challenges of competing with neighboring countries like Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe can provide good services, financing tools, tourism quality and everything else,\u201d he said, but ultimately \"macroeconomic issues define where Argentines decide to travel.\u201d",
      "After a four-year hiatus marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent economic crisis, Luis S\u00e1nchez returned to the exclusive resort of Punta del Este, Uruguay.",
      "\u201cWe like it a lot... this year the prices aren\u2019t as high as they\u2019ve been,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, one of 309,570 Argentines who visited Uruguay between December 20, 2024, and January 13, 2025, representing nearly half of all visitors to the country, where the U.S. dollar appreciated almost 13% against the Uruguayan peso in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "Tourism operators in Argentina note that the Argentine exodus was also fueled by recovering purchasing power due to falling inflation and the recent elimination of a tax on foreign credit card purchases.",
      "Sunbathing in a bikini on a Punta del Este beach, Esperanza Fagalde said she hadn\u2019t vacationed at the Uruguayan resort for the past two years. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t affordable,\u201d she said, citing the unfavorable exchange rate and high costs.",
      "\u201cBut now it is, so we\u2019re back,\u201d she said.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on U.S. interests",
      "MUNICH, Germany -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on U.S. interests.",
      "The proposal, which was at the center of Zelenskyy\u2019s talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday, did not offer any specific security guarantees in return, according to one current and one former senior official familiar with the talks.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s decision to reject a deal, at least for now, was described as \u201cshort-sighted\u201d by a senior White House official.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t let the ministers sign a relevant agreement because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest,\u201d Zelenskyy told The Associated Press on Saturday in Munich.",
      "The proposal focused on how the U.S. could use Kyiv\u2019s rare earth minerals \u201cas compensation\u201d for support already given to Ukraine by the Biden administration and as payment for future aid, current and former senior Ukrainian officials said speaking anonymously so they could speak freely.",
      "Ukraine has vast reserves of critical minerals which are used in aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. The Trump administration has indicated it is interested in accessing them to reduce dependence on China but Zelenskyy said any exploitation would need to be tied to security guarantees for Ukraine that would deter future Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cFor me is very important the connection between some kind of security guarantees and some kind of investment,\u201d the Ukrainian president said.",
      "Zelenskyy did not go into details about why he instructed his officials not to sign the document which was given to Ukrainian officials on Wednesday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bassent on a visit to Kyiv.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a colonial agreement and Zelenskyy cannot sign it,\u201d the former senior official said.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes did not explicitly confirm the offer, but said in a statement that \u201cPresident Zelenskyy is being short-sighted about the excellent opportunity the Trump Administration has presented to Ukraine.\u201d The Trump administration has grown weary of sending additional U.S. aid to Ukraine and Hughes said a minerals deal would allow American taxpayers to \u201crecoup\u201d money sent to Kyiv while growing Ukraine\u2019s economy.",
      "Hughes added that the White House believes \u201cbinding economic ties with the United States will be the best guarantee against future aggression and an integral part of lasting peace.\u201d He added, \u201cThe U.S. recognizes this, the Russians recognize this, and the Ukrainians must recognize this.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials in discussions with their Ukrainian counterparts in Munich were commercially minded and largely concentrated on the specifics of exploring the minerals and how to form a possible partnership to do that with Ukraine, the senior official said.",
      "The potential value of the deposits in Ukraine has not yet been discussed, with much unexplored or close to the front line.",
      "The U.S. proposal apparently did not take into account how the deposits would be secured in the event of continuing Russian aggression. The official suggested the U.S. did not have \u201cready answers,\u201d to that question and that one of their takeaways from discussions in Munich will be how to secure any mineral extraction operation in Ukraine involving people and infrastructure.",
      "Any deal must be in accordance with Ukrainian law and acceptable to the Ukrainian people, the senior Ukrainian official said.",
      "\u201cSubsoil belongs to Ukrainians under the Constitution,\u201d Kseniiia Orynchak, founder of the National Association of Mining Industry of Ukraine previously told the AP suggesting a deal would need popular support.",
      "Zelenskyy and Vance did not discuss the details of the U.S. document during their meeting Friday at the Munich Security Conference, the senior official said. That meeting was \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201csubstantive,\u201d with Vance making it clear his and Trump\u2019s main goal was to achieve a durable, lasting peace, the senior official said.",
      "Zelenskyy told Vance that real peace requires Ukraine to be in a \u201cstrong position\u201d when starting negotiations, stressed that the U.S negotiators should come to Ukraine, and that the U.S., Ukraine and Europe must be at the negotiating table for talks with Russia.",
      "But Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, all but cut Europeans out of any Ukraine-Russia talks, despite Zelenskyy\u2019s request.",
      "\u201cYou can have the Ukrainians, the Russians, and clearly the Americans at the table talking,\u201d Kellogg said at an event hosted by a Ukrainian tycoon at the Munich Security Conference. Pressed on whether that meant Europeans won\u2019t be included, he said: \u201cI\u2019m a school of realism. I think that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
      "Ukraine is now preparing a \u201ccounter proposal\u201d which will be delivered to the U.S. in \u201cthe near future,\u201d the official said.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important that the vice president understood me that if we want to sign something, we have to understand that it will work,\u201d Zelenskyy told AP.",
      "That means, he said, \u201cIt will bring money and security.\u201d",

    "summary": "As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted the sea",
    "story": [
      "As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted the sea",
      "LOS ANGELES -- On a recent Sunday, Tracy Quinn drove down the Pacific Coast Highway to assess damage wrought upon the coastline by the Palisades Fire.",
      "The water line was darkened by ash. Burnt remnants of washing machines and dryers and metal appliances were strewn about the shoreline. Sludge carpeted the water's edge. Waves during high tide lapped onto charred homes, pulling debris and potentially toxic ash into the ocean as they receded.",
      "\u201cIt was just heartbreaking,\u201d said Quinn, president and CEO of the environmental group Heal the Bay, whose team has reported ash and debris some 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Palisades burn area west of Los Angeles.",
      "As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted the sea. The Palisades and Eaton fires scorched thousands of homes, businesses, cars and electronics, turning everyday items into hazardous ash made of pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead, heavy metals and more.",
      "Since much of it could end up in the Pacific Ocean, there are concerns and many unknowns about how the fires could affect life under the sea.",
      "\u201cWe haven't seen a concentration of homes and buildings burned so close to the water,\" Quinn said.",
      "Fire debris and potentially toxic ash could make the water unsafe for surfers and swimmers, especially after rainfall that can transport chemicals, trash and other hazards into the sea. Longer term, scientists worry if and how charred urban contaminants will affect the food supply.",
      "The atmospheric river and mudslides that pummeled the Los Angeles region last week exacerbated some of those fears.",
      "When the fires broke out in January, one of Mara Dias' first concerns was ocean water contamination. Strong winds were carrying smoke and ash far beyond the blazes before settling at sea, said the water quality manager for the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental nonprofit.",
      "Scientists on board a research vessel during the fires detected ash and waste on the water as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) offshore, said marine ecologist Julie Dinasquet with the University of California, San Diego\u2019s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Things like twigs and shard. They described the smell as electronics burning, she recalled, \u201cnot like a nice campfire.\u201d",
      "Runoff from rains also are a huge and immediate concern. Rainfall picks up contaminants and trash while flushing toward the sea through a network of drains and rivers. That runoff could contain \u201ca lot of nutrients, nitrogen and phosphate that end up in the ash of the burn material that can get into the water,\u201d said Dias, as well as \"heavy metals, something called PAHs, which are given off when you burn different types of fuel.\u201d",
      "Mudslides and debris flows in the Palisades Fire burn zone also can dump more hazardous waste into the ocean. After fires, the soil in burn scars is less able to absorb rainfall and can develop a layer that repels water from the remains of seared organic material. When there is less organic material to hold the soil in place, the risks of mudslides and debris flows increase.",
      "Los Angeles County officials, with help from other agencies, have set thousands of feet of concrete barriers, sandbags, silt socks and more to prevent debris from reaching beaches. The LA County Board of Supervisors also recently passed a motion seeking state and federal help to expand beach clean ups, prepare for storm runoff and test ocean water for potential toxins and chemicals, among other things.",
      "Beyond the usual samples, state water officials and others are testing for total and dissolved metals such as arsenic, lead and aluminum and volatile organic compounds.",
      "They also are sampling for microplastics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, that are harmful to human and aquatic life, and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a group of man-made chemicals shown to cause cancer in animals and other serious health effects. Now banned from being manufactured, they were used in products like pigments, paints and electrical equipment.",
      "County public health officials said chemical tests of water samples last month did not raise health concerns, so they downgraded one beach closure to an ocean water advisory. Beachgoers were still advised to stay out of the water.",
      "Dinasquet and colleagues are working to understand how far potentially toxic ash and debris dispersed across the ocean, how deep and how fast they sunk and, over time, where it ends up.",
      "Forest fires can deposit important nutrients like iron and nitrogen into the ocean ecosystem, boosting the growth of phytoplankton, which can create a positive, cascading effect across the ecosystem. But the potentially toxic ash from urban coastal fires could have dire consequences, Dinasquet said.",
      "\u201cReports are already showing that there was a lot of lead and asbestos in the ash,\u201d she added. \"This is really bad for people so its probably also very bad for the marine organisms.\"",
      "A huge concern is whether toxic contaminants from the fire will enter the food chain. Researchers plan to take tissue fragments from fish for signs of heavy metals and contaminants. But they say it will take a while to understand how a massive urban fire will affect the larger ecosystem and our food supply.",
      "Dias noted the ocean has long taken in pollution from land, but with fires and other disasters, \u201ceverything is compounded and the situation is even more dire.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:46:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Pam Bondi had insisted at her Senate confirmation hearing that as attorney general, her Justice Department would not &ldquo;play politics.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "Pam Bondi had insisted at her Senate confirmation hearing that as attorney general, her Justice Department would not \u201cplay politics.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Pam Bondi had insisted at her Senate confirmation hearing that as attorney general, her Justice Department would not \u201cplay politics.\u201d",
      "Yet in the month since the Trump administration took over the building, a succession of actions has raised concerns the department is doing exactly that.",
      "Top officials have demanded the names of thousands of FBI agents who investigated the Capitol riot, sued a state attorney general who had won a massive fraud verdict against Donald Trump before the 2024 election, and ordered the dismissal of a criminal case against New York Mayor Eric Adams by saying the charges had handicapped the Democrat's ability to partner in the Republican administration's fight against illegal immigration.",
      "Even for a department that has endured its share of scandals, the moves have generated great upheaval and tested its independence. Recent firings and resignations have rattled the foundations of an institution that has prided itself on being driven solely by facts, evidence and the law, and led to this question: Will a president who raged against his own Justice Department during his first term succeed in bending it to his will entirely in his second?",
      "\u201cWe have seen now a punishing ruthlessness that acting department leadership and the attorney general are bringing to essentially subjugate the workforce to the wishes and demands of the administration, even when it\u2019s obvious\u201d that some of the decisions have all the signs \"of corrupting the criminal justice system,\u201d said retired federal prosecutor David Laufman, a senior department official across Democratic and Republican administrations.",
      "He spoke not long after Manhattan\u2019s top federal prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, resigned in protest following a directive from Emil Bove, the Justice Department's acting No. 2 official, to dismiss the case against Adams.",
      "In a letter foreshadowing her decision, Sassoon accused the department of acceding to a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 dropping the case to ensure Adams\u2019 help with Trump\u2019s immigration agenda. Though a Democrat, Adams had for months positioned himself as eager to aid the administration's effort in America's largest city, even meeting privately with Trump at Trump's Florida estate just days before the Republican took office.",
      "Multiple high-ranking officials who oversaw the Justice Department's public integrity section, which prosecutes corruption cases, joined Sassoon in resigning.",
      "On Friday, a prosecutor involved in the Adams case, Hagan Scotten, became at least the seventh person to quit in the standoff, telling Bove in a letter that it would take a \u201cfool\u201d or a \u201ccoward\u201d to meet his demand to drop the charges. (Bove and department lawyers in Washington ultimately filed paperwork Friday night to end the case).",
      "Though the circumstances are significantly different, the wave of resignations conjured memories of the 1973 \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d when multiple Justice Department leaders quit rather than carry out President Richard Nixon's orders to fire the Watergate special prosecutor.",
      "\u201cEven though there may not be more resignations, a clear message has been sent about the objectives and the expectations of the department,\u201d said Alberto Gonzales, who served as attorney general under Republican President George W. Bush until his 2007 resignation in the wake of the dismissal of several U.S. attorneys.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of the department is to ensure that our laws are carried out, that those who engage in criminal wrongdoing are prosecuted and punished,\u201d Gonzales said. And to some it may appear \u201cthat if you have some kind of relationship with the White House, there may not be consequences for doing something that ordinary Americans engaged in similar conduct would be punished.\u201d",
      "Bove, a former New York federal prosecutor himself who represented Trump in his criminal cases, pointedly made no assessment about the legal merits of the case against Adams. Bove cited political reasons, including the timing of the charges months before Adams' presumed reelection campaign and the restrictions the case had placed on the mayor's ability to fight illegal immigration and violent crime.",
      "In a letter to Sassoon, Bove said case prosecutors would be subject to internal investigations.",
      "Bondi defended the decision to drop the case, asserted in a Fox New interview Friday that Adams was targeted after he criticized the Biden administration's immigration policies. Her chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, said prosecutors who refused the dismissal order have \u201cno place at DOJ.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe decision to dismiss the indictment of Eric Adams is yet another indication that this DOJ will return to its core function of prosecuting dangerous criminals, not pursuing politically motivated witch hunts,\" Mizelle said in a statement that accused prosecutors without evidence of \"disordered and ulterior motives.\"",
      "At the White House on Friday, Trump said he was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the Adams case and knew \u201cnothing\u201d about it.",
      "The New York showdown follows a separate dispute between Bove and the acting FBI leadership over his demands for a list of agents involved in the investigations of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol so the Justice Department could determine whether personnel action was warranted.",
      "The request was seen by some as a precursor to possible mass firings, but it was also consistent with Trump's fury over those criminal cases, which he erased with sweeping pardons soon after his inauguration.",
      "Bove referred to the acting FBI director's resistance to his directive as an act of \u201cinsubordination\u201d and said agents who \u201csimply followed\u201d orders would not lose their jobs but those who acted with \u201cpartisan intent\u201d were at risk.",
      "In between White House terms, Trump and his allies pressed the case that the Justice Department had become \u201cweaponized\u201d against conservatives and him in particular, citing separate indictments that were later dismissed after Trump won back the presidency in November.",
      "On her first day on the job, Bondi announced the creation of a \u201cWeaponization Working Group,\u201d to scrutinize the prosecutors who brought criminal and civil cases against Trump and to examine the Jan. 6 prosecutions. She wrote in a memo that the department \u201cmust take immediate and overdue steps to restore integrity and credibility\u201d and to ensure that personnel were \u201cready and willing\u201d to implement the president's agenda.",
      "The group, notably, was not tasked with examining other politically sensitive matters more favorable to Trump, including a special counsel's investigation of Democratic President Joe Biden's handling of classified information or the prosecution of Biden's son Hunter, who was convicted of gun and tax charges before receiving a pardon from his father in December.",
      "Among the prosecutors singled out by the working group was special counsel Jack Smith, who brought two criminal cases against Trump, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose civil fraud suit against Trump led to a nearly $500 million judgment.",
      "A frequent target of Trump\u2019s ire, James would surface again days later when Bondi, in her first news conference, announced a lawsuit against the state of New York over a law that allows people who might not be in the U.S. legally to get a driver\u2019s license. Bondi opened her remarks by saying she had \u201cfiled charges\u201d against James and Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, before later clarifying that she was referring to a lawsuit.",
      "More departures \u2014 and more turmoil \u2014 could be ahead.",
      "\u201cThe prospect of the hollowing out of the Justice Department and the (FBI) is now a live and dangerous risk being played out,\u201d said Laufman, the retired prosecutor. \u201cWhere it goes from here, we just can't currently assess.\u201d"

    "summary": "George Washington was uneasy about the idea of commemorating his life",
    "story": [
      "George Washington was uneasy about the idea of commemorating his life",
      "NORFOLK, Va. -- Like the other Founding Fathers, George Washington was uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life. He was the first leader of a new republic, not a king.",
      "And yet the United States will once again commemorate its first president on Monday, 293 years after he was born.",
      "The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to the bonanza of consumerism it has become today. For some historians, the holiday has lost all discernible meaning.",
      "Historian Alexis Coe, author of \u201cYou Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington,\u201d has said she thinks about Presidents Day in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. bearing his name.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to anything that looks or sounds like him?\u201d she remarked in an interview with The Associated Press in 2024. \u201cJefferson and Lincoln are presented as people with limbs and noses and words associated with their memorials. And he\u2019s just a giant, granite point. He has been sanded down to have absolutely no identifiable features.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at how things have evolved:",
      "Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the Potomac River in Virginia.",
      "Technically, though, he was born Feb. 11 under the ancient Julian calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was adopted in 1752, adding 11 days.",
      "Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday, according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work.",
      "\u201cIf he had it his way, he would be at home with his family,\u201d Coe said. \u201cMaybe some beloved nieces and nephews (and friend) Marquis de Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha\u2019s recipe for an indulgent cake. But that\u2019s about it.\u201d",
      "Washington\u2019s birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when he was president, mostly.",
      "Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in office, Coe said. By then, Washington was less popular, partisanship was rampant and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including Thomas Jefferson.",
      "\u201cOne way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to keep working through his birthday,\u201d Coe said.",
      "The Library of Congress does note a French military officer, the comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington\u2019s 50th birthday in 1782.",
      "Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its distinction from the British crown. He didn\u2019t want to be honored like a king, Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, told the AP last year.",
      "Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure going off into heaven.",
      "\u201cEven in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism with patriotic memory,\u201d said Bruggeman, whose books include \u201cHere, George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public History of a National Monument.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress established a committee to arrange national \u201cparades, orations and festivals,\u201d according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday for federal employees in the District of Columbia.",
      "The official designation for the holiday is Washington\u2019s Birthday, although it has come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments have been made to honor President Lincoln as well because his birth date falls nearby, on Feb. 12.",
      "A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln\u2019s birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day.",
      "But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington\u2019s Birthday.",
      "By the late 1960s, Washington\u2019s Birthday was one of nine federal holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week, according to a 2004 article in the National Archives\u2019 Prologue magazine.",
      "Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day weekends.",
      "The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian C. L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue.",
      "Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers \u201cwould have been deeply worried\u201d by how the holiday became taken over by commercial and private interests.",
      "\u201cThey were very nervous about corporations,\u201d Bruggeman said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic.\u201d",
      "Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America, said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no moment of reflection,\u201d Coe said. Given today\u2019s widespread cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection \u201cwould probably be a good idea.\u201d"

      "Wisconsin\u2019s second-oldest prison that was built in the 1800s would finally be shuttered under a new plan from Gov. Tony Evers",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin\u2019s second-oldest prison, built in the 1800s and long targeted for closure, would finally be shuttered under a new plan from Gov. Tony Evers that proposes sweeping changes to the state\u2019s troubled correctional system without building a new facility, as some lawmakers have long called for.",
      "Evers presented his plan as the best and only option to address the state\u2019s aging facilities, which have been beset with deaths of incarcerated people, assaults against staff including one that left a juvenile guard dead, lockdowns, lawsuits, federal investigations, criminal charges against prison staff, resignations and rising maintenance costs.",
      "The roughly $500 million proposal, made public on Sunday, would be subject to approval by the Republican-controlled Legislature, which has backed some aspects in the past but also has repeatedly blocked initiatives by the Democratic governor.",
      "Evers cast the proposal as a better option than building a new adult prison that he said would take at least a decade to complete and cost more than $1.3 billion.",
      "\u201cThis plan is as good as plans get,\u201d Evers said at a Friday briefing while encouraging Democrats and Republicans to work together to enact it. \u201cWe have to get this done, period.\u201d",
      "The state\u2019s current trajectory of maintaining aging, overcrowded and understaffed prisons is not sustainable, Evers said.",
      "The multi-tiered plan starts with finally closing the troubled Lincoln Hills and Cooper Lake juvenile correctional facilities in northern Wisconsin and building a new one near Madison at the site of a current minimum security prison. The Lincoln Hills campus would then be converted into a medium security adult prison. The prison in Green Bay, built in 1898, would be closed.",
      "The plan also proposes that the state\u2019s oldest prison in Waupun, built in 1851, be converted from a maximum security prison to a medium security center focused on vocational training. The Stanley Correctional Center would be converted from a medium to a maximum security prison and the prison in Hobart would be expanded to add 200 minimum security beds.",
      "Another key part of the plan is expanding options for those convicted of nonviolent offenses to participate in the earned release program and be set free earlier.",
      "All of the changes would take place over the next six years.",
      "Republicans and Democrats alike have been calling for years to close both the prisons in Waupun and Green Bay. But concerns over job losses in the communities and the cost of building a new prison have been stumbling blocks.",
      "There would be no staff layoffs under the new plan, the Evers administration said.",
      "Evers said he hoped lawmakers would come together and support the plan, much like they did in 2017 when they agreed to close the Lincoln Hills juvenile prison. Eight years later, that prison remains open amid obstacles to fully implementing the closure plan."

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to ending Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine has left European allies and Ukrainian officials worried they are being largely sidelined by the new U.S. administration as Washington and Moscow plan direct negotiations.",
      "With the three-year war grinding on, Trump is sending Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and special envoy Steve Witkoff to Saudi Arabia for talks with Russian counterparts, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to publicly discuss the upcoming diplomatic efforts and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It is unclear to what extent Ukrainian or European officials will be represented in discussions expected to take place in Riyadh in the coming days. The official said the United States sees negotiations as early-stage and fluid, and who ultimately ends up at the table could change.",
      "In an exchange with reporters Sunday, Trump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwill be involved\u201d in the negotiations. Trump offered no further explanation.",
      "The outreach comes after comments by top Trump advisers this past week, including Vice President JD Vance, raised new concerns in Kyiv and other European capitals that the Republican administration is intent on quick resolution to the conflict with minimum input from Europe.",
      "\u201cDecades of the old relationship between Europe and America are ending,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an address Saturday at the Munich Security Conference. \u201cFrom now on, things will be different, and Europe needs to adjust to that.\u201d",
      "White House officials on Sunday pushed back against the notion that Europe has been left out of the conversation. Trump spoke by phone in recent days with French President Emmanuel Macron and is expected to consult with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer this week.",
      "During his visit to Munich and Paris, Vance held talks with Macron, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte as well as Zelenskyy.",

      "\"They absolutely are and at the end of the day, though, this is going to be under President Trump\u2019s leadership that we get this war to an end,\u2019\u2019 Waltz said.",
      "Rubio, who was in Israel on Sunday before heading to Saudi Arabia, said the U.S. is taking a careful approach as it reengages with Moscow after the Biden administration's clampdown on contacts with the Kremlin following the February 2022 invasion.",
      "Trump spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week and the two leaders agreed to begin high-level talks on ending the war. They were initially presented as two-way, but Trump later affirmed that Ukraine would have a seat \u2014 though he did not say at what stage.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether any Ukrainians would take part in the upcoming Riyadh talks. A Ukrainian delegation was in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to pave the way for a possible visit by Zelenskyy, according to Ukraine's economy minister.",
      "Trump on Sunday said they he believed Putin is eager for a deal, while also noting that Russia has historically impressed on the battlefield.",
      "\u201cI think he wants to stop fighting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey have a big powerful machine, you understand that. they defeated Hitler and they defeated Napoleon. They\u2019ve been fighting a long time.\u201d",
      "Heather Conley, a deputy assistant secretary of state for Central Europe during Republican President George W. Bush's administration, said that with Trump's current approach to Moscow, the U.S. appears to be \u201cseeking to create a new international approach based on a modern-day concert of great powers.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it is only for the great powers to decide the fate of nations and to take \u2014 either by purchase or force \u2014 that which strengthens the great powers\u2019 economic and security interests,\u201d Conley said. \u201cEach of these powers posit claims or coerce countries in their respective regional spheres of influence.\u201d",
      "There is some debate inside the administration about its developing approach to Moscow, with some more in favor of a rapid rapprochement and others wary that Putin is looking to fray the Euro-Atlantic alliance as he aims to reclaim Russian status and wield greater influence on the continent, according to the U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Trump said last week that he would like to see Russia rejoin what is now the Group of Seven major economies. Russia was suspended from the G8 after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to have them back. I think it was a mistake to throw them out. Look, it\u2019s not a question of liking Russia or not liking Russia,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI think Putin would love to be back.\u201d",
      "The anticipated Saudi talks also come amid tension over Trump's push to get the Ukrainians to agree to give the U.S access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals in exchange for some $66 billion in military aid that Washington has provided Kyiv since the start of the war, as well as future defense assistance.",
      "Zelenskyy, who met on Friday with Vance and other senior U.S. officials in Munich, said he had directed Ukraine's minister to not sign off, at least for now. He said in an interview that the deal as presented by the U.S. was too focused on American interests and did not include security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "The White House called Zelenskyy's decision \u201cshort-sighted,\" and argued that a rare-earth's deal would tie Ukraine closer to the United States \u2014 something that Moscow doesn't want to see.",

      "\u201cThe concept of Presidents Day is a confusing mishmash of ideas,\u201d Hunter Abell, a Republican state legislator from Washington state, said recently. \u201cBy celebrating all the presidents, I believe that we inadvertently celebrate none.\u201d",

      "Jailed and disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein alleges in a new lawsuit that his brother, Bob Weinstein, and other executives at their now-defunct film company duped him into guaranteeing a $45 million loan in 2016, but diverted funds for their own personal use while setting the stage for his downfall.",
      "Harvey Weinstein, 72, filed the claims Thursday in a long-running civil case in New York City involving a lender accusing him of defaulting on the loan. He is currently detained while awaiting a retrial on sex crimes charges in New York.",
      "\u201cHarvey Weinstein was deceived by those closest to him, and secured a $45 million dollar loan under the pretense of saving The Weinstein Company,\u201d Imran Ansari, Harvey Weinstein's lawyer, said in a statement. \u201cWhile Harvey personally guaranteed the loan, others within The Weinstein Company enriched themselves and strategically undermined him, leaving him \u2018holding the bag\u2019 of debt while \u2018lining their pockets\u2019 when the company was in crisis.\u201d",
      "Ansari alleged Bob Weinstein and others at The Weinstein Co. were in on a plot to position Harvey Weinstein for a downfall in an attempt to seize control of the company, which went bankrupt in 2018 as the sexual misconduct scandal surrounding Harvey Weinstein exploded.",
      "An attorney for Bob Weinstein, Brian Kohn, replied with a brief statement Friday saying, \u201cHarvey\u2019s allegations are entirely without merit,\u201d in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Former Weinstein Co. chief operating officer David Glasser, now chief executive of 101 Studios, known for its production of Paramount's popular series \u201cYellowstone,\u201d is also named in Harvey Weinstein's lawsuit. He did not immediately return a phone message left at his office Friday.",
      "AI International Holdings loaned the money to two affiliates of The Weinstein Co. and Harvey Weinstein, and later sued when it said they defaulted.",
      "Harvey Weinstein alleges that his brother, Glasser and others duped him into guaranteeing the $45 million loan by saying the money would help the financially struggling company. Instead, his lawsuit says, they diverted millions of dollars from the company for improper purposes, leaving it short on cash and Harvey Weinstein liable for repaying the loan.",
      "\u201cAs a direct result of these actions, the Companies were drained of, at the very least, $12 million in cash that should have been allocated to repay the Loan owed to AI International,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThis mismanagement left the Companies unable to satisfy their financial obligations, resulting in insolvency and placing Weinstein at substantial personal financial risk as the guarantor of the Loan.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the state Supreme Court in Manhattan, says Weinstein was made to suffer \u201csevere and outrageous financial and reputational harm.\u201d",
      "It also makes several allegations of financial misconduct against Bob Weinstein, Glasser and others.",
      "It accuses Bob Weinstein of withdrawing at least $6 million from company accounts under false pretenses, to give himself priority over creditors including AI International.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Glasser approved and received $5 million in excessive bonuses and unauthorized financial transactions, and used company funds to pay his father $1 million despite no legitimate business reason.",
      "AI International Holdings sued Harvey Weinstein and the two affiliates of The Weinstein Co. in late 2017. The lawsuit said they defaulted on the loan after AI International had ordered the entire balance to be paid immediately because Harvey Weinstein had been dismissed as co-chairman amid the sexual misconduct allegations.",
      "According to Harvey Weinstein, Bob Weinstein and Glasser settled their liability for the loan with AI International for about $15 million due to \u201cbad faith negotiations,\u201d leaving Harvey Weinstein responsible for the remaining $30 million plus interest.",
      "Harvey Weinstein's lawsuit seeks to shield him from any financial liability for the loan, as well as punitive damages for alleged fraud and financial misconduct and his legal fees.",
      "Bob Weinstein recently asked the judge to reject subpoenas for documents and a deposition issued by Harvey Weinstein's lawyer.",
      "Harvey Weinstein, who also co-founded the film company Miramax, was once one of the most powerful people in Hollywood, having produced films such as \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cThe Crying Game.\u201d",

      "He has long maintained that any sexual activity was consensual.",
      "Harvey Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. Another charge filed in September alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "His 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence were overturned last year, as an appeals court found the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case."

      "NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. -- At Niagara Falls, the iconic honeymoon and tourist destination on the U.S.-Canadian border, visitors from both countries took in President Donald Trump\u2019s unsolicited suggestion that the U.S. annex its neighbor to the north with an air of detached amusement.",
      "Do they take the idea seriously? Generally speaking, no. But some citizens of both nations wonder why it\u2019s necessary to pick a fight with one of America\u2019s closest allies when there wasn\u2019t much friction there to begin with.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re allies,\u201d said Shannon Robinson, of Milton, Ontario. \u201cWe love you guys. And we\u2019re proud of the amicable relationship we have. But we\u2019re also proud to be distinct.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s idea is bold, offensive and ignorant, but \u201che can say what he wants, and it's actually bringing Canadians together right now,\" said Robinson, standing on the Niagara Falls Observation Tower, which extends over the Niagara Gorge and affords an unobstructed view of all three falls and the Niagara River.",
      "In some instances, that togetherness involved booing. The response was slightly more muted on a recent day as bundled-up tourists from all over the world braved sub-freezing temperatures to catch a glimpse of the majestic falls.",
      "Jeremy Powers, of Panama City, Florida, said the Republican U.S. president's talk of annexing one of America's closest allies and trading partners is \u201cvery weird.\u201d",
      "\u201cHaving that as their own independent nation needs to be maintained, I feel,\u201d said Powers, who was in New York state on a work trip and decided to check out Niagara Falls.",
      "\u201cYou know, we don\u2019t need to try and manifest destiny and gather more land. We need to partner and work with other countries in a more friendly manner,\u201d Powers said before dropping down on one knee to open up a bag containing his camera equipment.",
      "Manifest destiny, the idea that the United States is exceptional among world nations and destined by God to expand its territory across North America, drove U.S. growth through the 19th century. Territorial expansion was not a prominent feature of foreign policy debates before Trump started talking about taking on Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal \u2014 and even colonizing Mars.",
      "\u201cThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons,\u201d Trump said in his inaugural address. \u201cAnd we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\u201d",
      "Canadian energy minister Jonathan Wilkinson agreed that Trump is uniting Canadians, but he said they're done laughing about his talk of annexation.",
      "\u201cOn the 51st state, I think, you know, when that was said the first time, some people thought it was funny,\u201d Wilkinson said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI don\u2019t think Canadians find it funny anymore.\u201d",
      "Back at Niagara Falls, plumes of vapor rose off the frigid water. On Rainbow Bridge, an American flag and a Canadian flag stand feet apart, the representation of two neighboring countries overseeing the shared beauty of nature.",
      "Joseph Sullivan, a landscaper who made the trek from New Orleans to upstate New York, sees Trump\u2019s proposal as \u201charsh.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll he\u2019s doing,\" Sullivan said, \u201cis creating chaos and making other countries want to hate America.\u201d",

      "The Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General says it's launching an audit of the security controls for the federal government\u2019s payment system",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General on Friday said it was launching an audit of the security controls for the federal government's payment system, after Democratic senators raised red flags about the access provided to Trump aide Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team.",
      "The audit will also review the past two years of the system's transactions as it relates to Musk's assertion of \u201calleged fraudulent payments,\u201d according to a letter from Loren J. Sciurba, Treasury\u2019s deputy inspector general, that was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The audit marks part of the broader effort led by Democratic lawmakers and federal employee unions to provide transparency and accountability about DOGE's activities under President Donald Trump's Republican administration. The Musk team has pushed for access to the government's computer systems and sought to remove tens of thousands of federal workers.",
      "\u201cWe expect to begin our fieldwork immediately,\u201d Sciburba wrote. \u201cGiven the breadth of this effort, the audit will likely not be completed until August; however, we recognize the danger that improper access or inadequate controls can pose to the integrity of sensitive payment systems. As such, if critical issues come to light before that time, we will issue interim updates and reports.\u201d",
      "Tech billionaire Musk, who continues to control Tesla, X and SpaceX among other companies, claims to be finding waste, fraud and abuse while providing savings to taxpayers, many of his claims so far unsubstantiated. But there is a risk that his team's aggressive efforts could lead to the failure of government computer systems and enable Musk and his partners to profit off private information maintained by the government.",
      "Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon led the push for the inspector general office's inquiry.",
      "On Wednesday, Warren, Wyden and Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noting the inconsistencies in the accounts provided by his department about DOGE.",
      "\u201cYour lack of candor about these events is deeply troubling given the threats to the economy and the public from DOGE\u2019s meddling, and you need to provide a clear, complete, and public accounting of who accessed the systems, what they were doing, and why they were doing it,\u201d the Democratic lawmakers wrote in their letter.",
      "The Treasury Department provided conflicting information about DOGE's access to the payment system. Initially, it claimed the access was read only, only to then acknowledge that a DOGE team member briefly had the ability to edit code, and then to say in an employee sworn statement that the ability to edit was granted by accident.",
      "The 25-year-old employee granted the access, Marko Elez, resigned this month after racist posts were discovered on one of his social media accounts, only for Musk to call for his rehiring with the backing of Trump and Vice President JD Vance.",
      "Advocacy groups and labor unions have filed lawsuits over DOGE\u2019s potential unauthorized access to sensitive Treasury payment systems, and five former treasury secretaries have sounded the alarm on the risks associated with Musk\u2019s DOGE accessing sensitive Treasury Department payment systems and potentially stopping congressionally authorized payments.",
      "Earlier this week, the Treasury declined to brief a pair of the highest-ranking lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee, including Wyden, on the ongoing controversy related to DOGE's use of Treasury payment systems, citing ongoing litigation.",

    "story": [
      "Last month, an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter collided as the plane prepared to land at Washington D",
      "On Jan. 29, an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter collided as the plane prepared to land at Washington D.C.\u2019s Ronald Reagan National Airport. Both plunged into the Potomac River, killing all 67 people aboard.",
      "Since then, much of the attention has focused on the helicopter's altitude, and whether it may have been flying too high. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is handling the investigation, plans to brief reporters Friday on their probe.",
      "The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.",
      "Air travel remains overwhelmingly safe in the U.S., but there have been a string of incidents in recent weeks, including a fiery explosion on Jan. 31 when a medical transport jet crashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood, killing seven people. Last week, a small commuter aircraft crashed off western Alaska, killing 10 people.",
      "American Airlines Flight 5342 was coming in from Wichita, Kansas, carrying 60 passengers and four crew members, as it approached Reagan National to land on a clear Wednesday night. Nearby, a U.S. Army Black Hawk with three soldiers on board was on a training exercise, practicing emergency evacuation routes that would be used to ferry out key government officials in case of an attack or catastrophe.",
      "A few minutes before the twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed, and flight-tracking sites show the plane adjusted its approach.",
      "Shortly before the collision, a controller got an alert that the plane and Black Hawk were converging and asked the helicopter if it had the plane in sight. The military pilot said yes and asked for \u201cvisual separation\u201d with the jet \u2014 allowing it to fly closer than otherwise may have been allowed if the pilots didn\u2019t see the plane. Controllers approved the request.",
      "Roughly 20 seconds later, the aircraft collided.",
      "Since the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board has recovered all the flight data recorders and pulled the wreckage of both aircraft from the Potomac.",
      "It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report on the crash, but officials have been providing regular updates as investigators learn more and they plan to publish a preliminary report in the coming weeks.",
      "Almost immediately after the crash, President Donald Trump publicly faulted the helicopter, which had a flight ceiling of 200 feet (61 meters), for flying too high. He also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. When pressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims. A few days later, Trump placed the blame on what he called an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system.",
      "Army officials have said the Black Hawk crew was highly experienced and familiar with the crowded skies around Washington.",
      "Altitude data was not fully clear in the early days of the investigation, with conflicting numbers from the plane's flight data recorder and the control tower.",
      "At the time, however, investigators were still working to recover information from the helicopter\u2019s black box, which had been waterlogged after plunging into the river, and to refine other data.",
      "Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet\u2019s flight recorder showed a change in its angle, though they did not say whether that indicated the pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.",
      "The Army identified the Black Hawk crew as Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach of Durham, North Carolina; Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. O\u2019Hara was the crew chief and Eaves and Lobach were pilots.",
      "Among the jet\u2019s passengers were several members of the Skating Club of Boston returning from a development camp for elite junior skaters that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita.",
      "The victims also included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas, four members of a steamfitters\u2019 local union in suburban Maryland, nine students and parents from Fairfax County, Virginia, schools and two Chinese nationals."

      "Conservatives who have spent decades promoting deep cuts to government are giving mixed reviews to the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-led project to slash the federal workforce and reduce or end disfavored programs",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Conservatives who have spent decades promoting deep cuts to government are giving mixed reviews to the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-led project to slash the federal workforce and reduce or end disfavored programs.",
      "The Associated Press interviewed four veteran budget hawks, including some who have worked on Republican presidential campaigns predating Musk or President Donald Trump becoming dominant in GOP politics.",
      "Some say Musk\u2019s early targets demonstrate success and show more potential than previous efforts to downsize government due to his unique access and influence. Others say it\u2019s too early to tell and argue that DOGE has stoked conservative outrage about specific agencies without going after much bigger pieces of the federal budget, like defense spending or programs with bipartisan support like Medicare and Social Security.",
      "A list of savings provided by the White House last week noted at least $2.2 billion in initial savings identified by the group. The DOGE website has since noted at least $5.6 billion. Any total so far is a tiny fraction of Musk's initial goal of $2 trillion, the size of the federal budget deficit, or even the $1 trillion he has since mentioned more regularly.",
      "Here's what the budget hawks said:",
      "Norquist, whose government-cutting advocacy goes back to the administration of President Ronald Reagan, is famous for having said in 2001, \u201cI don\u2019t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u201d",
      "He cheered Musk's early efforts.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at what they found after looking for a few days \u2014 I\u2019m not going to second-guess some of the larger numbers they are talking about \u2014 this thing has paid for itself many times over now,\" Norquist said. As of last week, DOGE was operating with about $14 million, according to the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\u201cNever mind if they find anything more,\u201d Norquist added.",
      "Musk is succeeding, no matter the final tally of DOGE's work, because he has unfettered access both to Trump and millions of followers on the social media platform he owns, X, Norquist said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t bat it down and tell it to go away because X is out there before defenders of allowing Washington to do whatever it wants,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cThat group can\u2019t get over the fact that 10 million people read a tweet by Elon Musk listing five things suggesting Washington is out of control.\u201d",
      "Musk's early efforts appear to be aimed more at satisfying Trump's culturally conservative base than targeting the biggest government spending sources, said Riedl, a veteran Republican budget analyst who was chief economist for former Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, the conservative Heritage Foundation's senior budget researcher, and the architect of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s 10-year deficit reduction proposal.",
      "By seeking to eradicate racial and gender-based diversity, equity and inclusion spending from the the federal civil service, Musk is succeeding in getting the attention of Trump-styled conservatives with relatively few dollars to show for it, she said.",
      "Cancelling so-called DEI contracts across the federal government is akin to cancelling the media subscriptions to national outlets such as The Associated Press, The New York Times, Politico and The Washington Post, she said. They are all regular targets of criticism from Trump's core supporters.",
      "\u201cSo far, DOGE seems more about looking for symbolic culture war savings than truly reducing the budget deficit in any meaningful way,\u201d said Riedl,",
      "Likewise, Musk's effort to encourage many of the hundreds of thousands of eligible federal employees to accept terms to quit immediately in exchange for months of pay is seen by that same segment of voters as ridding the government of a force seen as thwarting Trump's policy agenda.",
      "\u201cThese really get attention of Trump conservatives as fronts in the culture war, but ultimately do not save very much money at all,\" Riedl said.",
      "A large majority of federal spending is tied up in Medicare and Social Security, veterans benefits, defense spending and interest on the national debt. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump insisted he would protect the two politically sacrosanct entitlement programs and expand the U.S. military, making these areas unlikely targets for cuts.",
      "\u201cIf Trump were serious about the deficit, he'd be addressing Social Security, Medicare, defense and veterans benefits,\u201d Riedl said. \u201cAnd that's if the public even cares. I've seen no real evidence that they do.\u201d",
      "Only about a quarter of Americans said they were in favor of, as Musk recommended Thursday, eliminating entire federal agencies, according to an Associated Press-NORC poll conducted in January. Likewise, only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults said they favored eliminating a large number of federal jobs.",
      "So far, DOGE's recommendations read like a public relations campaign aimed at discrediting the federal government, said Nowrasteh, an executive for the libertarian think tank and co-author of a report published in December recommending cuts to Musk's group.",
      "Nowrasteh thinks the group may be shoring up its standing with conservative voters before it reaches for further buy-in among more moderate voters.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to take down portions of the government that appear to be liberal or left leaning. And in the process, they are trying to expose some of the sillier aspects of what is being funded,\" he said.",
      "The Cato Institute called for cutting 10% of the federal workforce \u2014 translating to a loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs \u2014 and requiring at least 10% compensation cuts for those that remain. Besides the defense and entitlement cuts, they also propose selling all federal land, turning national parks over to states for management, among myriad other dramatic changes.",
      "\u201cMost of the public is innumerate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don't know the difference between a million and a billion. It seems like a lot of money to you and me. But to the federal government, it's nothing.\u201d",
      "With Musk\u2019s global profile and access in Trump\u2019s world, DOGE has the potential to be far-reaching in a way previous efforts at deficit and budget reduction have not, said Madni, who leads a newer conservative budget and spending think tank aimed at working closely with Congress.",
      "The access that Trump is granting DOGE means Musk\u2019s team will have a view into a broad range of the government\u2019s spending, she said. And Musk\u2019s huge social media following, paired with Trump\u2019s election victory, gives the project an air of momentum, Madni said.",
      "\u201cWe see DOGE as an incredible opportunity to address some of the challenges that we have known existed in federal spending for a long time and haven\u2019t really had the window to address,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s making budget cuts, budget review, cool again.\u201d",
      "She argued the Republican-controlled Congress would also be more likely to limit its budgets with DOGE's help.",
      "\u201cI think part of this conversation really has to be that DOGE is doing a phenomenal job already highlighting that there are places to make cuts, to reprioritize and save taxpayers money and reduce the deficit,\u201d she said. \u201cBut besides that, there is Congress.\u201d"

      "\u201cOpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk\u2019s latest attempt to disrupt his competition,\" said a statement Friday from Bret Taylor, chair of OpenAI's board.",
      "OpenAI attorney William Savitt in a letter to Musk's attorney Friday said the proposal \u201cis not in the best interests of OAI\u2019s mission and is rejected.\u201d",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker nearly a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit he helped found a decade ago.",
      "Then on Monday, while that case was still awaiting a key ruling, Musk and his own AI startup, xAI, and a group of investment firms announced a bid to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI. Musk in a court filing Wednesday expanded on the proposal to acquire the nonprofit\u2019s controlling stake in the for-profit OpenAI subsidiary.",
      "Savitt's letter Friday said that filing added \u201cnew material conditions to the proposal. As a result of that filing, it is now apparent that your clients\u2019 much-publicized \u2018bid\u2019 is in fact not a bid at all.\u201d In any event, \u201ceven as first presented,\u201d the board has unanimously rejected it, Savitt said.",
      "Musk has alleged in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. Musk had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.",
      "He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including OpenAI's business partner Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would halt OpenAI\u2019s plans to more fully convert itself into a for-profit business. Musk also added xAI as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was also unfairly stifling business competition. A judge is still considering Musk's request but expressed skepticism about some of his claims in a court hearing last week."

      "Officials have offered few details of the cross-country investigation, which broke open after the Jan. 20 shooting death of a Border Patrol trooper in Vermont during a traffic stop.

      "LaSota began promoting an extreme mix of rationalism, ethical veganism, anarchism and other value systems, said Jessica Taylor, an AI researcher who met LaSota both in person and online through the rationalist community and knew her as Ziz.",
      "When LaSota left the rationalists behind, she took with her a group of \u201cextremely vulnerable and isolated\u201d followers, Anna Salamon, executive director of the Center for Applied Rationality, told the San Francisco Chronicle.",
      "Taylor said Ziz adherents use the rationalist ideology as a reason to commit violence. \u201cStuff like, thinking it\u2019s reasonable to avoid paying rent and defend oneself from being evicted,\u201d she said.",
      "Poulomi Saha, a professor who has studied cults, said LaSota\u2019s beliefs and writings may have made readers feel seen, an often central factor in the formation of groups commonly labeled cults. That\u2019s especially true in the era of online communities, in which it\u2019s easier for marginalized people to seek fellow believers.",
      "\u201cFor the person who feels hailed by that blog post, there is likely to be a kind of dual experience,\u201d said Saha, co-director of the program in critical theory at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cOne where they feel like \u2018I have been saying this, or thinking this, all along, and no one has believed me.\u2019\u201d",
      "LaSota, 34, has not responded to multiple Associated Press emails in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. She has missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest. Associated Press reporters have left numerous phone and e-mail messages with LaSota's family and received no response.",
      "In November 2019, LaSota was arrested along with several other people at a protest outside a Northern California retreat center where the Center for Applied Rationality was holding an event. Sheriff\u2019s deputies called in a SWAT team and armored vehicle after the mask-wearing group blocked the property\u2019s exits and handed out fliers railing against the rationalist organization. The group said they were protesting sexual misconduct inside the rationalist group.",
      "The case against LaSota, Emma Borhanian, 31, Gwen Danielson and Alexander Leatham, 29, was pending in August 2022 when the U.S. Coast Guard responded to a report that LaSota had fallen out of a boat in San Francisco Bay. Her body wasn\u2019t found, but her mother confirmed the death and an obituary was published.",
      "It wasn\u2019t long before Ziz surfaced again.",
      "By the autumn of 2022, LaSota had moved with other group members, including Borhanian and Leatham, into vans and box trucks on property owned by Curtis Lind in Vallejo, about 30 miles north of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cEmma\u2019s van was amazing,\u201d said someone who knew Borhanian. \u201cIt had a refrigerator and freezer and microwave. It was truly a work of art.\u201d",
      "The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears for her safety, described Borhanian as a kind and loving young woman so smart that she worked at Google while in college. Google did not respond to an inquiry about Borhanian's employment there.",
      "Prosecutors say she was among those who attacked Lind on Nov. 13 when he tried to evict the group for not paying rent.",
      "Impaled by a sword and partially blinded, Lind fought back, fatally shooting Borhanian. Concluding that Lind acted in self-defense, officials charged Leatham and Suri Dao, 23, with murder in Borhanian\u2019s death, as well as attempted murder of Lind.",
      "A person reached by an Associated Press reporter at a phone number listed for Alex Leatham\u2019s father declined to comment. Attempts to reach family members for Dao were not successful.",
      "Police believe LaSota was at the scene of the crime, but she was not arrested.",
      "On New Year\u2019s Eve of 2022, a couple was shot and killed in their home in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania.",
      "A doorbell camera captured audio and video of a car pulling up to the home of Richard Zajko, 71, and his wife, Rita, 69. A voice shouts \u201cMom!\u201d and another voice exclaims, \u201cOh my God! Oh, God, God!\u201d according to a Pennsylvania state police affidavit. Police found the couple shot in the head in an upstairs bedroom after they failed to show up to take care of Rita\u2019s mother.",
      "Police questioned the couple\u2019s daughter, Michelle, at her home in Vermont, and a few weeks later, took her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel. She wasn't arrested or charged with anything. LaSota was at the hotel, too, and was arrested after refusing to cooperate with officers, and charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.",
      "Six months later, LaSota was released on bail but stopped showing up for court.",
      "LaSota\u2019s attorney, Daniel McGarrigle, said last month his client was \u201cwholly and unequivocally innocent of the charges filed in this case.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the case regarding the landlord in California was headed to trial. The landlord, who was 82, was the only eyewitness, and prosecutors wanted to hurry along the proceedings.",
      "But on Jan. 17, Lind\u2019s throat was cut, and he died, not far from where he had survived the earlier attack.",
      "Maximilian Snyder, 22, who is charged with murder, appeared in court Feb. 6, only long enough to request a new attorney. It's not clear how he was identified as a suspect; he has ties to a woman who just days later would be involved in a shootout.",
      "Snyder is listed as in custody in the Solano County Jail in California. Attempts to reach family members of Snyder were not successful.",
      "On. Jan 20, in Vermont, U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped a vehicle carrying two people connected to the Ziz group. A hotel worker had called authorities after seeing one of them, Teresa Youngblut, with a gun.",
      "Youngblut was driving the car when it was pulled over on Jan. 20, and authorities say she quickly opened fire on officers. The passenger, Felix Bauckholt, a German national who is also listed in court documents as Ophelia, died, along with the border patrol agent, David Maland.",
      "Youngblut was wounded and arrested and has pleaded not guilty to firearms charges.",
      "Authorities who searched the car found a ballistic helmet, night-vision goggles, respirators and ammunition, the FBI said. They also found two-way radios and used shooting range targets.",
      "Youngblut applied for a marriage license with Snyder, the man accused of murdering the elderly landlord. He was a childhood friend; it was unclear if they were married. Authorities say the gun she was carrying was purchased by a person of interest in the Zajko killings.",
      "Youngblut and Bauckholt had been living at the two condos in North Carolina, where the landlord and neighbors now say they saw the odd behavior.",
      "LaSota also had been living there as recently as this winter, said the landlord, who reviewed LaSota\u2019s 2019 police booking photo. He spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned for his safety.",
      "Expressing similar concerns, a neighbor who lived in the other side of Bauckholt\u2019s duplex until September 2023 recalled seeing three people wearing long black robes and tactical clothes.",
      "\u201cThey rarely came out during the day but would walk around the neighborhood and in the woods at night,\u201d the former neighbor said, who also spoke only on condition of anonymity because of concerns for their safety. \u201cSometimes all three of them would go for a walk and they all held hands. They seemed to care for each other a great deal.\u201d",

      "No longer in charge, Sen. Mitch McConnell has been speaking his mind",
      "WASHINGTON -- No longer in charge, Sen. Mitch McConnell has been speaking his mind, the long-serving GOP leader rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s more high-profile Cabinet nominees \u2014 alone at times, among the Republicans, casting his no votes.",
      "When it came to Pete Hegseth, now the defense secretary, who faced allegations of excessive drinking and aggressive behavior toward women, McConnell said the combat veteran had \u201cfailed, as yet, to demonstrate\u201d he was ready for the job.",
      "The \u201cdesire to be a change agent is not enough,\u201d McConnell said.",
      "On Tulsi Gabbard, who was sworn in this week as director of national intelligence, he said she has displayed \u201ca history of alarming lapses in judgment,\u201d citing in particular her views toward Russia, China and the security breach by former government contractor Edward Snowden.",
      "And as Senate Republicans confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, McConnell, a survivor of childhood polio  who used a wheelchair during the vote, opposed.",
      "\u201cA record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr. Kennedy to lead these important efforts,\u201d the Kentucky senator said.",
      "This is McConnell unplugged, three weeks into the Trump administration, and his new role as no longer the Senate GOP leader but one of 100 senators. It is testing the strength, but also the limits, of his influence on the institution, where he has been a monumental presence for nearly 40 years.",
      "McConnell is far from an anti-Trump Republican and hardly the face of the GOP opposition to the White House. He has voted to confirm Trump\u2019s other nominees and said he expects to support Trump's agenda.",
      "But his opposition to the trio of Trump's most controversial nominees stands out. Taken together, McConnell's votes against Hegseth, Gabbard and RFK Jr. provide a window into the type of leader he intends to be outside the stately leadership office. And it shows the shifts in his power, as few other Republicans joined him, leaving him often on his own, with Democrats, unable to stop Trump's choices.",
      "\u201cMcConnell\u2019s votes on the Trump nominees reflect, at least in part, the fact that he is more free to vote in accord with personal preferences than he was when he was responsible for serving as the leader and voice for Senate Republicans,\u201d said Frances Lee, a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton.",
      "Just two other Republicans, the independent-minded Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, also voted against Hegseth.",
      "\u201cNow that he is no longer in leadership, Sen. McConnell enjoys more freedom to simply exercise his own individual judgment and personal discretion,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Trump lashed out after the latest votes, calling McConnell \u201cbitter\u201d and \u201cnot equipped mentally\u201d during a lengthy rant in the Oval Office late Thursday, after Kennedy was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cI feel sorry for Mitch,\u201d the Republican president said.",
      "\u201cHe votes against almost everything now. He\u2019s a, you know, very bitter guy,\u201d Trump said of McConnell, who had been a crucial partner as the Senate majority leader during Trump's first term.",
      "Together, Trump and McConnell passed shared priorities, notably the 2017 GOP tax bill, but the two also clashed \u2014 the president calling the senator \u201cOld Crow,\u201d which McConnell turned into a badge of honor \u2014 and had a very public falling out after the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden. McConnell called Trump \u201cmorally responsible\u201d for the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection by a mob of his supporters at the Capitol but ultimately endorsed Trump's reelection bid.",
      "Trump did not appear Thursday to understand that McConnell had polio as a child, a factor as he weighed Kennedy's nomination.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s lost his power,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things.\u201d",
      "When he announced he was stepping down as GOP leader, McConnell said he would finish his Senate term, which expires after the 2026 election. It\u2019s unclear if he will run again.",
      "To be sure, McConnell is far from marginalized. He commands prime positions as chairman of the influential Rules Committee as well as the chairman of the Appropriation Committee\u2019s subcommittee on defense, where he has signaled he intends to make his mark shoring up the nation\u2019s military assets and assuring U.S. leadership on the global stage.",
      "\u201cI expect to support most of what this administration is trying to accomplish,\u201d McConnell said during a recent interview on CBS' \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d",
      "The senator still faces polio\u2019s lingering effects, particularly in his left leg. McConnell fell twice recently, on the steps from the Senate chamber, where he was swiftly caught and steadied by two GOP colleagues, and a short time later in the private GOP lunchroom. He sometimes uses a wheelchair as he did this week as a precaution.",
      "Other senators are watching and weighing the turn of events.",
      "\u201cHe seems to be liberated, and I think he\u2019s voting his conscience,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat.",
      "Blumenthal said while other Republicans are \u201cin a state of trembling in fear\u201d over primary threats if they don\u2019t fall in line with Trump\u2019s agenda, particularly from billionaire Trump aide Elon Musk\u2019s political group, McConnell is not among them.",

      "McConnell\u2019s critics have also taken notice. Nate Morris, a businessman in Kentucky, said this week he is considering a Senate run in 2026.",

      "LIBERTY, Mo. -- An 86-year-old Kansas City man pleaded guilty Friday to a lesser charge in the 2023 shooting of Ralph Yarl, a Black honor student who rang the white man\u2019s doorbell by mistake.",
      "Andrew Lester was scheduled to stand trial next week on charges of first-degree assault and armed criminal action in the shooting of the then-16-year-old, who survived and is now a freshman at Texas A&M, where he is a member of ROTC and the school's marching band.",
      "As part of a plea deal, Lester pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, a charge that Judge David Chamberlain said carries up to seven years behind bars. Lester, who will be sentenced on March 7, was hunched over as he was wheeled into the courtroom, his hands folded.",
      "Yarl and his mother, Cleo Nagbe, sat in the front row during the hearing.",
      "In a statement issued after Lester's plea, Nagbe thanked her family's supporters who \u201csaw Ralph\u2019s humanity, and rejected a world where fear and prejudice endanger innocent lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile this marks a step toward accountability, true justice requires consequences that reflect the severity of his actions \u2014 anything less would be a failure to recognize the harm he has caused,\u201d she said.",
      "The state will seek a five-year prison sentence for Lester, Clay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson told reporters after the hearing.",
      "\u201cSelf-defense has limits,\u201d Thompson said.",
      "Under the first-degree assault charge, Lester was facing a potential sentence of between 15 and 30 years behind bars, depending on the circumstances. One of the key elements of second-degree assault is that defendants \u201chave the burden of injecting the issue of influence of sudden passion arising from adequate cause.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is probably perceived as some middle ground, and the heat of passion would be what was the motivation for the shooting,\u201d said J.R. Hobbs, a Kansas City defense attorney who is not involved in the case. \u201cIf he was afraid or whatever, it may not rise to a full defense. The parties might agree to that because on one hand, it\u2019s a felony conviction \u2014 no trial, no possible appeal. On the other hand, with a lesser statutory limit, the defendant\u2019s exposure is less as well.\u201d",
      "Yarl showed up on Lester\u2019s doorstep on the night of April 13, 2023, after he mixed up the streets where he was supposed to pick up his twin siblings.",
      "Lester\u2019s attorney, Steve Salmon, has long argued that Lester was acting in self-defense and that he was terrified by the stranger who knocked on his door as he settled into bed. Authorities say Lester shot Yarl twice: first in the head, then in the arm.",
      "The shooting shocked the country and renewed national debate about gun policies and race in the U.S.",
      "Yarl testified at an earlier hearing that he rang the bell and then waited for someone to answer for what seemed \u201clonger than normal.\u201d As the inner door opened, Yarl said, he reached out to grab the storm door.",
      "\u201cI assume these are my brothers\u2019 friends\u2019 parents,\u201d he said.",
      "He said Lester shot him in the head and uttered, \u201cDon\u2019t come here ever again.\u201d Although the bullet didn\u2019t penetrate Yarl\u2019s brain, the impact knocked him to the ground. Yarl said Lester then shot him in the arm. The teen was taken to the hospital and released three days later.",
      "His family said the shooting took a big emotional toll and they have filed a lawsuit against the retired aircraft mechanic.",
      "Salmon said last year that Lester\u2019s physical and mental condition had deteriorated. He said Lester has had heart issues, a broken hip and has been hospitalized. Lester also has lost 50 pounds (23 kilograms), which Salmon blamed on the stress of intense media coverage and death threats he subsequently received.",
      "During Friday's hearing, the judge asked Lester whether he was in poor health. Lester responded yes.",

      "\u201cPresident Trump is touring a new Boeing plane to checkout the new hardware/technology,\" said Steven Cheung, the White House communications director. \u201cThis highlights the project\u2019s failure to deliver a new Air Force One on time as promised.\u201d",
      "Air Force One is a modified Boeing 747. Two exist and the president flies on both of the more than 30-year-old planes. Boeing Inc. has the contract to produce updated versions, but delivery has been delayed while the aircraft maker has lost billions of dollars on the project.",

But while LeVere Bolling juggled committee meetings, the delegate went into labor. Clerk G. Paul Nardo confirmed she is the first lawmaker granted permission to vote remotely because of childbirth.",
      "\u201cBeing a woman, you feel pressured to just always show up,\u201d she said before giving birth. \u201cI feel compelled because of the issues \u2014 I feel compelled because of the lives that we\u2019re all leading and the tumultuous political climate that we\u2019re living in to be here. I almost feel this guilt or shame for being pregnant during this time, and I shouldn\u2019t, right?\u201d",

This year\u2019s House rules allow Democratic House Speaker Don Scott to approve a member to participate electronically to ensure their safety.",

      "A beluga calf born in July is growing and meeting the other members of Shedd Aquarium's pod in Chicago",
      "CHICAGO -- Charlie Jacobsma slapped the surface of a pool enclosure at Chicago\u2019s Shedd Aquarium and scanned the water for movement.",
      "Moments later, the head of a beluga calf emerged, mouth agape in what looked like a smile. Jacobsma's face lit up in response as he cooed to the calf like a human parent to a toddler.",
      "Shedd\u2019s animal care team described its newest resident, born to 35-year-old resident beluga Naya in July 2024, as just that.",
      "\u201cLike a toddler that\u2019s learning to talk and making noises, he\u2019s the same way,\" said Jacobsma, director of animal behavior and training at Shedd. \"He\u2019s just constantly growing and developing.\u201d",
      "The calf received several herrings from Jacobsma, who noted the baby whale has yet to grow in his teeth.",
      "For the aquarium staff, every birth is significant and the first beluga born at Shedd in four years was no different. Shedd staff have witnessed 15 beluga births since 1991.",
      "There was an all-hands-on-deck approach that summer evening, with divers in the water to ensure success. Bella, another female in the enclosure, helped the newborn to the surface before Naya took over.",
      "Baby boy beluga \u2014 his current moniker \u2014 is slowly being introduced to the rest of Shedd's pod of eight whales. Aquarium members are voting on options for the calf's name.",
      "In the wild, belugas live in remote arctic and sub-arctic waters where it is hard to gather research. Much of what humans know about belugas, especially births, comes from aquariums, Jacobsma said.",
      "The largest beluga whales at the aquarium have grown as long as 14 feet (4.26 meters) and weigh over 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms), and it is not uncommon for them to live into their 30s under human care, according to Kayley Galassini, a Shedd spokesperson. Some of the belugas born at Shedd are moved to other accredited aquariums once they have reached maturity, she said.",
      "Shedd\u2019s animals are trained to voluntarily participate in their own healthcare, so staff are able to monitor pregnancies through ultrasounds and other care.",
      "What surprises Jacobsma about this young whale and the rest of the Shedd's pod?",
      "Tongue tickles.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who the first person was to put their hand in a beluga\u2019s mouth to figure it out, but it\u2019s very sensitive in their mouth, probably from the prey that they eat at the bottom of the ocean,\" Jacobsma said. \"It\u2019s almost like petting a dog or a cat, and you\u2019ll see them come up and want to interact with us and open up their mouth wide for those tongue tickles.\u201d",

    "summary": "US President Donald Trump is set to impose 25% taxes on steel entering the country \"without exceptions\".",

      "Imposing US tariffs on UK steel would be \"negative\" for both countries, the business secretary has said.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK and US have a \"mutual interest\" in negotiating an exemption from President Donald Trump's plans for the 25% import tax, which could come into force in March.",
      "He said the UK was in a different trading position to other countries and could offer \"very specialised\" steel and aluminium exports the US needs like Navy submarine casings made in Sheffield, while tariffs would push up costs for US taxpayers.",
      "Reynolds' comments came after the government promised up to \u00a32.5bn in support for the UK steel industry.",
      "President Trump has said his tariffs would be enforced \"without exceptions or exemptions\".",
      "However, Reynolds told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that imposing them on UK steel \"would be negative for ourselves, it would be negative for the US as well\".",
      "He said he has had \"some very constructive conversations with key people in the Trump administration recognising our relationship is different\", including the US special envoy to the UK.",
      "The minister told the programme he thought there was a basis for \"constructive engagement\" between the UK and US but \"I'm not saying it's easy\".",
      "He added: \"I appreciate they have a mandate for changing how they approach the issues of trade, but we have got a different argument, a different story to tell, to the EU or to China in relation to our trading relationships.\"",
      "The government has already said it would not retaliate immediately to the tariffs announced by Trump.",
      "UK Steel, which represents the industry, has said the tariffs would be a \"devastating blow\" that would damage the sector's \u00a3400m-a-year contribution to UK-US trade.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports.",
      "But there are concerns within the industry the tariffs might not just hinder exports to the US, but also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This could occur if other countries no longer exporting to the US decide to offload steel at cheaper prices, which could potentially lead to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the \"uncertainty\" the steel industry faced due to US tariffs was something the government \"has been entirely silent on when instead they should be talking to the US, our closest trading partner\".",

      "The consultation will also examine electricity costs for steel companies \"to make the UK competitive globally\", but the government has not yet made a firm commitment to reduce energy bills.",
      "Griffiths said he looked forward to seeing a detailed plan, but added \"a clear part must be steps to reduce the cost of energy which is placing an intolerable strain on UK steel\".",
      "Help for the sector will be available through the National Wealth Fund, which partners the government with the private sector and local authorities to finance infrastructure and other projects.",
      "The government says this financial assistance could benefit Scotland, as well as areas of England such as Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, Rotherham and Redcar which have \"a strong history of steel production\".",

      "The GMB union said the government's plan to support the \"beleaguered\" steel industry provided \"desperately needed\" funding after \"years of dithering\".",
      "\"As the world becomes more volatile, primary domestic steel making capacity is vital for both our economy and domestic security,\" the union's national secretary Andy Prendergast added.",
      "Gareth Stace, director-general of UK Steel, said the government's commitment to the industry was \"both vital and welcome\".",
      "Information gathered in the consultation will be used to help form a \"steel strategy\", to be launched in the spring.",
      "Stace added a robust strategy \"has the power to reverse the sector's decline, particularly as we face increasing competition from imports benefiting from more favourable business conditions\".",
      "The Liberal Democrats have said the government urgently needs to prepare for retaliatory tariff. Deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the UK steel industry was being left \"dangerously exposed\" to the \"devastating damage\" Trump's tariffs could inflict."

    "summary": "The surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate tariffs prompts questions over the possible impact on British businesses.",
    "story": [
      "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.",
      "Trump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.",
      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",
      "The use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.",
      "Trump launches plan to target countries with new tariffs",
      "UK not planning to hit back at US on steel tariffs",
      "UK signals it will seek US steel tariff exemption",
      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",
      "Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.",
      "But she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".",
      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",
      "Mr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".",
      "Senior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.",
      "\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\""

      "Alongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.",
      "A spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers.

      "Thames, which is in severe financial difficulties already, is also waiting for the courts to approve a \u00a33bn rescue from investors.",
      "But in the longer run, the company says bills also need to rise by more than Ofwat has suggested to cover the costs of investing in water infrastructure.",
      "The company, which provides water services in the south-east of England, said the appeal was \"in the interests of our customers and the environment\".",
      "Thames has argued bills need to rise by 53% over the five-year period.",
      "Its chairman, Sir Adrian Montague, said bigger bill rises would allow Thames to provide \"safe and resilient\" water supplies that could cope with the impact of climate change.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:54:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump wants US vehicles to be more popular in Europe, but it's a difficult market for them to crack.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?",
      "Italy's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".",
      "Or as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".",
      "Add cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.",
      "\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"",
      "Mr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.",
      "Yet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".",
      "In 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.",
      "This imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.",
      "\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.",
      "These disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.",
      "Trump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.",
      "Trump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.",
      "In fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.",
      "The automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".",
      "As such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.",
      "US carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.",
      "Meanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.",
      "After years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.",
      "Ford plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.",
      "Elon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.",
      "Europe is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"",
      "He also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.",
      "\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.",
      "He adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.",
      "Adding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.",
      "Mr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.",
      "Mr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.",
      "Not least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".",
      "\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

    "story": [
      "Two US lawmakers have strongly condemned what they call the UK's \"dangerous\"  and \"shortsighted\" request to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service.",
      "Senator Ron Wyden and Congressman Andy Biggs have written to national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard saying the demand threatens the privacy and security of the US.",
      "They urge her to give the UK an ultimatum: \"Back down from this dangerous attack on US cybersecurity, or face serious consequences.\"",

      "If the UK does not back down Ms Gabbard should \"reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as US intelligence sharing\", they suggest.",
      "What is the UK seeking?",
      "The request for the data emerged last week.",
      "It applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP).",
      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",
      "They state that Apple does not make different versions of its encryption software for each country it operates in and, therefore, Apple customers in the UK will use the same software as Americans.",
      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

      "The government has found a \"serious systemic\" issue in homes fitted with insulation under two of its own schemes since 2022 \u2013 and ordered installers to put it right.",
      "But that won't include 93-year-old Margaret Chappell whose work was done in 2021 and now her house is consumed by damp, black mould and crumbling plaster.",
      "The government said it would keep other schemes under review but Mrs Chappell said she and other residents were being ''ignored\".",
      "\"It's as if we don't exist. It's appalling,\" added Mrs Chappell, who has lived in her home in County Durham for 60 years.",
      "She and 153 of her neighbours in the town of Chilton had solid wall insulation fitted after Durham County Council advised them to take advantage of a free government scheme.",
      "They were told the work would help make their homes warmer and lower their energy bills. But Mrs Chappell, who suffers from chronic asthma, said that since then, damp has consumed her living room.",

      "More than three million homes in the UK have had insulation fitted under government schemes including 260,000 properties which have had solid wall insulation.",
      "In October, the BBC told the story of 84-year-old Tormuja Khatun from Luton whose house with unsuitable solid wall insulation had mushrooms growing on the walls and dry rot feeding off the floor joists.",

      "Not long after this BBC report, the government ordered an audit by the independent organisation Trustmark of more than 1,000 properties that have had solid wall insulation. It found that in half of the homes audited the work had not been done to the required standard.",

      "In Mr Walter's view the properties were unsuitable for solid wall insulation and said it would have to be removed from all of the properties. He warned this could cost tens of thousands of pounds per home to fix.",
      "He said the cost \"could actually exceed the market value'' of each house and added ''it just demonstrates what a catastrophic scheme it's been.''",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.",
      "On Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.",
      "In outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.",
      "While big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.",
      "Which countries could be affected?",
      "The memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days.",
      "Trump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April.",
      "Trump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.",
      "\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".",
      "\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"",
      "As well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports.",
      "Trump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.",
      "Still, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"",
      "In recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.",
      "Ahead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".",
      "\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good.",
      "Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "Historically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium.",
      "The US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.",
      "In setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US.",
      "The White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.",
      "But officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax.",
      "Those kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK.",
      "Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus.",
      "\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said.",
      "What impact could tariffs have on the economy?",
      "Thursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil. That is due to go into effect next month.",
      "He also raised tariffs on all goods from China to 10% and threatened to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with duties of 25%, a plan that has been put on hold until March.",
      "Shares on Wall Street rose after no immediate tariffs were announced.",
      "John Cassidy, chief executive of Red Cedar Investment Management, said Trump's string of rapid-fire tariff announcements had unnerved Wall Street, which \"does not like the unknown\".",
      "But he warned against over-reacting, noting that tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term had a relatively mild impact on the US economy.",
      "\"I think Trump's playing a hand here and I think he's got a very strong hand to play,\" he said.",
      "However, Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, said it remained to be seen what changes could result from Trump's moves.",
      "He does not think tariffs are the best strategy for dealing with trade complaints, given the costs and uncertainty they introduce for US firms and risks of retaliation.",
      "\"I think we're inching toward more and more tariffs with each coming week and further escalation of a trade war with other countries,\" he said.",
      "He noted that Trump in his first term walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that had been intended to address some of these same issues with countries in Asia.",
      "\"They were open to doing this without having to put the US through more trade uncertainty,\" he said.",
      "Trump has dismissed concerns about collateral economic damage, saying his plans will boost manufacturing in the US over the long term.",
      "\"What's going to go up is jobs are going to go up,\" he said. \"Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down.\"",
      "But surveys indicate the US public remains concerned about the cost of living and is unconvinced about the benefits of tariffs, which economists have warned are likely to lead to higher prices for US businesses and households.",
      "A recent Marquette Law School poll found just 24% of respondents believe tariffs will help the US economy, including just under half of Republicans and just 12% of independents and 4% of Democrats.",
      "\"The question is are these tariffs going to lead to higher inflation, higher costs of goods,\" said Charles Franklin, director of the poll. \"The fairness argument is probably a good argument for the president to make but the price impact is much more of a hard thing to sell\".",

      "The popular app, which is used by more than 170 million American users, went dark briefly last month in the US as the ban deadline approached.",
      "Trump then signed an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day extension to comply with a law banning the app if it is not sold.",
      "TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News.",
      "According to Bloomberg, which first reported TikTok's return to app stores in the US, the decision to resume its availability came after Apple and Google received assurances from the Trump administration that they would not be held liable for allowing downloads, and the ban wouldn't be enforced yet.",
      "The ban, which passed with a bipartisan vote in Congress, was signed into law by former President Joe Biden. It ordered TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the US version of the platform to a neutral party to avert an outright ban.",
      "The Biden administration had argued that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.",
      "China and TikTok have repeatedly denied those accusations. Beijing has also previously rejected calls for a sale of TikTok's US operations.",
      "The law banning the app was supported by US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and it was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump himself had supported banning the app during his first term in office but he appeared to have a change of heart last year during the presidential race.",

      "Airlines and hoteliers say Heathrow's funding model should be reformed before any investment is made in the proposed third runway.",
      "Businesses want a fundamental review of the regulations set by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that govern what Heathrow can charge. They say the current model makes Heathrow the most expensive airport in the world.",
      "If changes are not made, businesses say the third runway will not happen as it will be too expensive.",
      "The CAA said it would \"carefully consider\" conducting a review of Heathrow's economic regulatory model.",
      "A Heathrow source said that the airport management had already told airlines and the government that it would propose to look at a different, longer-term regulatory model for a third runway.",
      "But, as with other goods that consumers buy, those who use a service or product have to pay for the cost of providing or producing it as is the case today.",
      "Surinder Arora is the chair of Arora group which owns 16 hotels and lots of land around the airport. He is pro-expansion but he has his doubts it will happen.",
      "He told BBC London that Heathrow is overcharging for many items.",
      "For example, he says he pays 2.62p a unit for a unit of water at the Renaissance Hotel which is outside the Heathrow Airport boundary.",
      "At his Hilton hotel next to Terminal 2, within the boundary, he pays Heathrow Airport a lot more - 23.27p a unit. That high price is passed on to his customers.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

      "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas.",
      "Modi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.",
      "While both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\".",
      "The Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US.",

      "\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said.",

      "\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit.",
      "Trump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets.",
      "The two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".",
      "Modi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US.",
      "Last week, US deported on a military plane 104 Indians accused of being illegal immigrants, with a video showing deportees in shackles. A second flight is expected to land in India on Saturday.",
      "Indians are one of the largest populations of unauthorised immigrants in the US. They also hold the majority of H-1B visas - a programme that Trump had temporarily banned during his first term and is now coming under fresh scrutiny.",
      "Shortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.",
      "He acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".",
      "Trump told reporters that \"our allies are worse than our enemies\", when it comes to import taxes.",
      "\"We had a very unfair system to us,\" the Republican president said before meeting Modi. \"Everybody took advantage of the United States.\"",
      "The White House also issued a news release that fired a trade shot across the bows of India and other countries.",
      "The document noted that the average US tariff on agricultural goods was 5% for countries to which Washington had granted most favoured nation (MFN) status.",
      "\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said.",
      "\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"",
      "Trump has already placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, citing its production of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has stoked a US overdose epidemic.",
      "He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days.",

      "But Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC that the UK had a strong case to avoid the border taxes, given the amounts Britain exported to the US were small in comparison to other countries and because the steel was used in areas such as defence.",

      "The government has said it would not retaliate immediately to new measures announced this week, despite many in the steel industry calling on Britain to join the European Union and Canada who have said they will hit back against the policy.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",

      "He said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".",

      "Rachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.",
      "The chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.",
      "However, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.",
      "They said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.",
      "Speaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir still thought the chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",

      "A former HR lead for the bank who helped with Reeves's relocation also said she could recall her first day and it was in March 2006.",
      "In a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"",
      "In a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\"",
      "She said the same thing in a speech at a CEO summit in July 2022, and in a video posted on her Facebook page in the same month.",
      "The claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".",
      "As she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).",
      "Last year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.",
      "Reeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.",

      "The UK economy unexpectedly grew in the final three months of last year following a boost to the construction and services sectors.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, according to official figures, despite analysts predicting it would contract.",
      "Growth in the quarter was driven by a range of industries, from pubs and bars to machinery manufacturers, having a strong December.",
      "However, the figures also indicated living standards last year were slightly lower than in 2023 on average.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "The Bank of England has also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year, amid concerns that higher costs for employers could hit hiring, profits, investment - and push up prices. Last week, it decided to cut interest rates to 4.5%.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was \"all-but stagnating\" as businesses adjusted for higher costs and \"more uncertainty overseas\" - pointing to the introduction of trade tariffs in the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "He said it was a clear that \"a lot of the weakness\" in the economy was due to the rise in taxes on firms announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her Budget last year, with \"business sentiment on the floor\" and investment and consumer spending down.",
      "\"Overall, the economy is unlikely to do more than move sideways over the next six months,\" he suggested.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "But the latest figures showing a return to growth at the end of 2024 will be welcome news for the government, which has made growing the economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "A separate figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measuring living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared with the year before. The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.",
      "When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "All this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.",
      "In December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.",
      "Film distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.",
      "However, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.",
      "In the construction sector, the final months of 2024 saw an increase in new work driven by new private housing projects, but repairs and maintenance work from private homes fell over the period, suggesting homeowners cut back.",
      "'People don't have the money'",
      "Sushma Solanki, the owner of Bolton catering firm Sushma's Snacks, told the BBC the economic situation was \"very worrying\" as she found trading at the end of last year very tough.",
      "\"I normally do about 20 to 30 Christmas office events,\" she said. \"Instead, I did two, which was very hard. People don't have the money.\"",
      "She said she had to let go an employee partly because of the upcoming rise in National Insurance.",
      "\"It's not just the policies, it's everything. Peppers for my chicken dish started off at 79p, they are \u00a31.85,\" she added.",
      "Chris Taylor, the owner of coffee shop Gran T's in Manchester, said he was \"shocked\" that there had been any growth in the economy.",
      "\"Going into last winter was one of the biggest struggles. I think a lot of people were naturally clinging onto their purse strings. Trade was not there,\" he said.",
      "\"This government's action plan, without hitting people directly with higher taxes, is hitting the level above and that effectively is going to hit people one way or another. It is really an indirect punch to the whole economy.\"",
      "Following the release of the new figures, the chancellor said she was still not satisfied with the performance of the economy.",
      "\"It's not possible to turn around more than a decade of poor economic performance in just a few months, but we are doing what is necessary to bring stability to the economy,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also said the government was going \"further and faster\" to \"put more money in people's pockets\".",
      "She also reiterated her self-imposed rules on borrowing and debt were \"non-negotiable\" after reports this week suggested the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had downgraded growth forecasts.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget was \"killing growth\" in the UK.",
      "\"Working people and businesses are already paying for her choices with ever rocketing taxes, hundreds of thousands of job cuts and business confidence plummeting,\" he added.",

      "A 25% tax is set to be imposed on all imports of steel and aluminium into the US , ending exemptions from the rules for goods from major trade partners including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, as well as the European Union.",
      "The expanded tariff measures announced by President Donald Trump, expected to go into effect next month, will mean many US businesses wanting to bring the metals into the country will have to pay more.",
      "But there is a risk that the companies will pass on the added costs, or some portion of it, to consumers.",
      "Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "1. Canned food, beer and fizzy drinks",
      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",
      "After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won \"exclusions\" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.",
      "Since then, steel manufacturers have cut production further, pushing up prices, warned the CMI, which sent a letter to the Trump administration earlier this month signed by big food companies including General Mills, Del Monte and Goya.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the CMI, said without exemptions for can manufacturers to import steel tariff free, grocery prices for canned foods made in the US are likely to rise.",
      "\"While the president may believe that these tariffs are protecting the steel industry, they certainly are undermining our food security and our supply resiliency for American canned food, which Americans rely on every day,\" Mr Budway said.",
      "When it comes to aluminium, brewers and makers of fizzy drinks, such as Coca-Cola, have also warned the move will add costs and could lead to higher prices for customers.",
      "\"We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,\" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.",
      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "2. Cars",
      "After Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium during his first term, carmakers including Ford and General Motors warned the measures would add about $1bn to each of their costs.",
      "For customers, Morningstar estimated the tariff costs back then would result in a roughly 1%, or a $300 price rise for customers.",
      "David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, warned Ford could be facing a similar cost increase this time, but said it was unclear how consumers will be affected.",
      "Affordability pressures in a market where sales have yet to return to 2019 levels could limit how much of the costs companies choose to pass on, according to Michael Wall, an auto analyst at S&P Global Mobility.",
      "But he said it was still \"realistic\" to expect some of the costs from the metals tariffs to trickle down to buyers.",
      "However he noted that Trump's announcement of tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, currently on hold until March, would have a much bigger impact for buyers.",
      "At a business conference, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned Trump's recent moves were causing \"a lot of cost and a lot of chaos\" for his industry.",
      "TD Economics has estimated cars could go up in price by about $3,000 if blanket tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada came into force.",
      "3. Construction, housing and appliances",
      "The construction industry as a sector is one of the single biggest users of steel, which developers and homebuilders need for everything from building frames to appliances.",
      "Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran \"totally counter\" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.",
      "\"Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" he warned.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",
      "After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.",
      "Companies unable to absorb such costs would likely pass them on through higher prices in the shops."

    "summary": "US inflation increased by more than expected last month, pushing up the cost of living for Americans.",
    "story": [
      "US inflation increased by more than expected last month, as higher egg and energy prices helped to push up the cost of living for Americans.",
      "Inflation rose to 3% in January, its highest rate for six months, and above the 2.9% expected by economists.",
      "The rise comes weeks after the US central bank decided to hold interest rates, saying there was significant uncertainty about where the economy might be headed.",
      "It poses a challenge to US President Donald Trump, who made tackling inflation a centrepiece of his election campaign last year, but has put forward policies, such as higher tariffs on imports, that economists say risk pushing up prices.",
      "Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the latest report could put pressure on Trump to reconsider those plans, which would raise taxes on goods entering the country.",
      "\"Tariffs can still be used as a bargaining tool to get some concessions from other countries, but the political optics of putting even a little upward pressure on consumer prices via tariffs wouldn't be great for the Trump administration,\" he wrote.",
      "The uptick in prices last month was wide-ranging, affecting car insurance, airfare, medicine and other basics.",
      "Grocery prices climbed 0.5% over the month, compared with 0.3% in December, as egg prices surged more than 15% amid shortages caused by outbreak of avian flu.",
      "That marked the biggest monthly increase in nearly a decade, the Labor Department said.",
      "Prices for clothing, by contrast, declined, while rents and other housing related costs increased 4.4% over the last year, marking the smallest 12-month increase since January 2022.",
      "Core inflation, which strips out food and energy and is seen by analysts as a better measure of underlying trends, was 0.4% over the month, the fastest pace since March.",
      "\"This is not a good number,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.",
      "\"It illustrates how the [Federal Reserve] has not completed the job of getting inflation back down just as new inflation risks - from tariff hikes and a squeeze on labor supply growth - start to emerge.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve raised interest rates sharply starting in 2022, hoping higher borrowing costs would cool the economy and ease pressures that were pushing up prices.",
      "It had started cutting rates in September, saying it wanted to avoid any further cooling.",
      "But signs of persistent inflation above the bank's 2% target in recent months prompted it to keep interest rates unchanged in January.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Three American goods that could rise in price due to metal tariffs",
      "Has Trump promised too much on US economy?",
      "Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell told Congress this week that the bank was in little hurry to cut rates further.",
      "He noted that it remained unclear how Trump's tariff plans would shape the Fed's policies, since the measures could prompt a slowdown in the economy, alongside a rise in prices.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump called on the Fed to lower interest rates to go \"hand-in-hand\" with tariffs.",
      "But some analysts said after the report that they were no longer expecting any rate cuts this year.",
      "Wall Street stocks ended the day mostly lower, while interest rates charged on US government debt climbed as investors bet that borrowing costs would remain higher for longer.",
      "Meanwhile, Randy Kroszner, a former Federal Reserve Board member questioned whether prices would rise enough for Trump to change course.",
      "\"When President Trump was in office the previous time, he did raise tariffs on steel and aluminium and there was very little impact on overall prices,\" Mr Kroszner said in an interview with BBC News.",
      "\"So it's unclear whether this would be bigger this time. I mean if it does lead to sort of a global trade war, then they'll have a bigger impact. But trade is a relatively small part of the US economy. That's one of the reasons that President Trump has chosen to focus on this.\""

    "summary": "The bank ditches a policy that stopped it acting on flotations for firms with an all male, all white board.",
    "story": [
      "Goldman Sachs' vice chair has said the bank ditched an internal diversity rule that barred it from advising all male, all white boards on company flotations because it was no longer needed.",
      "The investment bank had pledged that it would only help a business sell its shares on a stock exchange if it had two board members that satisfied diversity requirements, one of whom had to be a woman.",
      "But Richard Gnodde told the BBC: \"That policy was put in place to try and drive a change in behaviour and I think that's happened.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging interview, he also said the UK government needed to get on and start infrastructure projects now.",
      "Goldman Sachs introduced its diversity policy on boards in 2020, initially mandating that companies who wanted to float had to have one diverse member, before increasing it to two people.",
      "Mr Gnodde said: \"I think what is important is that you have a diversity of views on that board and if you look at these companies they've all embraced diversity, it's moved along.",
      "\"I think it has served its purpose.\"",
      "According to think tank The Conference Board, although US boards are \"more diverse than ever\", there was a \"marked slowdown\" in racial diversity hiring on boards between 2022 and 2024.",
      "Among the 500 largest US firms, the share of non-white directors was 26% and the share of women directors was 34% in 2024, according to the think tank.",

      "Asked whether firms were stepping back from policies around diversity because of the Trump White House, Mr Gnodde said: \"I can only speak for ourselves, I don't think that's the case.",
      "\"Our ambitions are to continue to take things forward and frankly to go much further than we have been.\"",
      "'Animal spirits'",
      "However, he conceded that uncertainty caused by Trump's policy on trade tariffs was weighing on companies' \"animal spirits\" and their appetite for investment.",
      "\"I think right now, the mood is on the margin [is] a little tempered, because people are uncertain about exactly what the policy outcome will be and exactly what the impacts will be,\" said Mr Gnodde.",

      "However, these projects are not expected to be completed for a number of years.",

    "summary": "The advertising watchdog says it was \"irresponsible\" to emphasise the thinness of the model's legs.",
    "story": [
      "An advert by fashion brand Next has been banned because the model's pose and the camera angle gave the impression she was \"unhealthily thin\".",
      "The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) compared the advert with other photos of the same model and did not think she looked unhealthily thin in those.",
      "But it said in the now-banned image, emphasising the thinness of the model's legs using camera angles, pose and styling was \"irresponsible\".",
      "Next said it disagreed with the advertising watchdog's decision and said the model, while slim, had a \"healthy and toned physique\".",
      "In response to the ASA, the retailer said the 5'9\" model's pose was chosen \"specifically to display the leggings' fit on both straight and bent legs\", and that the image, which was shot nearly two years ago, was created with a \"strong sense of responsibility\".",
      "A spokesperson added a Next stylist and product image manager met the model in person and \"did not have any concerns about her health\".",
      "In its ruling, the ASA acknowledged the model's face \"did not appear to be gaunt and her arms, while slim, did not display any protruding bones\".",
      "But it said: \"Because the pose, camera angle and styling in the ad investigated strongly emphasised the slimness of the model's legs, we considered that the ad gave the impression that the model was unhealthily thin.\"",
      "Next said it had not used digital retouching to alter the model's appearance but did digitally alter the appearance of the leggings by bringing them down further towards the model's ankle on both legs.",
      "This was not said to alter the model's natural proportions.",
      "The ASA told Next that its advert breached the code for social responsibility.",
      "It said the ad must not appear again in its current form, and that Next  should ensure the images in their ads were \"prepared responsibly and did not portray models as being unhealthily thin.\"",
      "\"You do wonder how it got through,\" fashion journalist Victoria Moss told BBC Breakfast.",

      "The \"body positivity\" movement which began around 2010 focused particularly on promoting a more diverse range of models.",
      "But Ms Moss told BBC Breakfast she thinks the body positivity movement is \"slightly under threat\".",
      "\"The wider industry is veering towards a very thin model look,\" she said.",
      "Adding: \"With a rise of weight loss injection drugs there's a rise of talk in the media of people taking these drugs and I think that's really pushed this idea of everyone has to be thin much more to the fore again.\"",

    "title": "Germany's once-mighty car industry is in crisis. What will it take to fix it?",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:33:37 GMT",
    "summary": "With the economy a key factor in German elections this month, can the auto sector get back on the road to recovery?",
    "story": [

      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

      "Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied.",
      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",
      "Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut.",
      "\"Kindness is cool,\" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.",
      "Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money.",
      "\"I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story\u2026 and often the people who have the least give the most,\" says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers.",
      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",
      "\"Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",
      "She explains that the videos often involve someone being identified as \"in need\". They are then asked for a favour. It might be spare money for a bus fare or help with something.",
      "She argues the participant is being \"lured\" into valuing the needs of someone else, who appears richer, more highly than their own.",
      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him \"feel weird\".",
      "Sometimes large amounts of money are given to vulnerable people, which they might not be in a position to manage.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump has proposed a sweeping set of tariffs. Does this mark the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.",
      "The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",

      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",

      "Schools across Stoke-on-Trent are caught up in an increasingly bitter row over repairs, with some telling the BBC they've had to fight to get work done while paying \"astronomical\" charges over 25 years.",
      "The city's schools are all locked into a multi-million-pound Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract, meaning they pay a company to keep their buildings in good condition.",
      "The agreement is due to end in October, when schools fear the private firm will walk away, leaving behind a huge repair bill for work not completed.",
      "BBC News has been investigating the row for more than a year, visiting multiple schools in the city, using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and analysing documents.",
      "We can exclusively reveal 42 of the 88 schools involved are now withholding payments to the contract. The investigation also found:",
      "35 of those schools received a letter from Stoke-on-Trent City Council threatening them with legal action in JanuarySchools were also told at the end of January that there was not enough money left to complete all the repairs required before the contract endsNone of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",

      "Schools were also told at the end of January that there was not enough money left to complete all the repairs required before the contract ends",
      "None of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",
      "The contract was signed in 2000 between Stoke-on-Trent City Council and a firm called Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited (TSSL). It uses multinational company Equans to maintain the facilities.",
      "The contract is the largest of its kind in England and will be among the first PFI deals in the country to expire. After the deal ends, the private company will have no further liability.",
      "What happens next has implications for the expiry of almost 600 similar deals covering schools and hospitals across England.",
      "Stoke City Council said its priority was to get the schools handed over \"safe, warm and dry\", while the main contractor engaged under the PFI contract, Equans, said the buildings had been well maintained.",
      "At Our Lady and St Benedict primary, more than half the children are from families on the very lowest incomes. When the BBC visited the school last month, part of one classroom was cordoned off with hazard tape because plaster was falling off the walls. There was a hole in the ceiling and the wall was damp to touch.",
      "The BBC has seen evidence the school has spent years chasing this and other repairs, which under the terms of the maintenance contract have to be done through Equans.",
      "Head teacher Sarah Clowes says the school's floors and windows are among almost 300 issues staff have identified - but the heating is her biggest headache.",
      "A new boiler, fitted under the contract last summer, broke down when the first cold snap arrived, and the youngest children had to be sent home for three days because the building was so cold. Pupils in Year 6 remained at school, but had to wear their coats during lessons. When the heating broke down again in January, the school was unable to open and all the pupils had to stay at home.",
      "Since the BBC approached Equans for comment last week, the damp plaster has been removed and repairs have begun. The school told us despite further repairs the heating is still not working in every classroom.",
      "A few miles away, at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy, the exterior render on the building is stained green with damp and is coming away in places. Inside, there is a huge stain where water comes through from the roof to the ground floor.",
      "The BBC has also seen evidence of months of delays to fix three pumps that supply the school with water. Only one is working - and if it breaks the school says it will have to close because there would be no clean water for taps and toilets.",
      "BBC News contacted Equans about the issue and the school has since been assured the pumps will be replaced during a school holiday.",
      "Ian Beardmore, chief executive of Newman Catholic Collegiate - a group of six primaries and one secondary in the Stoke PFI contract - describes the charges his schools have been paying for the past 25 years as \"astronomical\".",
      "He says the annual maintenance fee for a plug socket installed in one primary school staff room was \u00a3400, and when he asked for the socket to be removed the school was charged \u00a3500.",
      "Mr Beardmore says there are \u00a31.8m of repairs that need to be carried out across his seven schools, which have been identified in expiry surveys carried out to assess their condition as the maintenance contract nears its end. Some work has already been classed as too expensive or not essential, he says.",
      "\"There's no money, there's no will to do it, and there's no time in order to put these things into place,\" he says. \"It's going to leave us severely out of pocket - and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.\"",
      "The BBC has seen a letter, sent by Stoke-on-Trent City Council to all 88 schools in the Stoke contract, saying it \"remains concerned\" the PFI company \"may not have sufficient funding available to them to complete all of the handback works\".",
      "It will need to \"reprioritise\" work not already agreed, the letter continues, and target repairs which will leave all schools \"in a safe, warm and dry condition\" by the end of the contract.",
      "Schools have told the BBC it is not clear how these priorities will be agreed or by whom. The council subsequently said schools would be consulted.",

      "Investors make \u00a3140m from PFI deals",

      "However, the BBC investigation suggests little money has been held back, despite concerns from the schools.",
      "The BBC analysed 25 years of published financial accounts for the PFI company TSSL and found \u00a3416,000 had been declared as deductions from the contract since 2014. In most years this was less than 1% of the fees.",
      "Using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, BBC News also found that no money has been passed on to schools for contract failures over the last 25 years.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council told us it was still working through these payments, and they would be paid to schools before October.",
      "The BBC shared its data with Ian Dennison, whose consultancy firm Inscyte is advising the schools fighting to get repairs done in Stoke. His company has worked on PFI school contracts across England.",
      "Mr Dennison told the BBC the level of deductions in Stoke were \"shockingly low\" compared with similar contracts for PFI schools across England.",
      "Time is running out for repairs to be carried out in Stoke's PFI schools and Mr Dennison is not confident the buildings will be handed back in a satisfactory condition.",
      "\"We believe that there's a really serious problem about to emerge around what works can be completed in time,\" Mr Dennison says.",
      "Putting buildings right at the end of contract is part of what the high yearly payments in PFI are intended to ensure.",
      "Inscyte says the expiry surveys carried out for Stoke City Council and TSSL show the total repairs would cost millions.",
      "The use of PFI deals increased significantly under Tony Blair's Labour government as a way of investing in public buildings without the government borrowing money up front. Under the deals, long-term agreements between the private and public sector were made.",
      "In Stoke, the contract mainly covered maintaining existing school buildings, with a bit of new build. Elsewhere, completely new schools were built under PFI.",
      "In 2018, the Conservative government scrapped the controversial PFI model after growing concerns it did not provide value for public money. But around 570 PFI contracts, including many to maintain and update school and hospital buildings, remained in place. Many are now nearing their end.",
      "Five years ago the National Audit Office (NAO) - which scrutinises value for public money - warned of a risk of schools and hospitals being handed back in a poor condition if the final stage of these maintenance contracts wasn't properly managed.",
      "As contracts begin to wind down, the NAO said there is a disincentive for the private companies to spend money before they hand over responsibility for maintaining the buildings to public bodies.",
      "In order to avoid this happening the government says \"expiry health checks\" should be carried out on buildings.",
      "In response to an FOI request, the Cabinet Office confirmed expiry health checks were carried out on Stoke's PFI schools in March 2021 and March 2024.",
      "Their condition was given the second worst rating, \"amber/red\", which means \"major additional work\" was needed.",
      "The BBC asked the council, Equans and TSSL to comment on its findings.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council said there had been a \"large amount of investment to maintain and improve these schools over the last 25 years\", which it claims means they are in a better condition than many schools elsewhere.",
      "The council said recent high inflation had made repairs more expensive, but it would not agree to responsibility for buildings being handed back unless standards set out in the contract were met.",
      "The council said more than half the work by value had been completed, and it was drawing up plans in case not all the work can be finished.",
      "Equans said it has been \"committed to ensuring Stoke's schools have been well-maintained throughout the 25 years of the contract\". It said an average of 28,000 jobs have been completed across the schools every year, with 93% of planned and preventative tasks being completed on time and, for the rest of this year, \"a busy schedule of work for the school holidays was planned\".",
      "Some work on the damaged render at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy is now due to be carried out over Easter, the BBC understands.",
      "Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited said the schools had been maintained \"in accordance with the contract\", adding that many of the school buildings were relatively old when it took over responsibility.",
      "It said \"all parties are working together to deliver the maintenance works by the contract expiry date\", adding that the schools were involved in the sign-off process and it was unaware of any dispute between the council and the schools and \"unaware of widespread issues with quality\".",

    "story": [
      "Long-term plans need to be drawn up for Scotland's schools to reflect falling pupil numbers, a think tank has said.",
      "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there could be 90,000 fewer pupils in the country's classrooms by 2040 - and suggested that teacher numbers could be cut as a result.",
      "The group said this could eventually free up \u00a3500m per year, but the government has flatly rejected the idea.",
      "Teaching unions have hit out too, with the EIS saying cutting teacher numbers \"lacks any educational rationale\" and the NASUWT calling it a \"false economy\" that would damage life chances and Scotland's future prosperity.",
      "But when you consider the falling birth rate and demographic changes alongside the need to get the maximum benefit out of every pound spent on services, is it time to talk about teacher numbers?",
      "School staffing is a frequent topic of dispute between politicians - usually in terms of demands for more of them, not fewer.",
      "The SNP pledged in its 2021 manifesto to increase teacher numbers by 3,500.",
      "So when it was revealed in December that the figure had actually fallen, opposition leaders were quick to give the first minister a hard time about it.",
      "John Swinney pledged to get teacher numbers back to 2023 levels, and keeping them there is the government's new goal.",
      "But pupil numbers are already starting to plateau, and are projected to drop sharply over the coming decades.",
      "That's why the Institute for Fiscal Studies argues that perhaps it would be OK to allow teacher numbers to go down in line with that, rather than holding them at 2023 levels.",
      "The government has flatly rejected the report's conclusions.",
      "But much of the picture it paints is actually pretty positive.",
      "The IFS underlines that class sizes in Scotland are smaller than those elsewhere in the UK - averaging about 13 pupils per teacher, compared with 17 to 19 pupils per teacher down south.",
      "Spending per pupil is also rising, and is the highest in the UK - 20% higher than it is in England.",
      "But on both counts that can be explained in part by the number of pupils rising far more sharply south of the border. Scotland is set to have the opposite problem.",
      "The stickiest issue for the government is that these smaller class sizes and higher spending hasn't necessarily led to notably better outcomes.",
      "Scotland's struggle in international comparisons of school performance has been well documented. There has been a long-term decline in reading, maths and science, and Covid has hardly helped.",
      "The gap in attainment between pupils from more and less affluent backgrounds also remains stubbornly unclosed, almost a decade on from it being made the government's \"number one priority\".",
      "The IFS argument is that continuing to plough money into school staffing against a backdrop of falling school rolls isn't the most cost-effective way to improve things.",
      "Pupil numbers are projected to fall by 90,000 by 2040. If teacher numbers hold steady at 2023 levels, then the pupil-teacher ratio will fall closer to 12 - the lowest ever.",
      "But IFS research economist Darcey Snape says smaller class sizes \"only tend to have modest effects on pupil attainment\".",
      "Her analysis suggests that letting teacher numbers fall could free up funds - up to \u00a3500m per year by 2040 - either for other areas of schooling, or indeed for other badly-stretched budgets such as social care.",
      "Ms Snape accepts there would inevitably be \"practical difficulties\", like amalgamating classes and schools as rolls fall - but says local councils are arguably best placed to make these decisions, \"rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach across Scotland\".",
      "The latter point is already the subject of some dispute between schools and councils.",
      "Ultimately councils are the employers, and control the overall numbers - the government can only enforce its policy by holding carrots and sticks over them.",
      "Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth has clashed with council leaders by threatening to withdraw funding which was offered on the basis of keeping numbers at 2023 levels.",
      "A deal has just been struck with Glasgow City Council, which was planning on cutting 450 posts over a three-year period - which in turn had led to strike threats from unions.",
      "Groups representing teachers are predictably negative about the IFS's report, calling it a \"false economy\" and a \"race to the bottom\".",
      "The EIS and NASUWT say things aren't as straightforward in schools as the report might make out.",
      "Both make the point that the number of pupils with additional support needs has risen to record levels. They need more support, not less, and cutting teacher numbers would \"further entrench existing inequalities\" in their prospects.",
      "They also point to the fact teachers already have \"excessive workloads and working hours\", and face issues with anti-social behaviour and even violence in classrooms.",
      "It is absolutely fair to argue that long-term planning needs to be done, to take account of shifting demographics.",
      "The ever-increasing strain on care services provides a prime example of why we need to be ready for the ways in which society will change.",
      "Perhaps we do need to have a grown-up debate about the best and most cost-effective way to improve outcomes in schools.",
      "But when the headline is getting rid of teachers, it's always going to be difficult to sell the idea to politicians who face an election in just over a year.",
      "The Scottish government has already flatly rejected the idea, saying teachers play a central role in driving improvements in schools.",
      "And as noted above, opposition parties are chiefly interested in holding ministers to account on their promised increases. Nobody is going to put cutting teacher numbers on a leaflet.",
      "And it's particularly tough to get MSPs to stick their necks out when we're talking about something which will be an issue in 2040, which feels pretty distant.",
      "But a year is famously a long time in politics, and 15 of them is an eternity. Look back 15 years and Gordon Brown was prime minister and the SNP were being propped up by the Conservatives at Holyrood.",
      "If one thing is guaranteed, it's change; it's incredibly unlikely that we will reach 2040 with the current policy structure intact.",
      "Unless something also shifts in terms of Scotland's birth rate and the pace of demographic change, decisions are going to be needed sooner or later."

      "A strike by teachers in Glasgow has been suspended following talks between unions and the city council.",
      "Members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) teaching union were to walk out on 20 February unless ongoing education cuts were halted and reversed.",
      "The EIS said strike action has been suspended following an offer from the Glasgow City Council SNP group to withdraw future planned education cuts and a promise to use Scottish government funding to increase teacher numbers to 2023 levels.",
      "Glasgow City Council originally planned to axe 450 posts over a three-year period as part of a savings drive, with around 120 roles already scrapped.",
      "More stories from Glasgow & West Scotland",
      "More stories from Scotland",
      "The EIS previously argued the cuts would harm teaching standards and create heavier workloads for staff.",
      "A letter sent to the union by the SNP's Allan Casey, the councillor in charge of workforce, says \u00a317m over two years will be found elsewhere to cover the cost.",
      "Mr Casey wrote: \"I hope you agree that it represents a significant commitment to our teaching workforce and to the quality of education in the city. I hope this will be welcome news to your members.\"",
      "He also said that additional funding from the Scottish government would be used on increasing the number of teachers in the city, and that the SNP were \"hopeful\" other parties would back the proposal.",
      "Following discussion on the offer letter, Glasgow EIS local association secretary Jane Gow said the offer represents a \"strong result\" for members and young people.",
      "She added: \"While the offer is not yet binding, and still has to pass through the full processes of council and be confirmed in next week's budget, the EIS is suspending strike action as an act of good faith while this process continues to its conclusion.",
      "\"As ever, the EIS will be paying close attention to ensure that the promises outlined in the letter become hard and fast commitments.\"",
      "Parents concerned over proposals",
      "The union will have a mandate to go on strike again within six months if it looks like the cuts are being reintroduced or the budget is not going to pass.",
      "However, the SNP group's size means it is unlikely to fail.",
      "Glasgow City Council previously said no teachers in permanent jobs would be made redundant and that savings would come from not filling vacant posts or by reducing staff on temporary contracts.",
      "The local authority said it needed to look at every option to make savings, as the education budget covers more than half the local authority's direct expenditure",
      "Deputy council leader and city treasurer Richard Bell told BBC News council funding from the Scottish government was \"higher than anticipated\" when the initial three-year plan was set.",
      "He said the additional funds had allowed the council to take teacher savings off the table but acknowledged there was still work to be done on balancing the books for future years.",
      "He added: \"We will have to work very hard with the government to ensure the settlement that we get next year is of a decent size.",
      "\"We've said to the EIS we will produce a roadmap on how we get to that figure and will be in consultation with them. It will be about adjusting the formula.",
      "\"So, we are still working on the financial solution to that but we've given them a commitment to take the big teacher savings off the table.\"",
      "Last year the Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth revealed she had not allowed the \u00a3145.5m which was set aside to maintain teacher numbers to be paid to councils.",
      "This was because some - including Glasgow - had cut teacher numbers.",
      "However, in December Cosla and the Scottish government signed an official agreement to maintain teacher numbers and freeze learning hours.",
      "Parents had argued the proposed cuts would disproportionately impact children with additional support needs and those living in poverty.",

      "When the pupil reported the abuse in 2017, Ms McMaster was in a new role with the Chiltern Learning Trust, which runs a chain of schools not including Holywell Middle.",

      "The TRA panel concluded she would have been aware the pupil had informed another member of staff she was being abused by her stepfather.",
      "In a police statement, the pupil claimed the abuse escalated in the weeks after her disclosure to the school.",
      "Ms McMaster, who had written the school's safeguarding policy, confirmed during her testimony there were missed opportunities to protect the pupil.",
      "In her witness statement she stated: \"In this situation, the disclosure should have been reported to the police and [the Local authority designated officer], and the pupil kept in school and not allowed to return home.",
      "\"This would have prevented further abuse.\"",
      "The hearing considered that the former teacher had not been subject to any other disciplinary hearings during her career and had positive references from past colleagues.",
      "It also noted that though Ms McMaster had not worked in teaching since 2019, she has used the time to reflect on how she \"could have dealt with matters differently and has taken full accountability for her conduct\".",
      "The panel concluded a teaching ban would have been an inappropriate response and the publication of their findings was enough to tell the teacher her standards of behaviour were not acceptable.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:34 GMT",
    "summary": "As clips from Spain's Temptation Island go viral, the BBC speaks to the show's executive producer.",
    "story": [
      "Reality TV gold has a new three-word definition: \"Montoya, por favor!\"",
      "If you've been anywhere near social media over the past fortnight, you'll know the raw drama setting the internet ablaze this award season hasn't come from Hollywood, but the love tragedy played out in clips posted from Spanish reality TV show Temptation Island.",
      "Contestant Jose Carlos Montoya's spiralling meltdown at watching his girlfriend Anita cheat with another man is like an uncensored Love Island on steroids.",
      "In Temptation Island, couples are taken to a tropical island, separated and sent to separate villas filled with attractive singles ready to test their loyalty. In a final twist, every move made is recorded for the other half to see.",
      "Forced to watch a graphic real-time stream of the betrayal, Montoya's emotions swell until he snaps, breaking all the show's rules.",
      "Blind to the now infamous pleas of host Sandra Barneda (\"Montoya, por favor!\"), he rampages down the beach to confront the pair, tugging at his shorts in anguish as lightning streaks across the sky.",
      "A second clip shows the resulting confrontation: Anita flips the script, calling out Montoya's own indiscretions before collapsing in tears, begging for forgiveness.",
      "\"This is cinema,\" wrote one X user, posting a clip that has now been watched on the platform a staggering 224 million times since 4 February.",
      "\"Montoya. The tension... you don't need to speak Spanish to understand, this is insane.\"",
      "Yet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the \"completely unexpected\" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability.",
      "\"In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,\" he says. \"I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked.",
      "\"Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask, what would I do in that situation?\"",
      "The magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. \"Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,\" he says.",
      "Gonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a \"special man\". At 31, he told casters he'd \"never experienced love like this before\", having been with Anita \"every day for a year\".",
      "\"She's a strong woman with a lot of character,\" Gonzalo adds.",
      "The Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's \"authentic emotion\" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked.",
      "Seeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea.",

      "But that's not all the week has in store.",
      "The next season of The White Lotus is here, EastEnders turns 40, video games Avowed and Lost Records: Bloom and Rage are released, and Tate McRae\u2019s new album is also coming out.",
      "Read on for this week's biggest releases...",
      "Sam Fender is People Watching",
      "By Mark Savage, Music correspondent",
      "Sam Fender made me cry twice last week.",
      "The first time, it was with the video for his single People Watching, starring Sherlock's Andrew Scott as a man trying and failing to grapple with the loss of his mother.",
      "He followed that up with another heart-tugging video, for Remember My Name, in which Dave Johns (from I, Daniel Blake) plays an elderly man caring for his wife as her health fails. Beautifully shot and delicately told, these stories would bring a lump to anyone's throat.",
      "Death and loss loom large over Fender's new album, which is released Friday and is also called People Watching. He says it was inspired by his trips to and from a palliative care home to visit his friend and mentor, Annie Orwin, who he's described as being like \"a surrogate mother\" to him.",
      "\"She was the one that gave me the confidence to go on stage, and always used to be like 'why haven't you mentioned my name in your acceptance speech',\" he wrote on Instagram last year. \"But now an entire song (and album) connects to her. I hope that wherever she is now she's looking down saying 'about time kid'.\"",
      "If that leaves you expecting mawkish sentiment and introspective wallowing, you've not been paying attention. Fender is one of our finest songwriters, with a sharp eye for detail and a heartland rock style that turn even the bleakest observations into rousing stadium anthems.",
      "Standout tracks on his new album (which is produced by The War On Drugs' Adam Granduciel) include the chiming riffs of Nostalgia's Lie, which explores the false allure of living in the past; and Crumbling Empire, whose lyrics draw parallels between the de-industrialisation and urban decay of Detroit and Fender's hometown of North Shields.",
      "Pensive, melodic, uplifting, and heartrending \u2013 it's his best album yet.",
      "The White Lotus is back",
      "Obnoxious guests, secrets and lies: that's right, The White Lotus is back.",
      "The third series of the comedy-drama that satirises the super rich is available for UK viewers to watch on Sky from Monday.",
      "While the first season focused on privilege, and the second season on sex, the show's creator Mike White has said this latest offering will look at spirituality - or what passes for it - at a wellness retreat in Thailand.",
      "\"The kind of stories that these characters are facing are a little bit more existential and tragic. It has a little bit more of an operatic, dramatic dimension,\" he said.",
      "For me, the big question is whether the show can deliver the same punch without needy heiress Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge).",
      "She became the breakout character from the previous two seasons, and the source of many of the best memes from the show.",
      "EastEnders turns 40",
      "It's a huge week for EastEnders as the soap celebrates its 40th birthday.",
      "To mark the moment, a special hour-long episode will air on Wednesday, the anniversary date itself.",
      "That will be followed by a full live episode on Thursday where audiences will get to decide whether Denise Fox reunites with estranged husband Jack or picks secret lover Ravi Gulati instead.",
      "My colleague Colin Paterson has been speaking to some of the cast ahead of the big day, including Shane Richie, who's played Alfie Moon on and off for years.",
      "Richie said there was \"an air of anticipation and nerves\" ahead of the live episode.",
      "\"My biggest fear [is] that people will tune in to see something go wrong. And over the years, there's some famous ones, you can go and check them out, where there have been some bloopers,\" he said.",
      "\"It's a big, big story we are dealing with on the live there,\" he added. \"All the cast is involved and we're very excited and nervous.\"",

      "Adding to this month's busy video games release calendar is the cinematic Lost Records: Bloom & Rage Part 1 (PlayStation, Xbox, PC) from Don't Nod, the original makers of the popular Life is Strange series.",
      "The choose-your-own-adventure gameplay sees the studio returning to its roots after forays into other genres proved less commercially successful.",
      "This time, expect nostalgia and a dream-pop soundtrack as players flit between the present day and the sun-kissed Michigan summer of 1995, unravelling the mystery at the heart of the game.",
      "Choice is also at the heart of fantasy role-playing game Avowed, this week's other major game release and the first big title of the year from one of Microsoft's in-house studios.",
      "Director Carrie Patel, of Fallout New Vegas and Outer Worlds developer Obsidian, recently told BBC Newsbeat the game was designed to accommodate players who want a quicker play-through as well as those who like to spend hours exploring.",

      "Tweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.",
      "The Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.",
      "In a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"",
      "Speaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that.",
      "\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made.",
      "\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"",
      "The original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.",
      "After they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context.",
      "Asked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.",
      "\"A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.\"",
      "She highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: \"I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence?",
      "\"It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like.\"",
      "Bajaria added that, despite the tweets, Netflix did not regret its decision to pick up the film.",
      "\"If you ask me today, everything I know, we would still buy the movie today,\" she said. \"That movie is incredible and it's creative and it's bold - that's what you want, and it resonated with a lot of people this year.\"",
      "Gasc\u00f3n pulled out of appearing at several awards season events after the tweets came to light, and is not scheduled to appear at the Baftas on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.",
      "In an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".",
      "She added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".",
      "Her statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.",
      "Netflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.",
      "Changing the promotional posters",
      "At this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.",
      "The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.",
      "But the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.",
      "Previously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.",
      "But an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.",
      "\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.",
      "The CNN interview",
      "Gasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.",
      "But she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
      "It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".",
      "The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.",
      "Often, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.",
      "Pulling out of events",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.",
      "These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "However, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.",
      "And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.",
      "The publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".",
      "It remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.",
      "What happens to the 'Fab Five' Oscars format?",
      "Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies.",
      "This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.",
      "For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.",
      "Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.",
      "However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.",
      "Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy.",
      "Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.",
      "How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-stars",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.",
      "It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.",
      "\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"",
      "Later, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".",
      "Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.",
      "Meanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".",
      "\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.",
      "\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"",
      "After his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"",

      "\"They're harder to play than a theatre or comedy club because the laughter goes up, it doesn't come towards the stage,\" says Dean, who has played support slots in arenas.",
      "He says it's difficult for comedians in Kay's situation to hear what audience members are actually saying, and that their interjections are also distracting for others watching in different parts of the arena.",
      "\"People say, 'he should have said this...', but usually people who say that have never been on stage before and they don't know how hard it can be thinking that quickly in the moment about what the best thing for the show is; because you just want everybody to have a good time.\"",
      "Another British comic James Acaster last year released a special entitled Hecklers Welcome, not because he particularly enjoys the experience, but to face his biggest fear and, as he told GQ, \"run towards the thing I was scared of\".",

      "Abi Clarke, who has almost a million followers on TikTok, thinks most comedians will be on Kay's side of the argument.",
      "Crucially though, the Bristolian notes: \"There's a difference betwen heckling and crowd work.",
      "\"With crowd work a comedian is inviting it, you're asking a question, you're wanting a chat and that's very different from somebody shouting out a random thing.",
      "\"Once is fine, or twice but if the comedian stops engaging with you or says that's enough, then at that point you're ruining it.\"",
      "New comic superstar Paul Smith made his name roasting crowds as an MC/compere in Liverpool, while Jimmy Carr is also famed for inviting and actively engaging with interruptions.",
      "For Clarke, heckling comes into its own when comics are workshopping new material. If someone joins in, it can create new \"source material\" that can be used as a fresh joke at the next gig.",
      "\"I've had hecklers who have interrupted multiple times but if they're engaging, joining in with what you're saying and being positive, I don't mind that, it's quite fun.",
      "\"If they're just derailing the gig because they like the sound of their own voice, then I think you should just chuck them out!",
      "\"'Garlic bread' - there's not much you can do with that.\"",
      "'Spontaneous moments'",
      "Clarke thinks if you're going to someone's headline show that they've honed and crafted - \"they've perfected the rhythm, set-up and punchline\" - then the time to interject has passed.",
      "\"I promise you, It will be a better show if they get to perform it how it's meant to be performed.\"",
      "The other time that heckling comes in handy, she says, is for promotional purposes online, as comics don't want to give away their best written material for free, when a great bit of crowd banter will show off their skills just as well.",
      "\"The ones we will post are the wonderful one-off spontaneous moments because they'll never happen again, so they won't ruin the show.\"",
      "She's \"quite lucky so far\", she says, having had only \"two or three horrible instances\" of bad heckling, and in those cases the audience had her back.",
      "\"It's easy to win an argument against a person that no one in the room likes.\"",
      "Her new tour, Role Model, which kicks off on Thursday 17 April in Southampton, finds her keeping a humorous tally of bad behaviour, while questioning if she herself is a bad person for doing certain things.",
      "During these moments she finds other girls will supportively offer, \"no, it's fine\", which she really appreciates on a human level, but \"that's not what the joke is for!\".",
      "'Chaos and magic'",
      "Welsh comic Paul Hilleard, who won the BBC New Comedy Award last year, believes dealing with hecklers is \"part of the job\" and that Kay - a finalist in the same award in 1997 - may have \"thrown his toys out of the pram\" a bit, especially given he was playing to a room of \"people who love you\", he says.",
      "It's a bit different from some of the venues - or \"bear pits\" - that he plays as an up-and-coming comedian in Bristol, while also working as a teaching assistant.",
      "He sometimes performs in back rooms of pubs, where people don't always know that comedy is about to take place around them.",
      "\"Heckling is just part of the game, it's not fun... but it can be,\" he adds, mischievously.",
      "\"I've always been taught you've got to play the room. If it's chaotic, it doesn't matter if you've written the best 20 minutes ever, you've got to control that room of people who are intoxicated, and show them that you're funnier.\"",
      "Stag and hen dos, which tend to gravitate to comedy nights, can bring such chaos.",
      "Hilleard says he has spoken with other comics who agree that audiences \"are a little more feral\" since returning from the Covid lockdown, \"heightened\" by social media.",
      "\"One guy was on magic mushrooms, we found out, and it became part of the show, you lean into it,\" he says. \"That's the best thing you can do, until they become very abusive.\"",
      "\"There's a line,\" he continues. \"If you're ruining the show, that becomes the venue's problem.",
      "\"But it's our job as a comic to make that heckle part of the show, as that's where the magic is.\"",
      "He will perform at the Machynlleth Comedy Festival in May, and said there are \"tricks of the trade\" including certian \"jokes and comebacks\" that experienced comedians can lean on to deal with such situations.",
      "But it's all worth it, he says, \"if you can turn something on the fly that wasn't planned into something hilarous\".",
      "\"That's when people are like, 'oh my God, how did you do do that?'.\"",
      "Nine out of 10 hecklers, he believes, are not trying to ruin the show, they just think it's \"part of the fun\" or \"want to be acknowledged\".",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:01:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Archive documents show Manchester and Birmingham were considered as alternative settings for the soap.",
    "story": [
      "For 40 years, EastEnders has shown us life in a fictional community in east London - but from the iconic characters to the theme tune, could it all have been very different?",
      "In the early research stages of EastEnders, multiple cities were considered for the new soap, from Manchester to London to Birmingham, according to BBC archive documents.",
      "But one audience report recommended that a serial set in a working-class neighbourhood in London would probably have the most widespread appeal.",
      "This would also set the soap apart from other big series of the time, like Coronation Street (set in Greater Manchester), Emmerdale Farm (set in Yorkshire) and Crossroads (set in a Midlands motel).",
      "Though EastEnders creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland would eventually settle on the fictional Walford with its E20 postcode, at this point the show had a working title of East 8 - and it was to be based on a real street in the London borough of Hackney.",
      "In March 1984, Smith and Holland headed to Lanzarote for a working holiday where they created 23 character biographies, three years of storyline overviews and 20 detailed story breakdowns.",
      "Despite all their planning, however, some of the most important elements of EastEnders were last-minute accidents, including the iconic drum \"doof doofs\" in the theme tune, which have since become shorthand for the show's dramatic cliffhangers.",
      "\"In those days, if a theme tune was popular, you'd often release it as a single. So I would make longer versions of the themes to allow for that,\" says Simon May, the theme tune's composer, who would go on to write EastEnders-related singles for cast members Anita Dobson and Nick Berry.",
      "\"The longer version gets a bit more Cockney, so I asked the drummer to play something to transition into the end theme. He played those 'doof doofs' and Tony and Julia happened to be in the studio at the time.",
      "\"They said: 'We love that drum thing.'\"",
      "Another key ingredient of the early years of EastEnders also happened at the last minute: the pairing of the actors behind Angie and her bad-boy husband Den Watts, played by Leslie Grantham.",
      "After a read-through of the first six episodes, the producers thought that original Angie Watts actress Jean Fennell was not quite working in the role. Anita Dobson took on the character at the last minute.",
      "Actor and stuntman Derek Martin, who joined the soap 15 years later as Charlie Slater, explains he was also up for the role of Den.",
      "\"Leslie got it, and he was very good, he was the ladies' man, and I was more the hard man,\" the 91-year-old actor says.",
      "This pairing of Angie and Den proved popular with the public - and the Christmas Day 1986 episode that sees Den serve Angie divorce papers remains the only scripted programme to have been watched by more than 30 million people in the UK, according to Barb figures.",
      "'We might have something here'",
      "The first episode of EastEnders was broadcast on 19 February 1985, with 17 million people watching - making it the second most-watched episode on the BBC that week behind The Two Ronnies.",
      "This compared with the 18 million who watched the same week's Coronation Street.",
      "The episode started with a kick, as Den broke down a door to find the nearly dead body of Reg Cox (played by Johnnie Clayton) - and ended with a punch, as suspect number one in the attack, Nick Cotton (John Altman), put his fist through the glass of the Queen Vic doors.",
      "Though the press was quick to set up a rivalry between EastEnders and Coronation Street, the cast had their eye on another ITV soap.",
      "Actor Adam Woodyat, who played Ian Beale in that first episode, says: \"We were going out at the same time as Emmerdale Farm at 7pm. It felt like Emmerdale Farm gave us an absolute kicking in the ratings until they shifted us to half past seven.\"",
      "Newspapers of the time suggested reactions were mixed. A Sunday People poll of 600 viewers showed 56% of respondents didn't like the first episode, with complaints over \"coarse\" and \"bawdy\" dialogue.",
      "The Guardian, however, was more measured, with their critic Hugh Hebert predicting it would \"probably take a year before anyone knows whether the BBC has got it right\".",
      "The show would prove itself earlier than that. On 25 July 1985, the programme was the most-watched on the BBC that week. This coincided with the show's first blockbuster storyline that saw Michelle (played by Susan Tully) become pregnant by a mystery man, eventually revealed to be Den Watts.",

      "Mr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years.

      "The loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.",
      "Before the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.",
      "\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"",

      "Many say these efforts are not enough and that Hollywood's biggest companies need to commit to filming in LA.",
      "But studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line. The reality is LA is expensive and the vast majority of industry jobs here are union protected \u2013 so they come with high salaries and expensive health care and pensions.",

They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.",
      "\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.",
      "Before the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.",

The Canadian dollar recently hit 22-year lows making Canada even more attractive to Hollywood.",
      "On a rainy day more than a month after the fires, Mr Worthington, the production designer, and his partner Mindy Elliott, a film editor, inspected the remains of their home, wishing they'd taken some of their art when they evacuated.

      "Pop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",
      "Rocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna has sat out of view of cameras in the courtroom.",

      "Growing up in Lisburn, County Antrim, Emerson told BBC News NI that the talks which brought about the Good Friday Agreement gave him an appetite for this depiction of the election of a new pope, and the skills to put it together.",

      "It's not the first time a papal conclave has been depicted on screen, and though the real world process is shrouded in mystery, there has been a number of notable attempts to dramatise what goes on.",
      "'Crisis of faith'",
      "Emerson told BBC News that he and Edward Berger - the acclaimed German-Austrian film-maker whose 2022 adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front was nominated for nine Academy Awards - aspired to make something that would replicate the 70s thrillers they grew up on.",
      "\"Edward and I are big fans of films like All The President's Men and we both thought: 'Wouldn't it be great to aspire to something like that?'",

      "What's the Chitlin' Circuit?",
      "From the late 1880s until the 1960s, so-called Jim Crow laws enforced segregation against black Americans and saw them treated as second-class citizens.",
      "It meant that they were separated from white people - often prevented from living in certain neighbourhoods, forced to attend different schools and banned from public spaces.",
      "During this era, black musicians and performers created their own network of live performance venues across the United States.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 06:38:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Spending on the NHS has been going up for decades and is set to rise further. BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
    "story": [
      "The amount of money the UK spends on health, predominantly on the NHS, has been rising for decades.",
      "And as the UK population ages and people demand access to new medicines and treatments, there is every likelihood that the national bill will continue to grow.",
      "So how much could the NHS ultimately end up costing the nation? And is it possible to get better value for the money we collectively spend?",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
      "How much do we spend on health?",
      "Shortly after the NHS was founded, in 1949-50, total UK health spending was around \u00a317bn in today's money.",
      "By 2023\u201324 it had grown to \u00a3226bn.",
      "Health spending per person in 2022-23 was around \u00a33,300 in England and Scotland, \u00a33,600 in Wales and \u00a33,500 in Northern Ireland.",
      "In the Autumn Budget last year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced an additional \u00a326bn a year for the English health budget by 2025-26, which will automatically increase the resources available to the devolved nations.",
      "As a share of the overall economy - or GDP - spending on health has massively increased over the past 70 years.",
      "In 1949-50, health spending was only 3.6% of GDP. In 2023-24, it had more than doubled to 8.1% of GDP, after peaking at more than 10% in the Covid pandemic.",
      "Health spending jumped in the pandemic due to the costs of vaccinations and the \"test and trace\" programme.",
      "Around 80% of total health spending is funded by the government in the UK, mainly going to the NHS. The other 20% comes through private insurance schemes or out-of-pocket costs.",
      "That means health spending as a share of total government spending has also considerably increased.",
      "In the middle of the 1950s, health accounted for around \u00a31 in every \u00a38 the government spent.",
      "Today it's roughly \u00a31 in every \u00a33.",
      "How does that compare to other countries?",
      "Despite that surge in health spending in recent decades, the UK is by no means an outlier among rich countries.",
      "In 2022, using comparable data on public health spending, the UK was spending around 9.3% of GDP.",
      "That was higher than Canada (7.9%) and Italy (6.8%) as well as the EU average, but less than Germany (10.9%) and France (10.2%).",
      "The US was the real outlier, spending 14.1% of GDP on health, largely because America has a private insurance system with few of the cost controls of other nations.",
      "And those countries have, like the UK, seen health spending rise considerably in recent decades, driven up by growing demand for new medical treatments and ageing populations.",
      "What's going to happen to NHS spending in future?",
      "Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's official forecaster, said there was every likelihood there would be continued upward pressure on UK public health spending, citing those same factors: an ageing population and more demand for new medicines and treatments.",
      "It also cites rising ill health among the population as one of the contributors to rising spending, albeit not the dominant one.",
      "The amount of health spending on an individual rises dramatically as they grow older. Average annual spending per person on those aged 45 is around \u00a32,000. For those aged 85 it is \u00a313,000 a year.",
      "The OBR projects that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over will rise from around one in five today to one in four by 2070.",
      "As people's incomes grow, research suggests they are typically willing to spend more of those incomes on healthcare, which in the UK is done mainly through the taxpayer-funded NHS.",
      "In its central forecast, the OBR projected UK public healthcare spending will rise by around 3% every year, after adjusting for inflation. This would be broadly in line with average growth over recent decades, although the rate has fluctuated under different governments.",
      "The OBR estimates this trend would add up to roughly an extra 1% of GDP going on public health spending every decade going forward.",
      "That would take public health spending from around 8% of GDP in 2024-25, up to 14.5% of GDP by 2073-74, equivalent to around \u00a3180bn in today's money.",
      "However, this would also depend on the long term growth rate of the economy. The OBR assumes public health spending will grow roughly twice as fast as the overall economy.",
      "If that path of spending transpired, it would also likely mean health spending accounting for an even larger share of total government public service spending.",
      "How do we get better value for money from health spending?",
      "Many politicians argue it's important for the NHS to deliver higher levels of productivity, in other words, to spend money more efficiently in order to keep the national bill under control.",
      "Productivity growth in the NHS has long lagged behind productivity growth in the rest of the UK economy.",
      "Last year, the OBR looked at what would happen if NHS productivity grew faster than currently expected in the coming decades.",
      "This, the OBR said, could curb the overall rise in public health spending. It might rise only to 11% of GDP by 2074, rather than to 14.5%.",
      "The recent indications of productivity growth in the NHS, however, are unclear.",
      "The latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics are that in the second half of 2024 NHS measured \"inputs\" - mainly in the form of more doctors and nurses hired - were 32% higher than they were before the pandemic in 2019.",
      "But measured \"outputs\" - things like operations completed and patients discharged - were only up by 7%.",
      "This meant that UK public sector health productivity was still around 19% lower than it was five years previously - and showing no signs of sustained growth.",
      "However, measuring productivity in the public services is far from simple and the ONS has stressed that these statistics are still only \"in development\".",
      "Other estimates from NHS England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies - the independent economic research institute - point to an improvement in productivity in hospitals in England more recently, suggesting a corner might have been turned in the delivery of health services after the shock of the pandemic.",
      "But regardless of the statistical discrepancy, most experts agree that improving productivity in the health sector in the medium and long term is an important objective. And the extent to which it is delivered will play a key part in determining how much the NHS ends up costing the nation in the coming years.",

      "There can be \"no durable peace\" in Ukraine without European nations, particularly Ukraine, taking part in talks to end the war with Russia, the UK business secretary has told the BBC.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds downplayed divisions between the US and its allies over resolving the conflict, following concerns over the Trump administration moving ahead with peace talks that would lock out European countries, including Ukraine.",
      "In response, European leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer, will meet in Paris on Monday, while US officials prepare to meet Russian negotiators separately.",
      "Reynolds told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the UK could act as a \"bridge\" between the US and Europe.",
      "Reynolds also told the programme, hosted by Victoria Derbyshire, that the UK and Europe had to respond to US demands for them to pay more towards their \"collective defence\" in the face of \"greater threats\".",
      "He said the UK government would set out a roadmap to increase defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national output, but declined to offer a definitive timetable.",
      "The Trump administration has called on Nato allies to raise defence spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP), and has said in the past week that it will no longer primarily be focused on European security.",
      "Pressed on whether the 2.5% figure would be sufficient, Reynolds said any decision on further increases would take threats to national security into account.",
      "Asked if the threat had \"just got bigger without the US\", he said there was \"no doubt\" it had.",
      "Former head of the Army Lord Dannatt has joined calls for Labour to go beyond its target of 2.5%, warning on Saturday the UK military was \"too run down\" to lead any future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine.",
      "However, Ministry of Defence sources told the BBC the priority was setting a date for when 2.5% would be reached, adding that would be the first time the UK had spent that much on defence since the last Labour government.",
      "Reynolds said he thought the UK could \"play a constructive role\" as a bridge  between the US and Europe \"as we adjust to this new era - and it certainly is a new era\".",
      "But he added that there had not been a \"fundamental breach\" in relations and there was \"still a great deal of common ground\".",
      "The business secretary did concede it would not \"be easy [as] there's a very assertive agenda from the US\".",
      "Asked what he made of the UK and European nations not being invited to the US-Russian talks, Reynolds said US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had made clear that \"everything is still on the table\".",
      "\"We shouldn't rule out potential outcomes,\" he added.",

      "Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK and US have a \"mutual interest\" in negotiating an exemption from President Donald Trump's plans for the 25% import tax, which could come into force in March.",
      "He said the UK was in a different trading position to other countries and could offer \"very specialised\" steel and aluminium exports the US needs like Navy submarine casings made in Sheffield, while tariffs would push up costs for US taxpayers.",
      "Reynolds' comments came after the government promised up to \u00a32.5bn in support for the UK steel industry.",

      "He added: \"I appreciate they have a mandate for changing how they approach the issues of trade, but we have got a different argument, a different story to tell, to the EU or to China in relation to our trading relationships.\"",
      "The government has already said it would not retaliate immediately to the tariffs announced by Trump.",
      "UK Steel, which represents the industry, has said the tariffs would be a \"devastating blow\" that would damage the sector's \u00a3400m-a-year contribution to UK-US trade.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports.",
      "But there are concerns within the industry the tariffs might not just hinder exports to the US, but also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This could occur if other countries no longer exporting to the US decide to offload steel at cheaper prices, which could potentially lead to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the \"uncertainty\" the steel industry faced due to US tariffs was something the government \"has been entirely silent on when instead they should be talking to the US, our closest trading partner\".",

      "Griffiths said he looked forward to seeing a detailed plan, but added \"a clear part must be steps to reduce the cost of energy which is placing an intolerable strain on UK steel\".",
      "Help for the sector will be available through the National Wealth Fund, which partners the government with the private sector and local authorities to finance infrastructure and other projects.",
      "The government says this financial assistance could benefit Scotland, as well as areas of England such as Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, Rotherham and Redcar which have \"a strong history of steel production\".",

      "The GMB union said the government's plan to support the \"beleaguered\" steel industry provided \"desperately needed\" funding after \"years of dithering\".",
      "\"As the world becomes more volatile, primary domestic steel making capacity is vital for both our economy and domestic security,\" the union's national secretary Andy Prendergast added.",

      "Information gathered in the consultation will be used to help form a \"steel strategy\", to be launched in the spring.",
      "Stace added a robust strategy \"has the power to reverse the sector's decline, particularly as we face increasing competition from imports benefiting from more favourable business conditions\".",
      "The Liberal Democrats have said the government urgently needs to prepare for retaliatory tariff. Deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the UK steel industry was being left \"dangerously exposed\" to the \"devastating damage\" Trump's tariffs could inflict."

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:45:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Senior figures defended the chancellor after we revealed her expenses were investigated before she was an MP.",
    "story": [
      "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".",
      "But Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.",
      "Here we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.",
      "What did we reveal about Reeves's expenses?",
      "The BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.",
      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos.",
      "It accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",
      "We have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.",
      "The chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP",
      "The chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP",
      "What happened to the whistleblower's complaint?",
      "The complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department.",
      "This was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.",
      "What we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion.",
      "How are Labour defending Reeves?",
      "Reeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms.",
      "She said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.",
      "Other Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks.",
      "On Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\".",
      "Both he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.",
      "What did the HR manager say?",
      "Wayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team.",
      "She provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".",
      "However, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.",
      "Kyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.",
      "He also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank.",
      "In reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.",
      "What has Reeves said?",
      "On Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"",
      "She said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.",
      "Her expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "What has BBC News established about her LinkedIn CV?",
      "Reeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.",
      "We established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "Reeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.",
      "However, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).",
      "The BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",
      "Who is Rachel Reeves?",
      "Rachel Reeves can be trusted, says minister"

      "Sir Keir and Zelensky spoke on the phone ahead of a global leaders' meeting at the Munich Security Conference.",

      "Trump's defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has said restoring Ukraine's territory to where it was before the first Russian invasion in 2014 is simply \"not realistic\".",
      "Speaking at a defence summit in Brussels on Wednesday, Hegseth also downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato.",

      "Earlier in the day, Vance had said he hoped his discussion with Lammy would focus on what they \"spoke about a couple of years ago when we met, which is our shared belief that Europe really should take a bigger role in its own security\".",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:42:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate tariffs prompts questions over the possible impact on British businesses.",
    "story": [
      "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.",
      "Trump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.",
      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",
      "The use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.",
      "Trump launches plan to target countries with new tariffs",
      "UK not planning to hit back at US on steel tariffs",
      "UK signals it will seek US steel tariff exemption",
      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",
      "Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.",
      "But she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".",
      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",
      "Mr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".",
      "Senior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.",
      "\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\""

      "They urge her to give the UK an ultimatum: \"Back down from this dangerous attack on US cybersecurity, or face serious consequences.\"",
      "The BBC has contacted the UK government for comment.",
      "\"While the UK has been a trusted ally, the US government must not permit what is effectively a foreign cyberattack waged through political means\", the US politicians wrote.",
      "If the UK does not back down Ms Gabbard should \"reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as US intelligence sharing\", they suggest.",
      "What is the UK seeking?",
      "The request for the data emerged last week.",
      "It applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP).",
      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",
      "They state that Apple does not make different versions of its encryption software for each country it operates in and, therefore, Apple customers in the UK will use the same software as Americans.",
      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

    "story": [
      "Work on a number of new towns will begin before the next general election after more than 100 locations across England were put forward, Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook has pledged.",
      "The government says most proposals are to extend existing towns or cities, alongside a \"smaller number\" of new standalone settlements.",
      "The aim is for each new town to have at least 10,000 homes, contributing towards Labour's 1.5 million five-year housebuilding target.",
      "Each should include infrastructure like public transport and schools, alongside affordable housing, ministers say.",
      "A visit to Milton Keynes by the PM to promote the policy was cut short earlier when farmers driving tractors staged a noisy protest.",
      "Ministers desperately want more housing - but are their plans radical enough?",
      "What's the new government's housebuilding target?",
      "Labour to select new town sites by end of first year",
      "The tractors' musical horns could be heard blaring across the building site shortly after Sir Keir Starmer arrived.",
      "It is the latest in a series of protests mounted by farmers against changes to inheritance tax on farms announced at October's Budget.",
      "Creating a new generation of new towns is a key element of the government's long-term plan for housebuilding, and part of its efforts to unlock economic growth.",
      "More than 100 potential sites across England have been suggested to a special taskforce set up to examine the options, after the government asked for expressions of interest from councils, housing developers and landowners.",
      "The sites have not been revealed, but London, the South East, the South West and the east of England have proved the most popular \u2013 though there were expressions of interest from every region.",
      "The taskforce will identify specific locations - as well as funding options - by the summer, with a view to construction on the first sites beginning by the time of the next election.",
      "Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the aim was to build \"well-designed, affordable, attractive homes\" that would \"eventually house millions of people, just as the post-War waves of new towns did\".",
      "He described it as a \"transformational programme\" that he expected to \"make a contribution to housing numbers in this parliament\".",
      "However, speaking on Sky News, he conceded: \"These things take time to get off the ground. No one's pretending that the new towns programme is going to make up the bulk of that 1.5 million number.",
      "\"We're relying on the other changes we've made, including overhauling the national planning policy framework to get new sites coming through.\"",
      "He said he expected some of the construction to take place on greenfield - or undeveloped - land, but there would also be \"big expansions of existing towns and cities where that is appropriate\".",
      "\"There's got to be sustainable places, as I say, they've got to be well-connected, well-designed.\"",
      "The plan envisages an initial injection of government funding to buy land, which would be returned when sites were sold for a higher price to private developers, and would help pay for local infrastructure.",

      "Spending review",
      "When the policy was originally unveiled at the party's conference in 2023, Labour set out a plan to use state-backed companies to construct a wave of new towns near English cities, echoing those built by Labour after World War Two.",
      "However, it is not clear how much public money will be allocated to the initiative.",
      "Pennycook told Today this would be decided in the government's spending review which will conclude in June and set spending plans for the next three years.",
      "The review, which is being conducted in a period of minimal economic growth against the backdrop of Labour's self-imposed fiscal constraints, will see ministers haggle for money for their departments.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told departments to identify 5% \"efficiency savings\" as part of the process, to ensure key services are prioritised for funding.",
      "Polly Neate, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Shelter, urged the government to provide \"serious investment\" in affordable social housing \"to drive up building to the scale the country desperately needs\".",
      "\"New towns are a huge opportunity for the government to tackle housing need and provide local communities with homes they can actually afford to live in. The government must commit serious investment at the Spending Review in June to drive up building to the scale the country desperately needs.\"",
      "Clement Attlee's 1945-51 government planned the first wave of new towns to relocate people from poor or bombed-out housing, with development corporations assigned responsibility for building them.",
      "Stevenage in Hertfordshire was the first such town created, with 10 others following by 1955, including Crawley in Sussex, Harlow in Essex, and Newton Aycliffe in County Durham.",

    "summary": "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, official figures suggest.",
    "story": [
      "The UK economy unexpectedly grew in the final three months of last year following a boost to the construction and services sectors.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, according to official figures, despite analysts predicting it would contract.",
      "Growth in the quarter was driven by a range of industries, from pubs and bars to machinery manufacturers, having a strong December.",
      "However, the figures also indicated living standards last year were slightly lower than in 2023 on average.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "The Bank of England has also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year, amid concerns that higher costs for employers could hit hiring, profits, investment - and push up prices. Last week, it decided to cut interest rates to 4.5%.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was \"all-but stagnating\" as businesses adjusted for higher costs and \"more uncertainty overseas\" - pointing to the introduction of trade tariffs in the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "He said it was a clear that \"a lot of the weakness\" in the economy was due to the rise in taxes on firms announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her Budget last year, with \"business sentiment on the floor\" and investment and consumer spending down.",
      "\"Overall, the economy is unlikely to do more than move sideways over the next six months,\" he suggested.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "But the latest figures showing a return to growth at the end of 2024 will be welcome news for the government, which has made growing the economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "A separate figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measuring living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared with the year before. The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.",
      "When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "All this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.",
      "In December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.",
      "Film distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.",
      "However, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.",
      "In the construction sector, the final months of 2024 saw an increase in new work driven by new private housing projects, but repairs and maintenance work from private homes fell over the period, suggesting homeowners cut back.",
      "'People don't have the money'",
      "Sushma Solanki, the owner of Bolton catering firm Sushma's Snacks, told the BBC the economic situation was \"very worrying\" as she found trading at the end of last year very tough.",
      "\"I normally do about 20 to 30 Christmas office events,\" she said. \"Instead, I did two, which was very hard. People don't have the money.\"",
      "She said she had to let go an employee partly because of the upcoming rise in National Insurance.",
      "\"It's not just the policies, it's everything. Peppers for my chicken dish started off at 79p, they are \u00a31.85,\" she added.",
      "Chris Taylor, the owner of coffee shop Gran T's in Manchester, said he was \"shocked\" that there had been any growth in the economy.",
      "\"Going into last winter was one of the biggest struggles. I think a lot of people were naturally clinging onto their purse strings. Trade was not there,\" he said.",
      "\"This government's action plan, without hitting people directly with higher taxes, is hitting the level above and that effectively is going to hit people one way or another. It is really an indirect punch to the whole economy.\"",
      "Following the release of the new figures, the chancellor said she was still not satisfied with the performance of the economy.",
      "\"It's not possible to turn around more than a decade of poor economic performance in just a few months, but we are doing what is necessary to bring stability to the economy,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also said the government was going \"further and faster\" to \"put more money in people's pockets\".",
      "She also reiterated her self-imposed rules on borrowing and debt were \"non-negotiable\" after reports this week suggested the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had downgraded growth forecasts.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget was \"killing growth\" in the UK.",
      "\"Working people and businesses are already paying for her choices with ever rocketing taxes, hundreds of thousands of job cuts and business confidence plummeting,\" he added.",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said the chancellor's Budget was to blame for \"pitiful economic growth\".",

      "Last week David Thomas said on social media that he had \"officially\" opened a new Lidl in Cwmbran, posing alongside store workers, and two other Reform councillors.",
      "But the discount supermarket said no official ribbon cutting took place and no formal invitations had been issued. Thomas' post was later deleted.",

      "She added: \"We cannot be in a situation where we allow enormous numbers of people to exploit our laws in this way.\"",
      "In response, Sir Keir said: \"It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration.",

      "\"It was a one nation experiment in open borders, and she was the cheerleader, she was the one campaigning for more people to come,\" he added.",
      "The family had applied unsuccessfully to come to the UK under the Ukraine Family Scheme, which closed last February.",
      "However, the upper tribunal judge in their appeal case concluded there were \"very compelling or exceptional circumstances\" meaning they should be allowed the right to live in the UK.",
      "In his judgement, he said the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains \"exceptionally dangerous\" and \"dire\".",
      "He added that the youngest children - now aged seven and nine - are \"at a high risk of death or serious injury on a daily basis\" and that it is \"overwhelmingly\" in their best interests to be in a safe or safer environment together with their parents and siblings.",

      "Gillett also made another claim about Reeves's time at the bank from 2006 to 2009, writing that she: \"Nearly got sacked due to an expenses scandal where the 3 senior managers were all signing off each others expenses.\"",
      "Reeves's team vigorously denied the allegations.",
      "However, Labour's imminent victory in last summer's general election prompted a post on a private Facebook group for former HBOS employees that BBC News has seen asking if anyone remembered Reeves.",
      "One former employee replied: \"the expenses dept certainly do!\"",
      "Several others made reference to Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending.",
      "BBC News has been seeking the truth behind these suggestions, speaking to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues, and gaining access to receipts, emails and other documents.",
      "We have learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Reeves and two other senior managers.",
      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint and dozens of pages of attached evidence, which we have seen, raised concerns that the three managers were using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\" with allegedly inappropriate spending on dinners, events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed it may not have concluded.",
      "But the initial part of the investigation, which was conducted by Internal Audit at the request of the bank's risk department, found that the three managers appeared to have broken the rules and the whistleblower's allegations were substantiated, according to a senior source with knowledge of the investigation.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Banking career",
      "Reeves was in her 20s and trying to become an MP when she took up a job at Halifax Bank of Scotland in West Yorkshire in 2006.",
      "The role required her to move north from London, where she had unsuccessfully stood as Labour's parliamentary candidate in what had been a safe Conservative seat.",
      "She initially worked in the mortgage department, but in late 2007 moved to become Head of Business Planning in the Customer Relations department, which handled complaints.",
      "Her career at HBOS coincided with what would prove to be a tumultuous time for the bank.",
      "The global financial crisis which began in late summer of 2007 would force the sector to embark on a massive programme of job cuts and cost savings.",
      "In September 2008, HBOS itself came close to collapse, requiring a government-brokered takeover by Lloyds and an emergency bailout which would total \u00a320.5bn of taxpayers' money.",
      "It was shortly after this near-collapse, by early 2009, that a whistleblower from her department raised concerns about the spending habits of Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was Reeves's boss.",

      "Written by a planning and strategy manager, the document, \"Financial Risk Control within Customer Relations\", raised concerns about \"spending on travel\" and on corporate spending cards, including Motivation cards which were used to reward staff.",
      "It laid out proposals to \"improve cost controls\" which included monthly discussions with Reeves and another of the senior managers who the whistleblower claimed had mis-used expenses to \"give visibility of claims, invoices, Thanks card use and reports\".",
      "Separately, Reeves was emailed in mid-December 2008 about proposals for a presentation setting out how much had been spent on Motivation cards, recognising top performers and on taxi travel, to \"focus attention on particular aspects of travel that are costly and perhaps need more consideration\".",
      "Reeves replied to say that she was not sure a \"huge analysis\" was needed and she wanted to see the papers before they went any further.",
      "Whistleblower complaint and investigation",
      "The whistleblower's complaint submitted by early 2009 was a six-page document laying out a range of concerns about an alleged spending culture in the Customer Relations department.",
      "It focused on the behaviour of three individuals: Reeves, Reeves's boss, and another senior manager in the department. Reeves's boss, who we are not naming, was responsible for signing off the expenses of the other two managers.",
      "The report and attached receipts and other documents seen by BBC News show Reeves was accused of spending hundreds of pounds on handbags, perfume, earrings and wine for colleagues, including one gift for her boss. Concern was also expressed about her spending on taxis and on a Christmas party. The whistleblower believed the spending to be excessive.",
      "After a call to the whistleblowing hotline, the whistleblower was instructed to hand in a physical copy of their report and supporting evidence, two sources said.",
      "A separate source, who contacted BBC News themselves in the wake of an article on the furore around Reeves's CV last year, was also aware that someone had blown the whistle on Reeves and another colleague.",
      "The report was passed to the bank's risk department and, at their request, was taken on by the Internal Audit department.",
      "A source who worked in risk at the bank told us: \"Given the nature of the allegations \u2013 claiming expenses for things you wouldn't normally claim expenses for \u2013 and the relative seniority of the individuals, the matter was referred for investigation by a team outside of that department.\"",
      "The Internal Audit department, which had access to expenses claims and sign-offs, then assessed the complaint and supporting documents, according to two sources.",
      "It found that there was evidence of apparent wrongdoing by the three senior managers including Reeves, a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation told BBC News.",
      "Internal Audit completed its involvement in the investigation and passed its findings to an investigative part of the Risk department in around April 2009. The normal process would then have been for the managers to be interviewed about the allegations. There would then be an assessment of potential disciplinary action if necessary.",
      "However it does not appear that this next interview stage took place, or that the investigation ever reached a formal conclusion. Reeves insisted she was never interviewed, as did her boss, who said she was \"not aware of an expenses probe and my departure was not related to any alleged investigation\". The other senior manager declined to comment.",
      "There is no evidence of which we are aware that the bank's internal investigation was completed, or that there was ever a concluding finding of any wrongdoing.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "They also provided a statement from the lawyer who provided legal advice on the compromise agreement - a voluntary legal document ending an employee's employment - she signed on her departure.",
      "He said it was a \"standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\".",
      "\"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process,\" he said.",
      "Expenses allegations",
      "What lay behind the whistleblower's complaint and the grumbles of other colleagues was unhappiness relating to several different areas of spending.",
      "One concern was the use of bank payment cards to pay for Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "\"A culture developed among senior managers in Customer Relations where gifts were given freely to direct reports  - both upwards and downwards,\" one former colleague of Reeves claimed.",
      "\"[They had] a very cavalier attitude regarding the budget in the department.\"",
      "Reeves and the other senior managers had both a corporate credit card and another payment card known as a 'Motivation' or 'Thanks' card.",
      "The Motivation card was intended to be used to reward high-performers for good work.",
      "There was guidance about its use. In February 2008 a memo instructed HBOS employees on the correct use of Motivation cards, which were widely used within the Customer Relations department.",
      "It stated that the cards were to be used to \"reward/acknowledge colleagues who have gone the extra mile\".",
      "Suggested gifts included \"chocolates, flowers, wine, vouchers or you could simply log on and send a free e-card to say 'Thanks' for a job well done\", the memo said.",
      "It warned that managers would be \"responsible for all transactions on your card and will be held accountable if spending on your statement cannot be verified\".",
      "Spending in this area was scrutinised because the company incurred tax on it.",
      "The memo doesn't explicitly prohibit Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "But 11 former employees told us they had never heard of colleagues being bought birthday gifts with the bank's money, and believed that doing so was in breach of the rules. Several said any birthday gifts were bought with their own money.",
      "However, one ex-staff member, Jane Wayper, a former HR business partner who was given permission to speak to us by Reeves's team, claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\" and \"staff were encouraged to do so for their teams\".",
      "Reeves bought birthday presents for colleagues with HBOS's money throughout her time in Customer Relations, receipts show, with purchases including wine and cosmetics. Some were bought using a Motivation card, while others were reimbursed through an expenses claim.",
      "She also spent \u00a3152 on a handbag and perfume as a present for her boss using the bank's money, according to the whistleblower's report. The present was a joint gift from Reeves and one of the other managers who was later investigated alongside her.",
      "And she bought earrings as a present for her PA, which she claimed back on expenses.",
      "Her PA, Linda Barrowclough, said she had received Christmas and birthday gifts from Reeves but had assumed they were \"personal gifts [and] they'd have come out of her own pocket\".",
      "Reeves also used her Motivation card to spend more than \u00a3400 on a leaving meal for a colleague, which the whistleblowing complaint claimed was not a permitted use.",
      "Christmas gifts",
      "The situation around Christmas gifts, which Reeves also bought for her PA and others, was more complicated.",
      "That's because, according to internal bank guidance we have seen, these could be bought on expenses providing they were small gifts of \u00a325 or less and they were not bought using the Motivation card.",
      "The \u00a325 limit was based on tax advice as anything more substantial would attract tax.",
      "It appeared to her colleagues that Reeves had broken these rules.",
      "But there does appear to have been confusion about the policy. We have also seen emails showing that Reeves was encouraged by her boss to buy more expensive Christmas presents, and to pay for them with her Motivation card.",
      "In late October 2008, Reeves's manager wrote that \"after checking with other departments, it looks like the standard practice of buying\u202fChristmas\u202fgifts for direct reports using motivation bank will continue this year\", emails seen by the BBC show.",
      "She suggested spending \u00a350 to \u00a375 per person on the presents.",
      "A reminder titled \"further clarity\" about how to buy Christmas gifts and how much to spend was circulated by another HBOS employee in early December, emails show.",
      "Reeves and the other managers who were later investigated were all among the recipients of this email confirming the rules on Christmas gifts.",
      "While seasonal gifts, such as at Christmas, were allowed, the managers were explicitly told they could not use Motivation cards for these purchases. The cost of these \"trivial\" gifts was also not allowed to exceed \u00a325, in line with\u202fHMRC guidance, the email said.",
      "This is because rewards for performance at work are taxable whereas seasonal gifts such as those given for Christmas, providing they are not too costly, are exempt.",
      "Replying to the email, Reeves wrote that she didn't understand why the \"goal posts are shifting\" and said she had already ordered and paid for her presents using \"Motivation Bank/Thanks, and I do not intend to cancel them,\" claiming this would cost more time and money.",
      "A colleague responsible for finance acknowledged that the message on paying for Christmas gifts hadn't always been clear but said: \"I don't believe that the goalposts are being moved.\"",
      "Receipts show that gifts bought by Reeves at Christmas 2008 included a \u00a349 handbag for her PA, while she herself received \u00a355 worth of wine from her boss.",
      "Open secret?",
      "There was a widespread belief at the bank that there had been an expenses investigation into Reeves and two colleagues.",
      "But Reeves has said that she has no recollection of being investigated or having questions raised over her expenses.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said she was \"proud of the work she did at HBOS\" and was not aware of the claims about her expenses until approached by the BBC.",
      "\"She was not aware of an investigation nor was she interviewed, and she did not face any disciplinary action on this or any other matters. All expenses were submitted and signed off in the proper way,\" she said.",
      "The spokesman also said Reeves left in 2009 \"on good terms and received a severance payment, including her full notice pay and bonus\".",
      "\"HBOS allowed her to keep a company car for six months after she left and she was given a favourable reference.\"",
      "Reeves's team put forward several former HBOS employees for interview who they said corroborated her account that she had not been investigated.",
      "One said she hadn't seen evidence of senior managers misusing expenses and the bank had controls to prevent it but she left in February 2008, more than a year before Reeves departed. She also said that she had never heard of giving birthday and Christmas gifts at HBOS's expense as being part of the bank's policies.",
      "Another, Jane Wayper, the former HR business partner, said in a statement that she didn't recognise the accusations against Reeves and \"would have been aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" as she would have been involved in the disciplinary process.",
      "She said there was \"extensive oversight of all expenses policies\" and claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\". But this is at odds with a document seen by BBC News and the testimony of 11 sources we have spoken to.",
      "Many of Reeves' former HBOS colleagues were worried about the consequences of sharing confidential information with BBC News but believe it is in the public interest for what happened, and their concerns about the now-Chancellor's spending of the bank's money, to be reported.",
      "But, given their concerns about speaking out publicly, we have agreed not to name them.",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir Starmer still thought the Chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "The investigation at HBOS was not the last time Reeves would face scrutiny over her expenses.",
      "In 2015, it emerged that she was among 19 MPs who had had their official credit cards suspended by the parliamentary expenses watchdog after failing to show their spending was valid.",
      "Reeves owed more than \u00a34,000 in spending at the time when her card was blocked. She subsequently cleared her debt.",

      "Her parents separated when she was at primary school, and she and younger sister Ellie, also a Labour MP, were shuttled between separate homes.",
      "During the school holidays, the sisters would spend time with their grandparents in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering.",
      "They would be taken to do the rounds of relatives' houses, who would give them a 20p or 50p piece each. At the end of their week, they were taken to the local toy shop to choose their goodies. While Ellie would spend all her cash, the young Rachel would allow herself a smaller treat and save most of the money.",
      "Decades later, Chancellor Reeves would say that kind of restraint defines her, and she has very much modelled herself on Gordon Brown\u2019s \"prudence\" in the lead-up to Labour\u2019s 1997 election win.",
      "Chess talent",
      "Reeves played chess from an early age, with her father teaching her the key moves. She became a national under-14 champion, and would \"quietly thrash\" any boys who might think they were in for an easy game, according to Ellie.",
      "She has credited chess with teaching her \"to think ahead, to plan a strategy\".",

      "Seeing the extent of cuts at her school, where the library had been turned into a classroom and the sixth form consisted of \"two pre-fab huts in the playground\", she has said she was politicised by her own experience of public services. At the age of 16, she joined the Labour Party.",
      "She went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. As a student, she would host others before college discos, blasting out Destiny's Child songs and dressing up in her room.",

    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",

      "In an initial ruling, the Home Office found there were reasonable grounds to believe that Ms Casimiro could have been a victim of modern slavery.",

      "\"If the UK government does not take action to stop what is happening there will continue to be more victims of modern slavery.\"",

      "A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London.",
      "Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.",
      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",
      "Parts of an amphitheatre are on display under a glass floor at the Guildhall Art Gallery, and at Bloomberg's offices, people can visit the Temple of Mithras, which has been brought to life with an immersive sound and light installation.",
      "Chris Hayward from the City of London Corporation says he wants more people to experience the link between the past and the present.",
      "\"The fact that Roman London is beneath your feet is, frankly, quite a remarkable emotion to experience,\" he said.",
      "\"You can actually see and visualise how Roman London would have been in those times. And then you can walk outside and you can say, 'now look at the skyscrapers, now look at the office blocks', this is progress, but at the same time, progress combined with preservation.\""

    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",

    "summary": "The discovery has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history in the City of London.",
    "story": [
      "A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London.",
      "Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.",
      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",
      "Parts of an amphitheatre are on display under a glass floor at the Guildhall Art Gallery, and at Bloomberg's offices, people can visit the Temple of Mithras, which has been brought to life with an immersive sound and light installation.",
      "Chris Hayward from the City of London Corporation says he wants more people to experience the link between the past and the present.",
      "\"The fact that Roman London is beneath your feet is, frankly, quite a remarkable emotion to experience,\" he said.",
      "\"You can actually see and visualise how Roman London would have been in those times. And then you can walk outside and you can say, 'now look at the skyscrapers, now look at the office blocks', this is progress, but at the same time, progress combined with preservation.\""

      "The request for the data emerged last week.",
      "It applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP).",
      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",
      "They state that Apple does not make different versions of its encryption software for each country it operates in and, therefore, Apple customers in the UK will use the same software as Americans.",
      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

      "The spokesperson added:  \"With AI offering people countless ways to work more efficiently and effectively, the answer cannot be for organisations to outlaw the use of AI and drive staff to use it under the radar.",
      "\"Instead, companies need to offer their staff AI tools that meet their organisational policies and data protection obligations.\"",
      "In the email, Hill Dickinson's chief technology officer said the law firm had detected more than 32,000 hits to the popular chatbot ChatGPT over a seven-day period in January and February.",
      "During the same timeframe, there were also more than 3,000 hits to the Chinese AI service DeepSeek, which was recently banned from Australian government devices over security concerns.",
      "It also highlighted almost 50,000 hits to Grammarly, the writing assistance tool.",
      "However, it is not clear on how many occasions staff visited ChatGPT, DeepSeek, or Grammarly, or how many staff visited repeatedly, as several hits could have been generated by a user during every time they used the websites.",
      "The email to Hill Dickinson employees said: \"We have been monitoring usage of Al tools, particularly publicly available generative Al solutions, and have noticed a significant increase in usage of, and uploading of files to, such tools.\"",

      "Doge has, for example, been blocked by a federal judge from accessing treasury records - in a case that seeks to ensure the agency does not interfere with funding signed off by Congress, which is outside Doge's scope.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

    "story": [
      "Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied.",
      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",
      "Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut.",
      "\"Kindness is cool,\" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.",
      "Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money.",
      "\"I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story\u2026 and often the people who have the least give the most,\" says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers.",
      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",
      "\"Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",
      "She explains that the videos often involve someone being identified as \"in need\". They are then asked for a favour. It might be spare money for a bus fare or help with something.",
      "She argues the participant is being \"lured\" into valuing the needs of someone else, who appears richer, more highly than their own.",
      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him \"feel weird\".",
      "Sometimes large amounts of money are given to vulnerable people, which they might not be in a position to manage.",
      "Mr Dereniowski realised that this might be an issue when he raised $240,000 overnight for a father and son who were living in their car.",
      "After that, more thought goes into longer term help.",
      "\"We've started setting up financial advisors. We've started getting these people jobs. We've helped allocate the funds properly to pay off their debt, their car, helping them get a home and [pay their] rent,\" he says.",

    "story": [
      "Europe's leaders are scrambling. Their hastily convened security summit in Paris on Monday is proof of that.",
      "They are still reeling from not being invited by the US to talks with Russia over the future of Ukraine. US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he could be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin \"very soon\".",
      "Can Europe, under pressure, put political differences and domestic economic concerns aside, and come up with a united front on security spending and on Ukraine's future, including potentially sending troops there - to force themselves a spot at the negotiating table?",
      "They are going to try.",
      "The Trump administration is clearly not 100% sure what it wants to do about Ukraine. There were a number of mixed messages over the weekend.",
      "This allows Europe a tiny window of opportunity to try to persuade the American president it's an invaluable partner.",
      "It hopes to do that via this Paris meeting, getting the ball rolling on two major issues demanded by Donald Trump: That Europe spend and do more for its own defence, and that Europe send troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire.",
      "Europe's leaders insist Kyiv be directly involved in ceasefire talks too. They've long maintained the view that \"there can be no decisions about Ukraine, without Ukraine\".",
      "But it's about even more than that for Europe.",
      "It is the cold realisation - much dreaded, but not entirely unexpected - that the Trump administration does not prioritise relations either with European partners, or their defence.",
      "Europe has relied on a security umbrella provided by the US since World War Two.",
      "Depending on the parameters of the Russia-US talks over Ukraine, and how emboldened Putin feels by them, there is also a European fear this could end up changing their continent's security architecture.",

      "Trump administration's mixed messaging on foreign policy leaves world guessing",
      "Not all European countries will be at Monday's summit. Just those with military heft: the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark - which is expected to represent the Baltic and Nordic nations, plus the EU Council president and the secretary general of the defence alliance, Nato.",
      "Other countries will reportedly have later, follow-up meetings.",
      "Even at the small Paris gathering, it will be hard, if not impossible, to agree concrete defence spending increases. Poland plans to spend 4.47% of its GDP on defence in 2025. The UK is struggling towards, and hasn't yet reached, 2.5% of its GDP.",
      "But leaders can pledge to coordinate better, spend more inside Nato and shoulder most of Ukraine's post-war reconstruction. The EU is expected to bolster its defence effort too.",
      "A large part of the Paris meeting will also focus on the question of sending troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire.",
      "The idea being discussed is not for peacekeeping troops but rather a \"reassurance force\", stationed behind, rather than on, any eventual ceasefire line.",
      "The aim of a European troop presence would be three-fold. To send a message to Ukrainians: that they are not alone. Another message to the US, to show that Europe is \"doing its bit\" for defence of its own continent, and the last message to Moscow, to warn that if it breaks the terms of an eventual ceasefire, it won't be dealing with Kyiv alone.",
      "But it's a controversial concept and may not be popular with voters. In Italy for example, 50% of people asked don't want to send any more weapons to Ukraine, never mind sending sons and daughters, sisters and brothers there.",
      "There are so many as yet unanswered questions:",
      "How many troops would each European country have to send, for how long, and under whose command? What would their mission statement be - for example if Russia broke the terms of an agreed ceasefire, would that mean European soldiers would be directly at war with Russia? Would the US have their back if so?",
      "Europe would want a US security guarantee before deploying soldiers to Ukraine. It may not get one.",
      "It's far too much to be decided on Monday. And leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, come to Paris with their own domestic concerns - can they afford extra defence spending, do they have the troops to send to Ukraine? Germany is nervous about making concrete commitments just before a heated general election.",
      "But this summit is more broad brushstrokes than fine print. The conversation can at least get started publicly.",
      "Will Donald Trump be paying attention?",
      "Hard to know.",
      "There's talk of sending an envoy to Washington after the Paris meeting to make Europe's case. Italy's Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, is close to the Trump administration, for example.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has a planned visit to Washington in a few days. This could be his chance to act as a bridge between Europe and the US.",
      "The Paris meeting also offers an opportunity for the UK and other European leaders to further mend relations after the bitterness of Brexit.",
      "Mark Leonard, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations, notes that Starmer could \"demonstrate that Britain is a responsible stakeholder for European security ... Something that will be noticed and translate into goodwill when it comes to negotiations on other issues\".",
      "Issues like trade relations and law enforcement co-operation which the UK hopes to improve with the EU going forward.",
      "Host nation France is feeling confident. President Macron has long advocated that Europe be less reliant on outside countries for supply chains, tech capabilities and very much so when it comes to defence. He made headlines a year ago by first mooting the idea of troops on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "France is \"fiercely proud\" that its intelligence  and security services are not intertwined with the US, unlike the UK, says Georgina Wright, deputy director for international studies at the Institut Montaigne. That makes it less complicated to untangle, now that Trump is in the White House, demanding that Europe take care of itself.",
      "The US has sent a document to European allies consisting of six points and questions, such as which countries would be willing to deploy troops to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement, and which governments would be prepared to increase sanctions on Russia, including more strictly enforcing existing ones.",
      "But Julianne Smith, until recently the US ambassador to Nato, says this kind of complicated diplomatic work normally takes weeks of meetings and can't be organised by filled-in forms.",
      "She adds that whatever Europe's leaders achieve in Paris, if they use that to demand a seat at the negotiating table over Ukraine, their hand is weak.",
      "\"If Trump blinks and says no, does Europe refuse to help altogether? They can't cut off their nose to spite their face.\"",
      "Essentially, if the US plans to turn away from Ukraine and from Europe more broadly in terms of security, they will have to significantly up their defence game anyway.",

    "title": "Five takeaways from the Munich Security Conference",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 23:53:58 GMT",
    "summary": "The Munich conference exposed tensions between the US and Europe over Nato and Ukraine - the BBC's Frank Gardner explains why this was a watershed in relations.",
    "story": [
      "A series of US declarations rocked last week's Munich Security Conference and caused discord among the European politicians in attendance.",
      "Now US and Russian officials are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia next week to begin negotiations on ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "However, Ukraine and European politicians have not been invited to attend, despite insisting they must be involved for any ceasefire to be credible.",
      "Instead, they will meet in Paris on Monday for an emergency summit to discuss the conflict and the continent's security.",
      "Here are five takeaways from Munich.",
      "1. End of an era",
      "Nato, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was formed in 1949 with the primary aim of blocking expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union.",
      "Now numbering 32 members, including several Eastern European countries, members agree that if one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.",
      "But after this week the post-World War Two security architecture for Europe is no more. America is still in Nato but Europe can no longer automatically rely on the US to come to its aid.",
      "In Brussels, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called on Nato's European members to spend much more on defence, saying they would have to provide the \"overwhelming\" share of military funding for Ukraine.",
      "2. Ukraine policy upended",
      "The US and Russia are going to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine, whether Europe and Ukraine like it or not.",
      "The talks in Saudi Arabia will end a three-year freeze in talking to Vladimir Putin, despite urgent warnings by Kyiv that the Russian leader is not to be trusted.",
      "They follow a phone call between Donald Trump and Putin on Wednesday.",
      "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will be joined by national security adviser Mike Waltz and the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, US officials said.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has repeatedly said he would not accept any deal struck without his country's input, said Kyiv had not been invited to the talks.",
      "3. Spend more now",
      "Europe, everyone agrees, needs to rapidly raise its defence spending if it has any hope of deterring a newly emboldened Russia.",
      "The current Nato-mandated minimum of 2% of GDP is likely to rise to 3%. Russia currently spends more than twice that on defence in percentage terms.",
      "In January, Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national income on defence. Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte has also urged member states to boost their defence spending.",
      "But Europe as a whole has already overtaken the US in terms of aid to Ukraine. In total, it has allocated \u20ac70bn ($73bn; \u00a358bn) in financial and humanitarian aid as well as \u20ac62bn in military aid. This compares to \u20ac64bn in military aid from the US as well as \u20ac50bn in financial and humanitarian allocations.",
      "4. That JD Vance speech",
      "US Vice President JD Vance's blistering attack on Europe's policies on Friday was called \"ill-judged\" and \"insulting\" by many of the delegates at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "They had hoped he would reassure them the US was not abandoning Ukraine.",
      "Instead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.",
      "The address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference.",
      "But the speech appealed to others on both sides of the Atlantic and Donald Trump  called it \"brilliant\".",
      "5. Disunity and discord",
      "While the Munich conference was occupied by the geopolitical, Donald Trump announced plans to bring in a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports from March.",
      "It was evidence there are now very obvious rifts between Washington's positions and Europe's on several issues, from trade to dealing with Russia.",
      "It is a divide that the UK is struggling to bridge, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling reporters both relationships were important and Britain was \"not choosing between the US and the EU\".",
      "But the Trump team's own messaging is sometimes contradictory, rowing back on grand pronouncements the day after they have been made.",
      "Trump administration's mixed messaging on foreign policy leaves world guessing",
      "Ukraine war in maps: How control has shifted in three years",
      "Top US envoy to meet Russian officials for Ukraine peace talks",
      "What is Nato and why isn't Ukraine a member?"

      "The town of Rives along the Obion River was deluged from the breached flood barrier.",
      "Footage shows brown water rushing over rocks and past trees, as rescue workers in red boats pass flooded homes.",
      "Steve Carr, the Obion County mayor, declared a state of emergency on Facebook and said there would be mandatory evacuations in Rives because of \"the rising water, no electricity, and freezing temperature creating a life-threatening situation\".",
      "Located north-east of Memphis, Rives has a population of roughly 300.",
      "West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey issued a state of emergency in 10 counties on Saturday and added another three counties to the list on Sunday.",
      "\"Please continue to be cautious,\" Morrisey said on X.",
      "Kristi Noem, head of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Fema, said she had been in contact with both Governors Beshear and Morrisey, and left voicemails with Governors Bill Lee of Tennessee and Kay Ivey of Alabama.",
      "\"While emergency management is best led by local authorities, we reinforced that DHS stands ready to take immediate action to offer resources and support,\" Noem said.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 13:53:57 GMT",
    "summary": "German voters go to the polls on 23 February in a pivotal vote focused on immigration and the economy.",
    "story": [
      "German voters decide on 23 February who will run their next government, with Friedrich Merz's conservative Christian Democrats favourite to become the biggest party in power.",
      "Controlling immigration and reviving the European Union's biggest economy are the main issues in this snap election, triggered by the collapse of centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition late last year.",
      "We assess what and who you need to know ahead of the vote for Germany's next parliament, the Bundestag.",
      "Why this vote matters",
      "This election is taking place against a backdrop of a series of deadly attacks which have heightened pressure on the mainstream parties to reform immigration and asylum rules.",
      "Germans were already reeling from four fatal attacks, in Mannheim, Solingen, Magdeburg and Afschaffenburg, when a mother and her two-year-old daughter were fatally injured in a car-ramming attack in Munich, allegedly by an Afghan national, 10 days before the election.",
      "These attacks have boosted support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).",
      "Although no other party is prepared to let the AfD into government, if they come second and attract 20% of the vote, they could double their number of seats in the Bundestag.",
      "Germany is also Europe's biggest economy and after two years of decline, the onus is on the next government to turn it around and revive German industry. Germany has been hit by high energy prices and stiff Chinese competition.",
      "Germans aged 18 and over will decide on their next parliament from 08:00-18:00 on 23 February.",
      "There are five candidates for chancellor.",
      "If the biggest party can secure a coalition deal with one or two other parties, the president will usually nominate its leader as chancellor. Then parliament will hold a secret ballot to decide.",
      "Who are the five candidates for German chancellor?",
      "The frontrunner in the race to run Germany is Friedrich Merz, whose Christian Democrats (CDU) are up to 10 points ahead in the polls. He was chosen as candidate for chancellor ahead of Markus S\u00f6der, the leader of their sister party in Bavaria the Christian Social Union.",
      "Aged 69 and 198cm (6ft 6in) in height, Merz is a plain-talking, pro-business, social conservative who has spent years waiting in the wings.",
      "Eclipsed in the CDU by Angela Merkel in 2002, he eventually left politics, served on the boards of investment banks and took up flying as an amateur pilot.",
      "Merz's first two bids to win the CDU leadership failed, against Merkel in 2018 and then Armin Laschet who went on to lose the German election in 2021.",
      "Merz then took over the CDU and is running under the slogan \"A Germany we can be proud of again\".",
      "He has promised permanent border controls and faster asylum rules to restrict immigration, and to cut taxes and slash \u20ac50bn in welfare spending in a bid to kickstart Germany's faltering economy. He has also promised to bolster aid for Ukraine.",
      "But he provoked a furious backlash ahead of the election when he sought to tighten immigration rules by relying on the votes of the far-right AfD, and he ultimately failed.",
      "Although Merz has ruled out working with the AfD, former CDU chancellor Angela Merkel said he was \"wrong\" to accept AfD votes and he has faced big protests.",
      "He has also promised greater leadership from Germany in Europe, and beefed-up support for Ukraine, refusing to rule out future membership of Nato.",
      "Germany's front-runner Merz: Risk-taker who flirted with far right",
      "German frontrunner vows permanent border controls after knife attack",
      "Olaf Scholz has already served more than three years as chancellor, at the head of an unpopular coalition that fell apart in a row over loosening Germany's strict debt rules.",
      "His government struggled from the start, largely because of the effect of Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine on Germany's economy.",
      "Germany became Ukraine's biggest aid-provider in Europe. Scholz spoke of a Zeitenwende (turning point) in boosting German defence policy and military spending - but he was accused of acting too slowly or too late. He now promises European support for Ukraine \"for as long as necessary\" and rejects the idea of any dictated peace.",
      "Scholz has backed faster deportation of failed asylum seekers and his government reimposed border checks which he says have brought asylum requests down by a third in one year.",
      "Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) want to establish a \"Germany fund\" to boost investment and to raise the minimum wage to \u20ac15 (\u00a312.50) an hour from \u20ac12.82.",
      "Many in party believed he should have allowed party colleague Boris Pistorius to run for chancellor instead.",
      "However, the party has joined conservatives in the past and although Scholz said he could no longer trust Merz, the Social Democrats remain potential partners.",
      "Germany engulfed by political crisis as Scholz coalition falls apart",
      "Alice Weidel, 46, is the AfD first candidate for chancellor since the party was created in 2013. She has also basked in the support of billionaire Elon Musk, and was rewarded with a meeting with US Vice-President JD Vance during his visit to Munich.",
      "Weidel has little chance of winning power, but she has become popular with young voters on TikTok and her party has set its sights on four years' time.",
      "Co-led by Tino Chrupalla, the AfD has already secured one recent victory, in September's state election in Thuringia in the east.",
      "Elon Musk said the ex-Goldman Sachs analyst could not be right wing extremist as she \"has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka\".",
      "And yet she has backed the mass deportation of migrants, embracing the highly controversial term \"remigration\" - which she defines as deporting criminals and \"illegal\" migrants.",
      "She also wants to end sanctions on Russia, repairing the destroyed Nord Stream gas pipelines; and she wants to tear down wind turbines, which she calls \"windmills of shame\", even though they now provide a quarter of Germany's electricity.",
      "Party supporters have cheered her with the slogan Alice f\u00fcr Deutschland (Alice for Germany), which sounds similar to a banned Nazi slogan Alles f\u00fcr Deutschland.",
      "AfD embraces mass deportation of migrants as German election nears",
      "Robert Habeck's Greens played a key role in the Scholz government as vice-chancellor and economy minister.",
      "But one of his flagship policies, phasing out fossil-fuel heating systems in Germany, had to be watered down and led to a dive in the government's poll ratings. He rejects any return to nuclear energy, and calls for more affordable access to renewable energy which by the end of last year supplied 63.4% of Germany's electricity needs.",
      "Habeck, 55, has taken a strong line on aid for Ukraine, and he has forcefully criticised Friedrich Merz for relying on votes from the AfD in parliament.",
      "Relations with Friedrich Merz are awkward, after he accused the CDU leader of disqualifying himself as chancellor, but the Greens could still return to government.",
      "Like Alice Weidel's AfD, Sahra Wagenknecht and her BSW party back closer relations with Russia and has built a strong support base in eastern Germany.",
      "Wagenknecht calls her politics \"left conservativism\" and presents herself as an alternative to the AfD, backing strict limits on asylum and immigration.",
      "She shares the AfD's opposition to German military support for Ukraine and has been accused of parroting Kremlin narratives on the war.",
      "But she may struggle to reach the 5% national threshold to get into parliament.",
      "How does voting work?",
      "Elections to the Bundestag usually take place every four years - this one had been due on 28 September 2025 but was brought forward because of the collapse of the Scholz government.",
      "Over-18s get two votes.",
      "One is to elect members of the Bundestag directly in 299 constituencies. The second is to choose a political party in one of the 16 states that you live in.",
      "Any party that wins 5% of that second vote is allowed to enter the Bundestag, and they then use their state lists to pick their MPs.",
      "Complex voting rules that meant the outgoing parliament had 733 seats have now been abolished. That means Germany's next Bundestag will have a total of 630 seats - a reduction of more than 100 seats.",
      "However, one of the old rules will remain. Any party that fails to poll 5% of the vote can still get in, if they win in three of the 299 constituencies.",
      "Which parties could form Germany's next government?",
      "The conservative CDU and CSU parties are favourite to win the most seats, but by ruling out a coalition with the AfD Merz has narrowed their options of potential partners in government.",
      "That makes a deal most likely with either or both the SPD and the Greens.",
      "Many in the SPD are reluctant to work with Merz after the migration row, but a so-called grand coalition of the two parties is considered possible."

    "summary": "Eyewitnesses and relatives of victims spoke of their pain and trauma after a crush at an overcrowded railway station claimed 18 lives.",
    "story": [
      "On Sunday morning, the New Delhi Railway Station in India's capital looked much like it always does: bustling, with its many platforms full of eager, impatient passengers waiting to catch their trains.",
      "But on Saturday night, a deadly crush - reportedly caused by overcrowding - killed at least 18 people and left several injured.",
      "According to officials, two trains had been delayed at the station, while a third - heading to Prayagraj city where the massive Hindu religious festival, Kumbh Mela, is being held - was waiting to depart as people pushed against each other.",
      "The crush occurred after \"a passenger slipped and fell on the stairs\", a spokesperson for Indian Railways said.",
      "Opposition leaders have criticised the government, alleging that Indian Railways did not make adequate arrangements to manage crowds at the station.",
      "An investigation has been launched, and authorities have announced compensation for the victims.",
      "When asked by the BBC about safety and security at the station, Pankaj Gangwar, Principal Chief Security Commissioner of Northern Railway, said \"let the investigation be completed first\".",
      "Crushes like these are not unheard of in India, where there is frequent overcrowding at religious events, festivals and public spaces. Last month, 30 people were killed and dozens injured in a crush at the Kumbh Mela.",
      "Crowds at the railway station were also not unexpected - trains are by far the cheapest long-distance mode of transport in India and it is common for the number of passengers to far exceed the capacity of trains.",
      "Eyewitnesses and the families of victims have been recounting their ordeal. Many of them were angry at authorities and police officials at the railway station, who they say did not act in time.",
      "Some eyewitnesses said the crush was not limited to one place but took place on the overhead bridge, staircases and platforms.",
      "Bipin Jha was at the station to meet his wife Mamta, who was arriving on a train. She died in the crush.",
      "\"I met her at the platform and we were walking on the footbridge overhead when she was trapped in the crush. She died in front of my eyes. I will live my life with the guilt of not saving her,\" he says.",
      "\"We were on the stairs, suddenly we felt a push from behind. We fell, along with many others, and were trapped under bodies. I was barely breathing,\" said Seema, whose sister-in law Pinky Devi died on the staircase.",
      "Usha Devi, who was travelling to the eastern state of Bihar for her nephew's wedding, said chaos erupted the moment she reached the platform.",
      "\"Many people fell. Everywhere, there were scattered belongings, food items and clothes. I was on the verge of fainting. So many people were collapsing. The crowd was so dense that we couldn't board our train.\"",
      "Umesh Giri's wife Shilam Devi was among the victims.",
      "\"The crowd became uncontrollable,\" he told BBC Hindi while waiting outside the mortuary at Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College.",
      "\"I saw several bodies already lying there. People were colliding with each other, and others started falling over them,\" said Mr Giri, who was also injured.",
      "He added that help took time to arrive and that he pleaded with officers for help.",
      "Senior police and railway officials at the scene did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "Most of the victims were taken to the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital in New Delhi, where police and paramilitary forces were deployed, and railway authorities had set up a help desk to assist families. Journalists were not allowed to enter the hospital on Saturday.",
      "Relatives of victims shared their grief with reporters waiting outside, while also expressing anger at the facilities in the hospital.",
      "\"Multiple people were crammed onto a single bed,\" alleged Shobha, the sister-in-law of Shilam Devi.",
      "Others coming out of the hospital also confirmed this. Hospital authorities did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "At Lady Hardinge Hospital, the grieving family of Riya, 7, completed the paperwork so they could receive her body.",
      "\"No child deserves to die like this\", her uncle Vivek said, wiping away tears.",

    "story": [
      "A stabbing in Austria that killed a 14-year-old boy and wounded five others was an Islamist attack, Austrian officials have said.",
      "The attack took place on Saturday at Villach, a town near the border with Italy and Slovenia, and three of those who were injured remain in intensive care, authorities said.",
      "A 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker, who was detained at the scene, has been charged with murder and attempted murder.",
      "Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said an Islamic State group flag had been found in the suspect's apartment, while state police chief Michaela Kohlweiss said he had sworn allegiance to the group.",
      "Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Karner said this was an \"Islamist attack with IS links by an attacker who, according to the investigations so far, was obviously radicalised online, via the internet, within a very short space of time\".",
      "\"So those in a position of responsibility, the police, the authorities, must draw the necessary conclusions from that.\"",
      "Karner said the suspect had a valid residence permit, no criminal record, and had not previously attracted the attention of authorities.",
      "Authorities previously said the suspect had a temporary residence permit and was waiting for a decision on his asylum application.",
      "The attack took place around 16:00 local time (15:00 GMT) near the town's main square.",

      "Three are in intensive care, one is in a stable condition and another is receiving outpatient treatment.",
      "A delivery worker, also a Syrian man, who had driven his vehicle at the attacker helped prevent more injuries, police said.",
      "The attack comes amid a national debate over asylum laws and an election last year that saw the far-right Freedom Party come out on top for the first time.",
      "The party has failed to form a coalition government, leaving Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen weighing up whether to call a snap election, form a minority government or invite other parties or a group of experts to try and form an administration.",
      "Herbert Kickl, the head of the Freedom Party, seized on the Villach attack, saying on Saturday that Austria needs a \"rigorous crackdown on asylum\".",
      "On Sunday, Karner said there needed to be \"legal reforms\" for police and authorities and called for screenings of certain groups, such as asylum seekers from Syria and Afghanistan."

      "\u200b\u200bPresident Donald Trump has always understood the power of branding. As a celebrity businessman, he affixed his name to the facades of his skyscrapers and licensed his name to an array of products, from hotels to wines.",
      "Now, he is attempting his boldest branding campaign yet: America itself.",
      "On his first day back in office, he signed an order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. Denali, the indigenous name for the famed Alaskan peak, will revert back to Mount McKinley, a reference to the assassinated 19th century president.",
      "Fort Bragg, which was named for a Confederate general until the military changed it to Fort Liberty, will again bear its original name \u2013 but this time attributed to a far less controversial soldier from World War Two.",
      "Trump is not the first US president to rename a monument. It was Barack Obama, a Democrat, who renamed Mount McKinley to its Native American name, Denali, after years of lobbying from Alaskans.",
      "George W Bush, a Republican, renamed the Caribbean National Forest in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to the El Yunque National Forest in 2007, to reflect the US territory's heritage.",
      "And after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 sparked a national reckoning on race, Congress initiated a process to rename US military bases named after Confederate figures. In 2023, during Joe Biden's presidency, the Department of Defense renamed nine US military bases, including Fort Bragg.",
      "At the heart of these decisions is a desire to portray America, and its values, in a particular light.",
      "\"The act of naming is a way that presidents can reshape their vision of the nation,\" said Allison Prasch, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies political rhetoric.",
      "Trump's choices in his second term send a clear message about his priorities too, she said.",

      "The chosen ones \u2013 9 people trusted to deliver for Trump",
      "Some of Trump's name choices are callbacks to America's expansionist age, when the prevailing ideology said that America had a God-given mission to expand from shore to shore.",
      "Part of President William McKinley's legacy was his role in annexing Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines and Hawaii. In changing Denali's name, Trump said he wanted to honour McKinley because he \"made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent\".",
      "It's an ideology that seems to inform Trump today too, as he has also floated the idea of retaking the Panama Canal, which had once been under US control, buying Greenland and annexing Canada to become the \"51st state\".",
      "Meanwhile, renaming Fort Bragg is the latest in an ongoing debate over the legacy of the Confederacy \u2013 the coalition of southern states that seceded from the US over the issue of slavery and triggered the Civil War.",
      "During Trump's first administration, amid a national reckoning over racial injustice, Congress required the Pentagon to rename facilities named after Confederates and banned future military installations from being named after them.",
      "The move rankled Trump then, who tried to veto the measure and declared that \"our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with!\" Congress overrode him with bipartisan support.",
      "But historian Connor Williams, who served on the renaming committee that had recommended the name Bragg be removed in 2021, said that honouring the Confederacy is misguided.",
      "\"What makes Confederates such bad topics for commemoration is that they have very little to redeem them,\" Williams said. \"They committed treason against the United States.\"",
      "\"What we commemorate, what we celebrate, what public displays we make, where we place wreathes \u2013 the president does have that ability to signal what he thinks is important,\" he added.",
      "In 2023, the Biden administration changed Fort Bragg, named after Confederate general Braxton Bragg, to Fort Liberty.",
      "\"We seized this opportunity to make ourselves better and to seek excellence,\" Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue said at the renaming ceremony. \"That is what we always have done and always will do.\"",
      "However, the name change prompted mixed feelings among lawmakers, former military personnel who spent time there, and the local community.",
      "\"I understand the reasoning behind the change, and I have to accept it because it's what the elected leadership has determined is in the best interest,\" Cumberland County Commissioner Jimmy Keefe said at the time according to local media. \"But I hate that so many people who have had positive experiences at Fort Bragg, who have had children born there, weddings there, that they will no longer have that tether of Fort Bragg in the name.\"",
      "This week, Trump's new Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, restored the base's name to Fort Bragg.  But this time, he said the base will be named after Private First Class Roland Bragg, who fought in World War II, rather than a Confederate general.",
      "\"That's right,\" Hegseth said. \"Bragg is back.\"",
      "Republican lawmakers representing the base expressed enthusiasm about the change.",
      "\"Renaming Fort Bragg for Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, who earned the Silver Star and Purple Heart in WWII, was always the right decision,\" North Carolina Senator Ted Budd wrote on Facebook.",
      "But nationally, many of Trump's name changes have proved controversial. A Marquette University poll suggested that 71% of US adults did not support changing the Gulf of Mexico's name, and just 29% supported it.",
      "Some of the changes have sparked debates about whose vision of American history should officially stand.",
      "A poll by Alaska Survey Research suggested 47% of Alaska's Trump's voters favoured the name change. But overall, Alaskans opposed the name change by a two-to-one margin, the Juneau Express reported.",
      "Democrats and Republicans in Alaska's legislature banded together to pass a resolution urging Trump not to change Denali's name.",

      "Google says this data is already widely used by other companies, and it continues to encourage responsible data use.",
      "However the company had previously come out strongly against this kind of data collection, saying in a 2019 blog that fingerprinting \"subverts user choice and is wrong.\"",
      "But in a post announcing the new rule changes, Google said the way people used the internet - such as devices like smart TVs and consoles - meant it was harder to target ads to users using conventional data collection, which users control with cookie consent.",

      "Google told the BBC in a statement: \"Privacy-enhancing technologies offer new ways for our partners to succeed on emerging platforms... without compromising on user privacy.\"",

      "Fingerprinting collects information about a person's device and browser and puts it together to create a profile of that person.",
      "The information is not explicitly collected in order to advertise to people, but it can be used to target specific ads based on that user's data.",
      "For example, a person's screen size or language settings are legitimately needed in order to display a website properly.",
      "But when that is combined with their time zone, browser type, battery level - and many other data points - it can create a unique combination of settings which makes it easier to work out who is using a web service.",
      "These details along with someone's IP address - the unique identifier used by internet devices - were previously prohibited by Google for ad targeting.",
      "Privacy campaigners say that unlike cookies, which are small files stored on a local device, users have little control over whether they send fingerprinting information to advertisers.",
      "\"By explicitly allowing a tracking technique that they previously described as incompatible with user control, Google highlights its ongoing prioritisation of profits over privacy,\" said Lena Cohen, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.",

    "story": [
      "For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequi\u00e8s, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.",
      "I expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.",
      "It's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.",
      "Her husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.",
      "A friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.",

      "The railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.",
      "While I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.",
      "There is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.",
      "There is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.",
      "The Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.",

In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.",
      "Various conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died \u2013 I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".",
      "Ever since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.",
      "I asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.",
      "He replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 01:00:34 GMT",
    "summary": "The controversial ruling once again shines a spotlight on the issue of marital rape in India, which refuses to criminalise it.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details",
      "An Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.",
      "The controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.",
      "Earlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.",
      "The lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.",
      "But on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.",
      "The judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.",
      "\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.",
      "\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"",
      "Priyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".",
      "She added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger.",
      "\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"",
      "The court documents make for grim reading.",
      "According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".",
      "After he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.",
      "In her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".",
      "A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.",
      "While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.",
      "Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.",
      "The lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".",
      "\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"",
      "Considering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.",
      "India is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.",
      "A number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.",
      "The British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.",
      "Britain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.",
      "India government says criminalising marital rape 'excessively harsh'In India, growing clamour to criminalise rape within marriage",
      "India government says criminalising marital rape 'excessively harsh'",
      "In India, growing clamour to criminalise rape within marriage",
      "The idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.",
      "But in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.",
      "The Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move.",
      "In October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".",
      "Authorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.",
      "\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.",
      "\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.",
      "Violence within marriage is rampant in India.",
      "According to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.",
      "And even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.",
      "\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Ms Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.",
      "\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"",
      "She added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".",
      "\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\""

    "story": [
      "A Russian drone has hit the protective shelter over Chernobyl's damaged nuclear reactor, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.",
      "The overnight strike at the site of the world's worst nuclear accident caused a fire that has since been extinguished, he added.",
      "The UN's nuclear watchdog (the IAEA) said radiation levels inside and outside Chernobyl were normal and stable - but later the plant's chief engineer, Oleksandr Titarchuk, said the possibility of radioactive substances leaking \"now exists\".",
      "Russia has denied any claims it attacked Chernobyl, stating its military does not strike Ukrainian nuclear infrastructure and \"any claims that this was the case do not correspond to reality\".",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which monitors nuclear safety around the world, said fire safety personnel and vehicles responded within minutes to an overnight explosion. No casualties were reported, the agency added.",

      "Mr Titarchuk told Ukraine's state news agency that \"the situation is under control\".",
      "A catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 sent a plume of radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.",
      "While the immediate disaster was mitigated and an area where people were told not to live established, the incident saw a rise in cancer rates in the surrounding population.",
      "The radiation shield is designed to prevent further radioactive material leaking out over the next century. It measures 275m (900ft) wide and 108m (354ft) tall and cost $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) to construct.",

      "Since 1990, Prof Jim Smith from the UK's University of Portsmouth has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and, while he admits the strike was a \"horrendous attack on a very important structure\", he is \"not concerned\" about the radiation risk.",

      "The shield \"was never built to withstand external drone attack\", he told the BBC, but a \"complex piece of decommissioning kit\" built to contain the radioactive materials inside and to help safely deconstruct the broken reactor.",
      "The strike appeared to hit the maintenance system of a crane designed to remotely take the reactor apart, he said.",
      "There appears to be \"pretty serious\" damage to the outer and inner cladding, he added, but said a fuller assessment of the damage will be needed before the bank can determine its costs.",
      "Mr Evans said the mission to build the shelter was the \"world's largest ever collaboration on nuclear safety\", with more than 40 counties working together on it.",
      "\"Ever since the start of the war, it's been tragic to see that international co-operation undermined by reckless acts,\" he added.",

      "Only a small portion of the work has been exhibited since the 1979 Iranian Revolution but in recent years, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has been showcasing some of its most captivating pieces.",
      "The Eye to Eye exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in October 2024, was extended twice due to overwhelming public demand, running until January 2025.",
      "The display was widely regarded as one of the most significant exhibitions in the history of the museum, and it also became its most visited.",
      "The showcase featured more than 15 works unveiled for the first time, including a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet - marking its first-ever appearance in an Iranian exhibition.",
      "From abstract expressionism to pop art, the collection at the museum serves as a time capsule of pivotal artistic movements.",

      "Many artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications.",
      "Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil.",

      "Picasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period.",
      "And there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882.",
      "But for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention.",
      "Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says.",
      "Challenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget. Shifting political priorities mean that it often functions more as a cultural hub than a traditional museum.",

      "If Pew and CMS estimates are accurate, nearly one in four Indian immigrants in the US is undocumented - an unlikely scenario given migration patterns, the study says. (Indian immigrants are one of the fastest-growing groups in the US, surging from 600,000 in 1990 to 3.2 million in 2022.)",
      "The DHS estimated in 2022 that the undocumented Indian population in the US dropped 60% from its 2016 peak, falling from 560,000 to 220,000.",
      "How did the number of undocumented Indians drop so steeply from 2016 to 2022? Mr Kapur says the data doesn't provide a clear answer, but plausible explanations could be that some obtained legal status while others returned, particularly due to COVID-related hardships.",
      "However, this estimate doesn't reflect a 2023 surge in Indians at US borders, meaning the actual number could now be higher.",
      "Despite rising border encounters, US government estimates show no clear increase in the overall undocumented Indian population from the US financial year (FY) 2020 to 2022, according to the study.",
      "Encounters refer to instances where non-citizens are stopped by US authorities while attempting to cross the country's borders with Mexico or Canada.",
      "Visa overstays by Indians have remained steady at 1.5% since 2016.",
      "The number of Indian recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) has also declined from 2,600 in 2017 to 1,600 in 2024. The Daca programme protects migrants who came to the US as children.",
      "To sum up: the undocumented Indian population grew both in numbers and as a share of all unauthorised migrants, rising from 0.8% in 1990 to 3.9% in 2015 before dropping to 2% in 2022.",
      "A surge - and shifting migration routes",
      "The US has two main land borders.",
      "The southern border along the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas bordering Mexico sees the most migrant crossings. Then there's the US-Canada border spanning 11 states.",
      "Before 2010, encounters involving Indians at the two borders were minimal, never exceeding 1,000.",
      "Since 2010, nearly all encounters involving Indians occurred along the US-Mexico southern border.",
      "In FY 2024, encounters of Indian nationals on the northern border surged to 36% of all Indian crossings, up from just 4% the previous year.",
      "Canada had become a more accessible entry point for Indians, with a shorter visitor visa processing times than US.",
      "Also, there was a surge in attempted border crossings from 2021 onwards, and the encounters at the Mexico border peaked in 2023.",
      "\"This is not specific to Indians. It is part of a larger surge of migrants trying to come into the US after Biden was elected. It is as if there was a high tide of migrants and Indians were a part of it,\" Mr Kapur told me.",
      "Where are the illegal Indians staying?",
      "The study finds that the states with the largest Indian immigrant populations -California (112,000), Texas (61,000), New Jersey (55,000), New York (43,000) and Illinois (31,000) - also have the highest numbers of unauthorised Indian immigrants.",
      "Indians make up a significant share of the total unauthorised population in Ohio (16%), Michigan (14%), New Jersey (12%) and Pennsylvania (11%).",
      "Meanwhile, states where more than 20% of Indian immigrants are unauthorised include Tennessee, Indiana, Georgia, Wisconsin and California.",
      "\"We expect this because it's easier to blend in and find work in an ethnic business - like a Gujarati working for a Gujarati-American or a Punjabi/Sikh in a similar setup,\" Mr Kapur told me.",
      "Who are the Indians seeking asylum?",
      "The US immigration system allows people who are detained at the border who fear persecution in their home countries to undergo credible \"fear screenings\". Those who pass can seek asylum in court, leading to a rise in asylum applications alongside rising border apprehensions.",
      "Administrative data doesn't reveal the exact demographics of Indian asylum seekers, but court records on spoken languages provide some insight.",
      "Punjabi-speakers from India have dominated Indian asylum claims since 2001. After Punjabi, Indian asylum seekers spoke Hindi (14%), English (8%) and Gujarati (7%).",
      "They have filed 66% of asylum cases from FY 2001\u20132022, suggesting Punjab and the neighbouring state of Haryana as key migrant sources.",
      "Punjabi speakers from India also had the highest asylum approval rate (63%), followed by Hindi speakers (58%). In contrast, only a quarter of Gujarati speakers' cases were approved.",
      "'Gaming the system' - why asylum claims are rising",
      "US data collected by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Indian asylum requests in the US have skyrocketed.",
      "The requests jumped tenfold in just two years, rising from about 5,000 in 2021 to over 51,000 in 2023.",
      "While this spike is most dramatic in the US, similar trends are seen in Canada, the UK and Australia, where Indians are among the largest asylum-seeking groups, the study says.",
      "Mr Kapur believes this is \"largely a way to game the asylum system rather than an objective fear of persecution, as processing takes years\".",
      "Given the large number of Punjabi-speakers who seek asylum, it's unclear what has changed in the northern Indian state ruled by the Congress party (2017-22) and latterly the Aam Aadmi Party (2022\u2013present) to drive this surge.",
      "Under Trump's second presidency, asylum requests are set to plummet.",
      "Within his first week, a key app for migrants was shut down and removed from app stores, cancelling nearly 300,000 pending appointments, including asylum cases already in progress.",
      "What do asylum seekers tell us about India?",
      "US data shows most Indian asylum seekers are Punjabi and Gujarati - groups from India's wealthier states, better able to afford high migration costs.",
      "In contrast, Indian Muslims and marginalised communities and people from conflict zones like the regions affected by Maoist violence and Kashmir, rarely seek asylum, the study says.",
      "So most Indian asylum seekers are economic migrants, not from the country's poorest or conflict-hit regions.",
      "The arduous journey to the US - whether via Latin America or as \"fake\" students in Canada - costs 30-100 times India's per capita income, making it accessible only to those with assets to sell or pledge, the study says.",
      "Not surprisingly, Punjab and Gujarat - top origin states for unauthorised Indians -  are among India's wealthier regions, where land values far exceed returns from farming.",
      "\"Even illegality takes a lot of money to pursue,\" the study says.",
      "What's fuelling illegal Indian migration?",
      "While rising asylum claims may seem linked to \"democratic backsliding\" in India, correlation isn't causation, the authors say .",
      "Punjab and Gujarat have long histories of emigration, with migrants heading not just to the US but also the UK, Canada and Australia.",
      "Remittances - India received an estimated $120bn in 2023 - fuel aspirations for a better life, driven not by poverty but \"relative deprivation\", as families seek to match the success of others abroad, the study says.",
      "A parallel industry of agents and brokers in India has cashed in on this demand.",
      "The Indian government, says the study, \"has looked the other way, likely because the issue of illegal migration is much more a burden for receiving than sending countries\".",
      "How many Indians have been deported?",
      "Between 2009 and 2024, around 16,000 Indians were deported, according to India's ministry of external affairs.",
      "These deportations averaged 750 per year under Obama, 1,550 under Trump's first term, and 900 under Biden.",
      "Indian migrant removals spiked between FY 2023 and 2024, but the peak was in 2020 with nearly 2,300 deportations.",

    "summary": "The BBC examines the chaos left behind after Iran had to abandon its military bases in Syria.",
    "story": [
      "Mouldy half-finished food on bunk beds, discarded military uniforms and abandoned weapons - these are the remnants of an abrupt retreat from this base that once belonged to Iran and its affiliated groups in Syria.",
      "The scene tells a story of panic. The forces stationed here fled with little warning, leaving behind a decade-long presence that unravelled in mere weeks.",
      "Iran was Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most critical ally for more than 10 years. It deployed military advisers, mobilised foreign militias, and invested heavily in Syria's war.",
      "Its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) built deep networks of underground bases, supplying arms and training to thousands of fighters. For Iran, this was also part of its \"security belt\" against Israel.",
      "We are near Khan Shaykhun town in Idlib province. Before Assad's regime fell on 8 December, it was one of the key strategic locations for the IRGC and its allied groups.",
      "From the main road, the entrance is barely visible, hidden behind piles of sand and rocks. A watchtower on a hilltop, still painted in the colours of the Iranian flag, overlooks the base.",
      "A receipt notebook confirms the base's name: The Position of Martyr Zahedi -  named after Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a top IRGC commander who was assassinated in an alleged Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria on 1 April, 2024.",
      "The supplies recently ordered - we found receipts for chocolates, rice, cooking oil - suggest daily life continued here until the last moments. But now the base has new occupants - two armed Uyghur fighters from Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist militant group whose leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has become the new interim president of Syria.",
      "The Uyghurs arrived suddenly in a military vehicle, asking for our media accreditation.",
      "\"Iranians were here. They all fled,\" one of them says, speaking in his mother tongue, a dialect of Turkish. \"Whatever you see here is from them. Even these onions and the leftover foods.\"",
      "Boxes full of fresh onions in the courtyard have now germinated.",
      "The base is a labyrinth of tunnels dug deep into white rocky hills. There are bunk beds in some rooms with no windows. The roof of one of the corridors is draped in fabric in the colours of the Iranian flag and there are a few Persian books on a rocky shelf.",
      "They left behind documents containing sensitive information. All in Persian, they have details of fighters' personal information, military personnel codes, home addresses, spouses' names and mobile phone numbers in Iran. From the names, it's clear that several fighters in this base were from the Afghan brigade that was formed by Iran to fight in Syria.",
      "Sources linked to Iran-backed groups told BBC Persian that the base houses mainly Afghan forces accompanied by Iranian \"military advisers\" and their Iranian commanders.",
      "Tehran's main justification for its military involvement in Syria was \"to fight against jihadi groups\" and to protect \"Shia holy shrines\" against radical Sunni militants.",

      "Multiple sources close to the IRGC told the BBC that most of the forces had to flee to Iraq, and some were ordered to go to Lebanon or Russian bases to be evacuated from Syria by the Russians.",
      "An HTS fighter, Mohammad al Rabbat, had witnessed the group's advance from Idlib to Aleppo and Syria's capital Damascus.",
      "He says they thought their operation would take \"about a year\" and best, they'd \"capture Aleppo in three to six months\". But to their surprise, they entered Aleppo in a matter of days.",
      "The regime's rapid downfall was brought about by a chain of events after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.",
      "That attack led to an escalation of Israeli air strikes against the IRGC and Iran-backed groups in Syria and a war against another key Iranian ally \u2013 the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose leader was killed in an air strike.",
      "This \"situation of psychological collapse\" for Iran and Hezbollah was central to their downfall, says 35-year-old fighter Rabbat.",
      "But the most crucial blow came from within: there was a rift between Assad and his Iran-linked allies, he says.",
      "\"There was a complete breakdown of trust and military co-operation between them. IRGC-linked groups were blaming Assad of betrayal and believing that he is giving up their locations to Israel.\"",
      "As we pass through Khan Shaykhun, we come across a street painted in the colours of the Iranian flag. It leads to a school building that was being used as an Iranian headquarters.",
      "On the wall at the entrance of the toilets, slogans read: \"Down with Israel\" and \"Down with the USA\".",
      "It was evident that these headquarters were also evacuated at short notice. We found documents classified as \"highly sensitive\".",

      "His neighbour's home was turned into a military post. \"They sat there with their guns pointing at the road, treating us all as suspects,\" he recalls.",
      "Most of the fighters didn't even speak Arabic, he says. \"They were Afghans, Iranians, Hezbollah. But we referred to them all as Iranians because Iran was controlling them.\"",
      "Abdullah's wife Jourieh says she is happy that the \"Iranian militias\" have left, but still remembers the \"stressful\" moment before their withdrawal. She had thought they would be trapped in crossfire as Iran-backed groups were fortifying their positions and getting ready to fight, but then \"they just vanished in a few hours\".",
      "\"This was an occupation. Iranian occupation,\" says Abdo who, like others, has just returned here with his family after 10 years. His house had also become a military base.",
      "I observed this anger towards Iran and a softer attitude towards Russia in many conversations with Syrians.",
      "I asked Rabbat, the HTS fighter, why this was.",
      "\"Russians were dropping bombs from the sky and other than that, they were in their bases while Iranians and their militias were on the ground interacting. People were feeling their presence, and many weren't happy with it,\" he explained.",
      "This feeling is reflected in Syria's new rulers' policy towards Iran.",
      "The new authorities have put a ban on Iranian nationals, alongside Israelis, entering Syria. But there is no such ban against Russians.",
      "Iran's embassy, which was stormed by angry protesters after the fall of the regime, remains closed.",
      "The reaction of Iranian officials towards developments in Syria has been contradictory.",

      "Back at the abandoned base, Iran's military expansion was still under way even in the last days. Next to the camp were more tunnels under construction, apparently the beginnings of a field hospital. The cement on the walls was still wet and the paint fresh.",

      "Navalnaya now lives abroad, facing arrest if she were to return to Russia.",
      "Her words capture just how far ambitions have shrunk.",
      "For years, Alexei Navalny was Vladimir Putin's biggest political rival: charismatic and courageous. Today, even his lawyers have been jailed as \"extremists\" and a huge number of supporters have fled Russia for safety. Those who've stayed are mostly scared into silence.",
      "Now Vladimir Putin, far from being defeated by a ruinous war on Ukraine, looks like dictating the terms of a peace deal there alongside Donald Trump.",
      "So did Russia's democratic opposition and its dream of change die in an Arctic prison yard with Alexei Navalny?",
      "Squeezing Russia's democratic life",
      "Ksenia Fadeeva was serving a nine-year sentence when the TV in her cell announced that Navalny was dead. He had collapsed in prison on his daily walk.",
      "\"I was in a stupor; I couldn't even speak,\" the activist remembers. \"It was a nightmare.\"",
      "Ksenia was a political prisoner herself, labelled an \"extremist\" for her previous links to Navalny. She managed his HQ in her Siberian hometown, Tomsk, when Navalny tried to run against Putin in the 2018 presidential elections. He was blocked.",
      "Back then, Ksenia showed me how her car had been coated in paint and had its tyres slashed. On another day the door of her flat was sealed shut with foam glue, trapping her inside.",
      "The young activist shrugged all this off. It came with the territory.",
      "At that point, Putin had been squeezing the democratic life out of Russia for close to two decades. He'd moved from controlling the media to rigging elections and punishing protest. Then came poisoning and political assassination.",
      "This month also marks 10 years since Boris Nemtsov, another powerful voice of opposition, was killed. He was shot in the back close to the red walls of the Kremlin.",
      "Russia had annexed Crimea illegally the previous year and Putin's approval rating was still riding a wave of toxic nationalism. Critics like Nemtsov were publicly slurred as traitors.",
      "The politician's lifeless body, sprawled beneath fairy lights in the colours of the Russian flag, marked the start of a dark new era.",
      "Opposition criminalised and exported",
      "Navalny did his best to breathe new life into Russia's beleaguered opposition.",
      "A master of social media and of the anti-corruption agenda, he had real appeal, especially to a younger crowd.",

      "\"I knew they could put you in prison, break up protests with batons, invent criminal charges. But poisoning with a chemical weapon?\" Ksenia Fadeeva remembers her shock at the attack. \"I thought there were some brakes on the system, but I was wrong.\"",

      "\"I don't think there is any country in the world where many would risk years in prison for speaking out,\" Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent activist, wrote to me once from his own jail cell.",
      "Sentenced to 25 years for condemning Russian war crimes in Ukraine, Kara-Murza smarted at criticism of Russians for failing to stand up to Putin more firmly and failing to stop the full-scale invasion.",
      "Navalny was already in jail. A spattering of anti-war protests was quickly stamped out.",
      "\"Inside Russia, it's not a matter of there being no one with the charisma of Navalny,\" Tatiana Stanovaya, senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia-Eurasia Centre says, explaining the lack of any new leader since his death.",

      "\"In today's tough conditions, I don't know where you find another leader like Navalny.\"",
      "In a holding pattern",

      "Their latest film targets a powerful ally of Putin, Igor Sechin, arguing that Putin is only pretending to \"make Russia great\" while he and his cronies plunder the country's wealth.",
      "Such investigations used to spark real-life protests. Now those viewers still inside Russia can only watch via VPN and most dare not post comments.",
      "\"You can get a criminal charge now, just for lifting a finger,\" Ksenia Fadeeva points out, although the latest film was seen almost two million times in 10 days.",
      "Ksenia is sure most of that audience is in Russia.",
      "\"People haven't changed their views, they're still there. They definitely read and follow and watch,\" she says. \"But they can't protest. They're just surviving.\"",

      "Others believe researchers do still have ways to take the social pulse, and they confirm that it's not set racing by Yulia Navalnaya and co.",
      "Navalny's widow has moral authority but nowhere near his political skills.",
      "\"All these\u2026 liberal figures have extremely low approval ratings,\" says academic Tatiana Stanovaya. Instead, she detects a consolidation of support for the Kremlin which she links to a surge in Ukrainian drone strikes on Russia.",
      "\"People see that we are very vulnerable and they have to choose the strongest player to rely on,\" the analyst explains. \"It's not because they like Putin or consider him a positive hero. It's because he can protect Russia in a very hostile environment.\"",
      "No matter that Putin created that environment himself by going to war.",
      "It helps that Donald Trump now appears to be siding with Moscow: the US president once said he \"understood\" Russia's veto on Ukraine joining Nato. He now seems to have conceded that major condition, even before any peace talks.",
      "\"I think the war has further entrenched anti-Western sentiment,\" Dr Jade McGlynn of King's College suggests. \"I also don't really see evidence there's even a strong minority of Russians who are desirous of a liberal, Western-allied type of democracy.\"",
      "\"I think the liberals\u2026 ultimately failed to convince.\"",
      "There's a whole lot wrapped up in that line, including the economic pain and massive corruption Russians experienced as the USSR fell apart. It all helped make democracy a dirty word.",
      "For years, state TV has also been shouting into every living room that critics of Russia are its enemies, and Western agents.",
      "\"The Kremlin plays on a real fear, ingrained in Russian minds, that the West has been trying to ruin Russia, weaken and divide it,\" Tatiana Stanovaya argues.",
      "\"There is good soil for the Kremlin to work on.\"",
      "Divided dissent",
      "Opposition forces are also deeply divided.",
      "Fierce rivalries and personality clashes that go back many years have intensified in exile and now frequently erupt into vicious and very public fights.",
      "\"We can debate after democracy in Russia begins, but for now we have the same goal and the same enemy: he's in the Kremlin,\" Anastasia Burakova voices the frustration of many that such scrapping is a dangerous distraction.",
      "That division is part of why Jade McGlynn thinks Russia's exiled activists might better be called \"dissidents\" than a political opposition.",
      "\"Politics is about practicality, otherwise you are a philosopher,\" she argues \u2013 and challenging those in power is impossible in Russia right now.",
      "Anastasia Shevchenko agrees. But just surviving Putinism isn't good enough for her. \"I hate when people still talk about the 'beautiful Russia of the future',\" the Russian activist quoted Alexei Navalny, when we met in a Kyiv coffee shop last month.",
      "\"You can't be happy next to destroyed cities where so many people were killed.\"",
      "Other opposition figures insist on referring to \"Putin's war\", to suggest that most Russians are against the invasion - which infuriates Ukrainians.",
      "\"I think to claim that it's one man's war when you have 600,000 troops there and over three million in the defence industry, not including all the propagandists, is not convincing,\" Jade McGlynn is firm.",
      "Other ways to help",
      "But Anastasia Shevchenko struggles to focus on anything else. Whilst change within Russia remains \"very far away\", she sees Ukraine is in trouble now and she can help.",
      "She's become a one-woman telephone exchange for Ukrainian soldiers held captive in Russia: prisoners of war, who can't call Ukrainian numbers from Russian jails, dial Anastasia's Russian mobile. She gets their mother or wife on another line and places the phones together so they can talk.",
      "\"If you can help Ukraine, you should do that,\" she believes. \"But we Russians are focused only on Russia and I don't understand it.\"",
      "Still readjusting to life out of prison, and out of her country, Ksenia Fadeeva has shifted her own focus from politics to human rights for now, helping political prisoners.",
      "\"I still believe Russia has every chance of becoming a normal, free, peaceful European country,\" Ksenia Fadeeva insists. \"But the regime is far harsher now, more authoritarian.\"",
      "Anastasia Shevchenko agrees, though she remembers the collapse of the USSR and concedes that history is unpredictable.",
      "\"You never know what happens. Things can change quickly. So you have to be ready.\"",
      "But ready for what?",
      "Spectre of nationalism",
      "The idea of Russia leaping from Putinism to liberal democracy looks less likely than ever.",
      "Jade McGlynn sees no prospect at all, unless the vision that led to the invasion of Ukraine - \"this imperial, chauvinist vision of Russia\" \u2013 is defeated.",
      "\"I think that's where we will see real opposition,\" she thinks. \"From disgruntled nationalists,\" especially in a country with tens of thousands of war veterans and all their trauma.",
      "\"What will the authorities 'sell' to the people then? What idea?,\" Ksenia Fadeeva wonders, when the war is finally over.",
      "All agree the political repression will remain intense. As the analyst Tatiana Stanovaya puts it: \"The state, especially the repressive apparatus, do not have the skills to retreat.\"",
      "On Sunday, Navalny's supporters plan memorials from Argentina to Australia to mark the anniversary of his death. In Moscow, some will visit his graveside. A few may dare to chant for change. But most of all, those who still cling to the dream of a democratic Russia will be checking who else is still out there. Still waiting.",

      "America's top diplomat, his senior officials and the travelling press returned to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington DC on Thursday night.",
      "But despite the mid-air scare the news was already firmly elsewhere. In Europe, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had stunned America's allies with a speech setting out what many saw as a series of concessions Ukraine would have to make to sign any peace deal with Russia brokered by President Trump.",
      "Hegseth said it was \"unrealistic\" to think Ukraine could win back its sovereign territory occupied by Russia, as was its demand for Nato membership, adding it was up to European and not US troops to keep the peace.",
      "Critics, including some Republicans in Washington, castigated the speech, saying it gave away all of Ukraine's leverage ahead of any negotiations. It was, they argued, a US capitulation to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

      "The following day, Hegseth wound back some of what he had said. He clarified that all options were in fact still on the table for Trump to use as leverage between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.",
      "\"What he decides to allow or not allow is at the purview of the leader of the free world, President Trump,\" said Hegseth. However he added he had been \"simply pointing out realism\" and rejected the idea he had offered any undue concessions to Moscow.",
      "As for Rubio, the broken-down plane delayed his arrival in Munich, where his officials were briefing about his own priorities for the trip.",
      "The United States would work for a \"just and lasting peace\" in which European countries would take the lead in creating a \"durable security framework\", they said.",
      "European leaders are expected to meet in Paris on Monday for urgent talks aimed at ensuring that their countries are fully involved in any Ukraine peace negotiations.",
      "The US secretary of state's position contained no trace of laying out limits for Ukraine in the way the defence secretary had done. Then, also in the German city, Vice-President JD Vance said the US could use \"military tools of leverage\" to compel Russia to do a deal, appearing to contradict Hegseth who had said no US troops would be deployed to Ukraine.",
      "Later in the Oval Office, the fallout from Hegseth's speech was put to President Trump - along with the commentary of a Republican senator who described it as a \"rookie mistake\", like something a pro-Putin pundit could have written.",
      "Had Trump been aware of what Hegseth was going to say? \"Generally speaking, yeah, generally speaking I was,\" said the president. \"I'll speak to Pete, I'll find out,\" he added.",
      "The three days of to and fro gave some of the first major insights into Trump's evolving position on one of the most consequential issues he faces - Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and his vow to end the war - and also into how his administration is formulating and messaging its foreign policy.",
      "On the substance, Hegseth's speech \u2013 alongside Trump's lengthy statement about an apparently warm phone call with Putin aimed at starting negotiations with Ukraine - sent shockwaves through European capitals, despite Hegseth's attempts to row back.",
      "\"Any quick fix is a dirty deal,\" said the European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas of the prospect of a US-led deal with Russia that might leave Ukraine's voice on the sidelines.",
      "Then there is the question of the way US foreign policy under Trump was being communicated. What happened in Munich seemed to be partly an attempt by his senior officials to interpret and relay Trump's positions, but that effort resulted in sometimes explosive and often contradictory statements - some of which were then partly diluted or reversed.",

      "JD Vance's blast at Europe ignores Ukraine and defence agenda",
      "Trump wants peace. Ukrainians fear what that might look like",
      "It is not yet clear how much this is the result of a new but ill-coordinated administration still clarifying its lines to take internally, as opposed to a deliberate feature of a presidency less concerned about officials freelancing with rhetoric, even if it sows some confusion, so long as they remain loyal to his final word.",
      "Trump's first term saw a series of high-profile sackings or resignations of top officials who contradicted or disagreed with him, including three national security advisers, two defence secretaries and a secretary of state.",
      "This time around, his appointments have been characterised more frequently by a willingness to show loyalty. Pete Hegseth, who had no previous experience running a military or government or agency, was a Fox News weekend presenter and former National Guard major who aligns strongly with Trump's thinking and agenda.",
      "His appointment was highly contested and scraped through its confirmation process with three Republican senators voting against him, seeing the result tied 50-50 with JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.",
      "As Trump said himself this week he was \"okay\" with the idea of taking Ukraine joining Nato off the negotiating table, calling it \"not practical\".",
      "Hegseth's comments were hardly out of line with the president's position - rather they were an amplification of it to an audience anxious to shore up Ukraine's negotiating position not weaken it.",
      "The challenge for those affected is that the precise position of US foreign policy is having to be divined. One of its features is uncertainty. This may well be deliberate - Donald Trump using the \"madman\" theory of foreign relations - often attributed to former Republican President Richard Nixon.",
      "This suggests that being powerful but unpredictable is a way to make allies stay close while coercing adversaries. It would also explain a sense of his own officials going rogue but within the parameters of Trump's broadly known positions.",
      "But as this theory's name suggests, it also carries considerable risks of mistakes or miscalculation in an already violent and uncertain world.",
      "Trump's recent proposals for Gaza \u2013 emptying it of its Palestinian population to build the \"Riviera of the Middle East\" under US ownership - were similarly permeated with confusion and contradiction.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 01:23:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Two of India\u2019s top visually impaired female athletes share the challenges of finding the perfect guide runner.",
    "story": [
      "\"When I was growing up, everyone in my village would say: 'She is blind, she is a waste',\" says Rakshitha Raju. Now, aged 24, she is one of India's top middle distance para athletes. \"It makes me so proud,\" she says.",
      "Rakshitha was born blind in a remote village in southern India and had lost both her parents by the age of 10. She was raised by her grandmother who is hearing and speech impaired.",
      "\"Both of us are disabled, so my grandma understood me,\" she says.",
      "When Rakshitha was about 13, the sports teacher at her school took her aside and told her she had the potential to be a great athlete.",
      "\"I wondered: 'How? I am blind, so how do I run on a track I can't see?'\" she recalls.",
      "Her teacher explained that visually impaired runners can have a guide, who runs alongside them. The athletes are joined by a tether - a short strap with a loop on both ends for each of them to hold on to.",
      "For a while, other pupils acted as guide runners for Rakshitha. Then in 2016, when she was 15, she competed in the National Games, where a man called Rahul Balakrishna spotted her.",
      "A middle-distance runner, Rahul had previously competed in the 1500m himself. He had been introduced to para athletics by a coach at the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) a few years earlier, while recovering from an injury.",
      "There was a shortage of guides and coaches and Rahul decided to take on both roles. The government pays him a salary for the coaching side of his work, but it does not pay guide runners.",
      "However, if a visually impaired runner wins an international competition, their guide also gets a medal - something Rahul had not achieved in his own running career. \"I felt proud that I could do this for myself and my country,\" he says.",
      "He invested his own time and money to support Rakshitha, helping her move to Bangalore in 2018 so she could have access to better training facilities.",
      "When they are running \"it's the small things that matter\", says Rahul. \"When they are approaching a curve, the guide has to alert the athlete or when a competitor is overtaking, he has to tell the athlete so they can put in a little more effort.\"",
      "Competition rules mean they can't hold hands - they can only be connected by the tether, and the guide-runner is not allowed to push, pull or otherwise propel the visually impaired athlete.",
      "Over time, the pair have built up a strong bond and now \"I believe in my guide runner more than myself\", says Rakshitha.",
      "They won gold medals at the 2018 and 2023 Asian Games, returning to a resounding welcome in Rakshitha's village. She smiles as she describes how the people who used to taunt her organised a procession for her, cheering and waving flags.",
      "Rakshitha became the first blind Indian woman to qualify for the 1500m in the Paralympics and she competed with Rahul in Paris in 2024.",
      "They missed out on a medal in France, but India's only other visually impaired female athlete to qualify for Paris, sprinter Simran Sharma, did make it to the podium, bringing home a bronze.",
      "Simran is partially sighted and when she started running, she ran alone.",
      "But in 2021, when Simran competed in the Tokyo Paralympics, she strayed out of her lane and realised that she would need a guide if she wanted to carry on running.",
      "But the search proved challenging. \"It can't be any athlete. You need someone whose technique matches yours and who runs as fast as you do,\" she explains.",
      "Simran finally spotted a young athlete called Abhay Kumar, who was training at the same place as her. The 18-year-old was between competitions and guiding Simran was an opportunity for him to get experience at international events.",
      "\"They sent me videos and after watching them I thought: 'I am a fast learner, this is going to be easy',\" he says. \"But when I ran for the first time, it turned out to be very difficult.\" Every movement has to be synchronised.",
      "Simran and Abhay did not have time to practice together for long before their first international competition - the 2024 World Para Athletics Championships in Japan - just a few weeks after they met.",
      "Their first race, the 100m, ended in disaster.",
      "\"Neither of us knew the rules properly,\" says Simran. Abhay \"thought he had to stop to let me cross the line first, so he stopped completely\". They were disqualified as he should have kept going and crossed the line just behind her.",
      "But by the time they got to the 200m race, they knew what they were doing and struck gold. Simran became the World Champion in the T12 category.",
      "Riding on that high, they went to the Paralympics in Paris. They came fourth in the 100m, but won bronze in the 200m race and Simran became the first Indian woman with a visual impairment to win a Paralympic medal.",
      "But Simran is worried how long Abhay will stay as her guide. He has his own career to think of too.",
      "Although guide runners get a medal when a pair wins, the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) says it cannot support guides with salaries, cash prizes or offer a long-term career path.",
      "\"All we can do is support short-term needs like their food, accommodation, transport and training facilities,\" says the PCI's national athletics coach Mr Satyanarayana, who goes by one name.",
      "Both Rakshitha and Simran now have sponsorship deals which help fund their training. They pay their guides themselves and give them a share of any prize money they win. But Rahul and Abhay would like more support from the state and want to be allowed to apply for public sector jobs reserved for sportsmen and women - like the athletes they work with.",
      "Despite the uncertainty around her future with Abhay, Simran is already looking ahead to the next Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. \"I won't rest till I change the colour of this medal,\" she says, hoping that next time she will win gold.",
      "Rakshitha is hoping for a medal next time too, with Rahul at her side. \"She must win a medal,\" he says. \"There are many like her in villages. They don't know about sports and the possibilities. Rakshitha would be a role model for them.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 02:48:15 GMT",
    "summary": "The population of the national bird is declining partly due to encroachment on wetlands by farmers.",
    "story": [
      "With its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms.",
      "All the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it.",
      "The bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; \u00a34m) for those found to have killed one.",
      "Going back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity.",
      "It was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died.",
      "\"Such stories instilled fear, and cranes would be respected and revered and not killed,\" Jimmy Muheebwa, a senior conservationist at Nature Uganda, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), told the BBC.",
      "But for farmers in western Uganda, where the cranes mostly hang out, that fear has dissipated and often it is only conservationists who appear to know about the ban on killing them.",
      "\"I really don't see any value in these birds because all they do is raid our plantations and eat our crops. We are worried about food security in this area,\" Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC.",
      "Another farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard.",
      "\"We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Also known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.",
      "They are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather.",
      "Standing at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates.",
      "But with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home.",
      "\"In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,\" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC.",
      "In the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda.",
      "This decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012.",
      "\"Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction,\" Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC.",
      "Around Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn.",
      "Conservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara.",
      "Dozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda.",
      "\"One of the biggest threats against cranes is poisoning by the farmers. This is because the birds are causing a lot of crop damage,\" Gilbert Tayebwa, a conservation officer at ICF, told BBC.",
      "Mr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes.",
      "Farmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides.",
      "\"I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed. But government should consider compensating farmers for crop damage,\" he told the BBC.",
      "However, John Makombo, director of conservation at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said this was not possible.",
      "\"It is one of those precious species that have freedom to go anywhere and so unfortunately the government is not liable for any damage done by the cranes,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Sarah Kugonza, an ICF conservationist, said the cranes also face a host of other threats - not just from farmers. Without the protective cover of the wetlands, their chicks are more likely to be captured by eagles.",
      "Cranes are finding day by day that they are living in an increasingly hostile environment.",
      "\"Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,\" Ms Kugonza told BBC.",
      "Their exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi.",
      "But crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful.",
      "\"It is a highly monogamous bird as it pairs once, for life. This means that if one of them is killed or domesticated, the likelihood of finding a new mating partner is almost zero,\" said Mr Muheebwa.",
      "They attract a mate by dancing, bowing and jumping - and are often seen walking as couples or families. A pair will define their own territory and can be very aggressive to defend it.",
      "Scientifically called Balearica regulorum gibbericeps, the cranes also have unique nesting patterns as they usually return to the same location annually, often laying between two and five eggs that are incubated by both sexes for anywhere between 28 and 31 days.",
      "Any destruction to these nesting areas impacts on these breeding patterns.",
      "Their monogamy has also attracted the unwelcome attention of local traditional healers, who claim that the parts of crested crane may bring faithfulness from a partner - or good luck.",
      "\"Some people have been caught hunting cranes to take some of their body parts to witch doctors in a belief that they will get rich. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you,\" Mr Tayebwa from ICF said.",
      "This is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes.",
      "And in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands.",
      "President Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation.",
      "The ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected.",
      "Nature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained \"very low\".",
      "For Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law.",
      "\"We shall arrest and prosecute those who are poisoning the cranes,\" he said.",

      "In Temptation Island, couples are taken to a tropical island, separated and sent to separate villas filled with attractive singles ready to test their loyalty. In a final twist, every move made is recorded for the other half to see.",
      "Forced to watch a graphic real-time stream of the betrayal, Montoya's emotions swell until he snaps, breaking all the show's rules.",
      "Blind to the now infamous pleas of host Sandra Barneda (\"Montoya, por favor!\"), he rampages down the beach to confront the pair, tugging at his shorts in anguish as lightning streaks across the sky.",
      "A second clip shows the resulting confrontation: Anita flips the script, calling out Montoya's own indiscretions before collapsing in tears, begging for forgiveness.",
      "\"This is cinema,\" wrote one X user, posting a clip that has now been watched on the platform a staggering 224 million times since 4 February.",
      "\"Montoya. The tension... you don't need to speak Spanish to understand, this is insane.\"",
      "Yet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the \"completely unexpected\" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability.",
      "\"In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,\" he says. \"I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked.",
      "\"Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask, what would I do in that situation?\"",
      "The magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. \"Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,\" he says.",
      "Gonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a \"special man\". At 31, he told casters he'd \"never experienced love like this before\", having been with Anita \"every day for a year\".",
      "\"She's a strong woman with a lot of character,\" Gonzalo adds.",
      "The Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's \"authentic emotion\" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked.",
      "Seeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea.",
      "\"It was refreshing and almost shocking to see something so raw, because it's something that we just don't see on the reality TV shows in Britain nowadays,\" Hulme says.",
      "\"We're at a point with reality TV culture where we're wondering 'what if' - are contestants really being their authentic self... or are they after followings and a brand deal?\"",
      "Alongside constructed storylines, the commercialised reality TV-to-influencer pipeline has made existing formats feel \"predictable\" adds Hulme.",
      "'Never allowed' on UK TV?",
      "A curious quirk of the Montoya phenomenon is that the Spanish show isn't available to watch in the UK - an irony that has only fuelled its illicit appeal on social media.",
      "A previous British version failed to take off, and production company Banijay says it does not presently plan to broadcast the Spanish version in the UK.",
      "After Montoya's meltdown caught the eye of Love Island host Maya Jama, she posted: \"They would never allow this on UK TV. For so many reasons. But it's one of the best things I've ever seen\".",
      "When asked why, she simply replied: \"people would complain\".",
      "Like Big Brother before it, Love Island has been the subject of complaints to Ofcom.",
      "A heated confrontation between 2021 Love Islanders Faye and Teddy over Teddy's behaviour in Casa Amor (a segment similar to Temptation Island's premise) sparked 25,000 Ofcom complaints.",
      "Despite the shocked reactions Gonzalo's show has provoked, he says it operates within strict boundaries, suitable for its primetime slot.",
      "\"Not everything we record is aired,\" he says. \"We are very careful - we only show a few seconds of sexual content.\"",
      "Temptation Island is just the latest in a string of particularly high-octane Spanish dating shows.",
      "Take Falso Amor (or Deep Fake Love) is another. Currently streaming on Netflix, it intensifies the premise of Temptation Island by asking couples to decide whether videos of each other are real or highly convincing AI deepfakes.",
      "So is content which British audiences find shocking viewed differently in Spain?",
      "When I raise Love Island's Zara Holland being stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after having sex on the show in 2016, Gonzalo is shocked and welcomes the internet's more light-hearted reaction to Anita's sexual scenes.",
      "\"As in other countries, things in Spain are progressing from the past - this is positive for our view of women and sexuality,\" he says, adding that no gender should face double standards.",
      "Montoya 'given the right help'",
      "In the UK, there has been heightened scrutiny and awareness of the impact reality TV can have on cast members' mental health, following the deaths of several former contestants.",
      "When I press Gonzalo on this, given the intensity of Montoya and Anita's experience, he says a team of psychologists monitor contestants before, during and after filming.",
      "Montoya received particular support after his beach escapade.",
      "\"We made sure he was not alone, that he had a safe space to process everything. It was important for us to provide him with the right help,\" he says.",
      "Looking ahead, Netflix is to relaunch a US version of the show next month.",
      "Gonzalo is up for the fight. He laughs at the internet's playful suggestion that the beach scene should win an Oscar, then adds: \"My team deserve all the awards!\""

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 11:37:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor, who received his fourth Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the legendary folk singer, talks about cultivating authenticity in his performances.",
    "story": [
      "The fires that ravaged Southern California last month turned too many of Malibu's most treasured places to ash. But some, like the legendary Shangri-La Studios, still stand. Over the years, Shangri-La has been used by some of the biggest names in the music business, like Eric Clapton and Adele. But it's also known as the house that Bob Dylan built. Even the old bus out back, legend has it, was used by Dylan on tour.",
      "Dylan even camped out on the lawn. \"I actually think it's in Clapton's biography that there was a period where Dylan had a tent in the rose garden here,\" said actor Edward Norton.",
      "For him, this is hallowed ground \u2013 and in a way, so is his latest movie role. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Norton is folk music legend Pete Seeger, playing opposite Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the young Bob Dylan.",
      "Norton says playing a music legend like Seeger was both sublime, and terrifying. \"I think every actor, some part of 'em wants to be a rock star, you know?\" he said. \"I think every actor holds the dream in some sense. I mean, I almost started crying at the idea of it, because, well, I was nervous about it. I was nervous about the whole enterprise. Because I thought the idea of a biopic about Dylan \u2013 if you just said it that way, I was, like, Oooh, like, I'm not sure. 'Cause to me, it has a mythical kind of place in me, and I thought, this could be really, really a bad idea.\"",
      "And here's just one of the challenges: Pete Seeger was an accomplished banjo player, so Norton had to become one as well, and the banjo's a tough one to learn.",
      "I said, \"We did an interview with Steve Martin, and he played the banjo for us, and watching him play the banjo, I mean, it's so complex and it's so fast.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I made the joke that I googled, you know, 'Is there an AI that can replace my hands with Steve Martin's?'\" Norton laughed. \"Or, you know, that thing where you put your arms behind your back and Steve Martin puts his hands under my armpits and does the playing for me? Which I'm not saying is not what happened, you know? It might have. Who knows?\"",
      "In the finished film, his playing looks and sounds authentic, because it is:",
      "That authenticity is something that Norton has always worked for, starting with his very first movie role, as a calculating killer in the 1996 thriller \"Primal Fear.\" Norton, who was raised in Maryland, cultivated an Appalachian accent so real that people thought he was actually from Kentucky, and he wound up with his first Oscar nomination. Three years later he was fighting it out with Brad Pitt in \"Fight Club,\" a film that has now become embedded in our culture.",
      "And although it has a huge following now, it was not successful when it was released. \"No, not at all,\" Norton said. \"And it was polarizing. I would say, there were those who absolutely, like, it hit them right in the center of their sense of their own selves. And then there were people who just absolutely thought it was garbage \u2013 panned it.\"",
      "In fact, it was roundly booed at the Venice Film Festival. But that didn't bother Norton, or his co-star Pitt. \"As the credits rolled, Brad looked at me in the dark crying, and he said, 'That's the best film we'll ever be in.' And I said, 'Me, too, and I think so, too.' And we were hugging each other and crying because we were so happy with, like, boos rising around us, you know what I mean? I think sometimes you just gotta, you know, let your own freak flag fly, and people will figure it out, or not.\"",
      "Norton has let his own freak flag fly in more than 40 films, like a mild-mannered police captain in \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" He was an ego-driven Broadway actor in \"Birdman\"; and he nailed the eccentric billionaire part in \"Glass Onion.\"",
      "Watching him on-screen, it's hard to believe Norton was once told he didn't have what it takes to make it as an actor. There was once a casting director who told him, \"Find another profession.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I had one of those, like, someone sits you down and says, 'You should do something else,'\" he said. \"Very, very, very well-known casting director in New York. One of the ones you hoped to get in front of. But look, if you don't run into moments where people lay some fundamental uncertainty around you [about] the path you've chosen, and you can't push through it, then you probably don't belong.\"",
      "There's little doubt he belongs in all of this: Norton has an Oscar nomination for every decade of his career, and he's in the running now for his work in \"A Complete Unknown.\" But he says that, for him, it's not about the awards or the money, but the chance to channel greatness.",
      "He said, \"If channeling their frequency gets people refocused on what it looked like when people were using the talents they had to further ideas and values that were bigger than themselves, then that is what makes it worth doing. Can we get people to re-engage with and be moved by and inspired by the idea of artists as agents of change?\"",
      "And whether Edward Norton is a pure artist, or just a really great actor, it's easy to believe him.",

      "\"Lorne: The Man Who Invented Saturday Night Live,\"\u00a0by New Yorker articles editor Susan Morrison (to be published February 18 by Random House), is a biography of late-night comedy producer Lorne Michaels, who has guided \"Saturday Night Live\" for most of its 50 years. But it is also the history of a pop culture institution that has introduced phenomenal comic talents, rewritten the rules of live television, and captured or challenged the zeitgeist for a half-century.",

      "Prologue",
      "Every week at Saturday Night Live is just like every other week. Every week is the same because it's always intense, fueled by insanely hard work, full of triumphs and failures and backstage explosions, and because it's built around a guest host\u2014Jennifer Lopez or Lizzo or Elon Musk\u2014who often has no idea what they are doing. It has been Lorne Michaels's job for the last fifty years to make it seem as if they do, and to corral the egos and the talents on his staff into getting the show on the air, live. Since he created the show, in 1975, he has periodically tweaked and fine-tuned it, paying attention to how the cultural winds are drifting. But the formula has essentially remained the same. Michaels compares it to a Snickers bar: viewers expect a certain amount of peanuts, a certain amount of caramel, and a certain amount of chocolate. (\"There's a comfort level,\" he says.) The show has good years and bad years, like the New York Yankees, or the Dow, and the audience has come to feel something like ownership of it. Just about every person who has ever watched SNL believes that its funniest years were the ones when they were in high school. Michaels likes to say that everyone in the entertainment business has two jobs: their actual job and figuring out how to fix SNL. (When J. D. Salinger died, in 2010, letters surfaced in which even he griped about what was wrong with the show.)",
      "The show's cast members and writers have speculated for years about the secret behind Michaels's extraordinary tenure. \"It's him and Hitchcock,\" John Mulaney says. \"No one else has had this kind of longevity.\" Half of them believe that Michaels has repeatedly been able to remake the show for a new audience because he's a once-in-a-lifetime talent, a producer nonpareil. The other half wonders whether Michaels, gnomic and almost comically elusive, is a blank screen onto which they've all projected a lifetime of hopes and fears and dark jokes; whether he, like the cramped stages in SNL's Studio 8H, is just a backdrop for the ever-shifting brilliance of the country's best comic minds.",

    "title": "Looking back at 50 years of \"Saturday Night Live\"",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:14:56 -0500",
    "summary": "On October 11, 1975, people tuning into the debut of a late-night comedy show saw something unlike any TV variety extravaganza they'd ever seen. Today, \"Saturday Night Live,\" produced by Lorne Michaels, is now an entrenched part of pop culture.",
    "story": [
      "On Saturday night, October 11, 1975, television viewers tuned in for a comedy variety show that looked nothing like they were used to. \"It's a sketch, a very unusual sketch, kind of in a minor key, [with] John Belushi as a kind of rumpled guy with a grocery sack,\" said writer Susan Morrison. \"He's supposed to be an immigrant trying to learn English.\"",
      "Instructor (Michael O'Donoghue): \"I would like\u2026\"Belushi: \"I would like\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Belushi: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"Belushi: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"",
      "When the instructor succumbs to a heart attack and falls to the floor, Belushi mimics him. \"It's about death,\" Morrison laughed. \"And that was something that variety shows did not traffic in in 1975!\"",
      "Morrison is the author of \"Lorne\" (that would be Lorne Michaels, the man behind \"Saturday Night Live\"). For 50 years now, \"Saturday Night Live\" has been putting on a 90-minute mix of live comedy sketches, beloved commercial parodies, and musical acts, each episode headlined by a celebrity host.",
      "So, what did variety shows look like before SNL? \"They took place on a big, wide stage; it was very shiny, very blank,\" said Morrison. \"And the content of these variety shows also was kind of a throwback \u2013 very hammy, almost vaudevillian, kind of Catskill comics doing seltzer-in-the-pants bits.\"",
      "Michaels worked on several of those shows, including \"Laugh-In.\" Morrison said, \"'Laugh-In' was really the first variety show that seemed to care about youth culture and being hip. But politically, that show was relatively toothless. What passed for political humor on 'Laugh-In' was Goldie Hawn doing kind of a dumb blonde bit.\"",
      "Michaels learned a different lesson working on a cornball comedy show hosted by Phyllis Diller.\u00a0 Its premiere episode in 1968 went up against a Barbra Streisand special. \"Streisand was the hottest thing out there,\" said Morrison. \"'Funny Girl' was about to come out. And Lorne thought, 'Oh my God, we're dead. Everybody's gonna watch Streisand.' But as it turned out, the Diller show beat Streisand in the ratings by a mile.",
      "\"And Lorne recognized, I think he said, 'You know, I realized there are two audiences. You know, there's the people I know, and then there's the wider American audience.' And to this day, he's always telling his young writers and performers, 'We have audience in all 50 states. We have to remember this is broadcast. It takes in the whole country.'\"",
      "Keeping all this in mind, Michaels set about creating a show for his own generation. As it happened, NBC's then-president was thinking along the same lines. And while it's fun to knock network executives, one of the revelations in \"Lorne\" is the role that Herb Schlosser played.",
      "\"He was a visionary president of NBC who was looking to fill a hole on Saturday night, when the network had been running Johnny Carson reruns,\" said Morrison. \"And he dictated a memo that pretty much hit all the points of what SNL was to be. He wanted to do a show out of Studio 8H at 30 Rock, which had basically been dormant, you know, since the '50s. He wanted it to be live. He wanted it to be on at 11:30 Saturday night. He wanted it to have rotating hosts.\"",
      "Before Michaels even hired his cast, he hired the writers, among them, Alan Zweibel. \"If you look at those early days of SNL, the logo for the show was 'Saturday Night Live' spray-painted on the outside wall of what was then called the RCA Building,\" he said. \"It was like graffiti. And I thought it spoke volumes. Here these kids came along besmirching whatever the standard was, whatever the establishment was.\"",
      "Zweibel had been working in a deli when he got the gig: \"I gave him a book with my jokes in it. The first joke that I put, saying that the post office is about to issue a stamp commemorating prostitution in the United States. 'It's a 10-cent stamp. But if you want to lick it, it's a quarter.' And they laughed, and it was great. I was now a professional comedy writer.\"",
      "The writers were young, and the cast were unknowns. Morrison said, \"He really wanted the show to feel like it was speaking in the voice of everybody's funny, sarcastic friend, you know, grousing, wisecracking, just the way people are when they're trying to make their friends laugh.\"",
      "And over the past five decades, America has become friends with more than a hundred different cast members and the characters they've created, not to mention all those catchphrases that have seeped into our conversation, like \"Well, isn't that special,\" or \"I gotta have more cowbell.\"",
      "The writers and actors know that the best way to make the audience laugh is to make each other laugh.",
      "Rachel Dratch was on the show from 1999 to 2006. She and longtime writer Paula Pell created Debbie Downer \u2013 that friend we all have who always manages to bring the party down.",
      "Dratch recalled, \"I think it was Paula said, like, 'Let's set it somewhere really happy. So, let's put it at Disney World.' And then it started to flow. And then as we were writing we were making each other laugh a lot, but then we started going, like, wah-wah. Like, just to each other. I think it was Paula who said, like, 'What if we just put the trombone in the scene?'\"",
      "Pell said, \"And then we did it for that first time, and it was where everyone lost their minds laughing on \u2013 they were wiping their eyes with waffles. And I remember being in a dressing room watching it on the thing, and just tears coming down my d\u00e9colletage and laughing so ungodly hard. It was such a lightning-in-a-bottle moment at that show where you're, like, I will never forget this five minutes ever in my life!\"",
      "For material, the staff is encouraged to draw from their own lives. \"I was always, always wanting to be a cheerleader,\" said Pell. \"And every year, every summer, I worked on my back handsprings. I was a little chubby girl. I was very strong. I was nice and loud. I was really good at cheerleading. And every year, I didn't get it.\"",
      "So, Pell collaborated with Cheri Oteri and Will Ferrell on their Spartan cheerleaders sketch:",
      "\"So, the Spartan cheerleaders, that comes from a real place?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it comes from the place of, like, joyful loser existence,\" said Pell. \"You go, 'Oh, I didn't make it. Let's go cheer anyway. We're gonna get costumes. Let's go cheer for things nobody is gonna kick us out on,' and they still get to be dramatic cheerleaders.\"",
      "Over the run of the show, the tone of SNL has shifted away from gritty and dark, towards colorful and more, well, cheerful. Morrison writes that Lorne Michaels began directing his staff to \"do it in sunshine.\" She explained: \"Do it in sunshine means first of all, everyone should look pretty good, you know? You want the costumes to be flattering, the colors to be bright. You don't want anger. He very often counsels writers to avoid writing anger. People don't put on a television to see people yelling at each other. Fred Armisen told me that Lorne said once, 'There's enough misery in the world. People huddle around the television as if they're huddling around a fire.'\"",
      "Armisen played Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi. \"I try to keep it, you know, even with the dictators I've played, I've even approached them with \u2013 I can't believe I'm saying this \u2013 like, love and kindness. So, for Qaddafi I'm like, 'I'm gonna love this character. Whoever this guy is, I'm gonna love him and just imagine him as an eccentric at his very worst.'\"",
      "Armisen spent 12 seasons on \"Saturday Night Live.\" To hear him tell it, it wasn't nearly enough. \"I loved it. It was just the best existence,\" he said. \"If you're sitting out three sketches in a row and you're like, 'Oh, I'm not in these,' it is awesome to watch your castmates put something together and see that magic happen. It's fantastic.\"",

    "title": "David Macaulay, America's \"Explainer-in-chief\"",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:26:15 -0500",
    "summary": "The author has spent more than 50 years finding ways to explain things, via his humorous and intricately illustrated books featuring wooly mammoth guides \u2013 his attempt to hook young readers on the wonders right before their eyes.",
    "story": [
      "Confession: I'm just mad about the mammoth, the one that wandered out of the Ice Age into one of author-illustrator David Macaulay's books \u2013 where he found his purpose in life (if that's a mammoth thing) helping Macaulay explain the way things work to kids.",
      "\"I was desperate to find a humorous way of explaining levers,\" said Macaulay, who realized levers have probably been around for a long time. \"So, I put the mammoth on the end of the log, and put the log on the rock to have a fulcrum, and the villagers on this end of the lever. The problem that had to be solved was, what does the mammoth weigh? So, it's as simple as that!\"",
      "Since it came out in 1988, \"The Way Things Work\" has sold more than a million copies around the world. Mammoth (and a whole herd of his friends) have made their way into other Macaulay books as well.",
      "Asked how many mammoths he thinks he's drawn, Macaulay replied, \"It's like 43,272, I believe. That's just a guess.\"",
      "With or without the help of mammoths, but always with a sense of humor, Macaulay has come to be known as \"America's Explainer-in-chief.\" He is a multi-award-winning star in the children's picture book world and a Macarthur \"genius grant\" recipient, having explained all kinds of things in more than two dozen books over the course of his 50+ year career: the human body \u2026 cathedrals \u2026 castles \u2026 toilets \u2026 the pyramids \u2026 ships \u2026 the city of Rome.",
      "\"I miss Rome,\" he said. \"I think about it often, and I think about particular streets and places in Rome.\"",
      "As an architecture student at the Rhode Island School of Design, Macaulay spent a year there. Born in England, he moved to the United States at the age of ten with his family.",
      "An ongoing exhibit at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., explores the messiness of creating a book. It is toplined, literally, as chaos: \"Chaos, that's where this process started, and in fact it's where all my books start,\" he said. \"This whole thing [depicts] the inside of my brain, and those clouds floating overhead were an attempt to sort of suggest some of that, you know, the things that go through your mind when you think, This is not going to work.\"",
      "\"Some of these look like procrastination,\" I said.",
      "\"Oh, procrastination is my gift,\" said Macaulay. \"I always find that in the end, if I'm using my imagination, if I'm asking the right questions, then the procrastination is working in my favor. I just have to keep drawing.\"",
      "And drawing \u2026 and drawing. The exhibits features just some of the drawings he produced while he was figuring out who would be the ideal tour guide of Rome with the perfect point of view. \"Why not a pigeon carrying a message from somebody who lives outside the city to someone who lives inside the city? And it took the scenic route, which was ideal.\"",
      "Early one fall morning, Macaulay brought us to the Ledyard Bridge. On one aside, Vermont; over there, New Hampshire, the Connecticut River in-between. He began sketching the bridge: \"The weight of all of this is supported on this arch, and transferred into these piers,\" he said.",
      "He wanted us to realize that, for him, sketching is seeing. Sketching is a language for understanding. \"We look at things, but do we actually see them?\" he said. \"What better way to spend time with a structure like this than with a sketchbook in your hand, looking at specific details? I think that's my goal in a way, is to have people open their eyes to the ordinary, to the everyday, to the things they take for granted.\"",
      "Like the sorts of things, both man-made and natural, that Macaulay sees when he walks his dogs, Maya and Minnow, in Norwich, Vt., where he lives.",
      "His storyboard details the objects that hold his fascination: \"Once she's stopped and I'm holding the leash, I think, 'I wonder how many pieces of wood are in that fence? Wonder how it's fastened together?'\"",
      "Walks with Stella, his beloved previous dog, are the basis for the book he's working on now. What's starting to take shape on his wall is David Macaulay's stealth attempt to hook kids on the wonder right before their eyes.\u00a0 \"I thought maybe I can create a book that will help them connect,\" he said. \"What better way to do that than to maybe use myself as an example?\"",
      "It's the first time his work has ever been this personal and introspective. At 78, this time, the point of view is his own.",
      "But why? And why now? \"My sort of conscience, perhaps a little bit, a little payback here after all these years of being able to do what I want, really, and be successful at it, be rewarded for it,\" he said. \"It's time to maybe pay that off.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 15:18:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The new Frosty flavor will be available at Wendy's locations beginning in late February.",
    "story": [
      "Wendy's Frosty's is a beloved treat \u2014 and a new addition to the lineup will combine the familiar frozen dairy dessert with a beloved Girl Scout cookie.",
      "Frosty's have been a staple of the Wendy's menu since the late 1960s when founder Dave Thomas decided to add a frozen treat to it. The drink has only grown in popularity. Last year, the chain served 500 per minute in the United States. The Frosty falls somewhere between soft serve and hard-packed ice cream, creating a frozen creamy treat that's stood the test of time.",
      "For decades, just one flavor \u2014 chocolate \u2014 was available. In 2006, vanilla joined the lineup. In 2022, the fast-food chain started trying new limited-edition flavors.",
      "On Feb. 21, the fast food chain will start selling Thin Mint-flavored Frostys. Fans are excited about the idea, which will combine the smooth Frosty with the mint-chocolate-chip flavors of a Thin Mint, but designing the treat was harder than people may think.",
      "The cookie didn't lend itself to a frozen treat, so the recipe had to be tweaked, according to John Li, Wendy's Vice President of Research and Development. Instead of frozen pieces or chunks of cookie, Li and his team wound up developing a fudge-like cookie butter that can be swirled into a Frosty.",
      "The cookie butter adds the flavor of a Thin Mint but makes it possible for customers to still get their Frosty quickly. The way it's swirled into the frozen treat ensures that customers get a taste of Thin Mint in every sip or bite. The swirl can be added to either chocolate or vanilla Frosty's. Li said they initially thought about only offering one flavor, but decided that the swirl worked well in both.",
      "\"You can't get more nostalgic than a Wendy Frosty and the Girls Scouts,\" said Li. \"The fact that they're coming together really pulls at the heartstrings of food lovers in this country.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"Morgiane\" is believed to be the oldest existing opera written by a Black American -- but despite its historic significance, the show was only performed for audiences for the first time in 2025.",
      "\"Morgiane\" was the magnum opus of New Orleans-born composer Edmond Dede. The opera, based on themes from \"Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves,\" tells the story of a mother, Morgaine, and her daughter, Amine, who fight a tyrannical ruling sultan. Behind the curtain is Dede's remarkable story.",
      "Dede was born a free Black man in New Orleans in 1827. He was educated and moved to France in 1855, leaving just before the Civil War. In France, he studied music at the Paris Conservatoire and performed at Bordeaux's Grand Theatre. He also traveled to Algeria, then a French colony, and was inspired by the struggle of the people there.",
      "Dede returned to the U.S. once, during the height of the Jim Crow era. He was not permitted to perform in theaters, and went back to Europe, vowing that he would never return to his home country.",
      "Dede went on to write 250 songs, ballets and orchestral pieces. The 545-page \"Morgaine\" was his magnum opus, but it was never performed during his lifetime.",
      "In 2014, New Orleans Opera Creole founders Givonna Joseph and Aria Mason found a digital copy of \"Morgaine.\" Opera Creole shares music by composers of African descent, and when they found the piece, they knew they needed to bring it to an audience.",
      "\"I had, you know how you get, a gut feeling that this was important,\" Joseph said. \"I didn't know exactly how.\"",
      "Patrick Quigley, the artistic director designate of Washington, D.C.'s Opera Lafayette, was eager to join the mission. He and Joseph connected in 2023, and they began working with musicians and historians from across the country to bring the never-performed opera to life. First, they transcribed almost 6,000 measures of music into modern notation. When the process was done, they heard music that hadn't been played in over a century.",
      "\"It's this fabulous combination of so many different styles of music, both European and American all together in one place,\" Quigley said.",
      "Excerpts from \"Morgaine\" were played at New Orleans' St. Louis Cathedral on January 24. The church was likely the site of Dede's baptism. The entire opera was performed at Opera Lafayette for the first time on Feb. 3.",
      "\"It was an incredible moment for Washington, D.C., and it was an incredible moment for American music,\" said Quigley, who conducted the performance.",
      "There were also two other performances, one in New York City and one in College Park, Maryland. The brief tour served as a kind of homecoming for Dede, said Joseph.",

      "They married in 2011, but it wasn't until three years later that they started singing together.",
      "Their path to success wasn't easy as they faced challenges both in their personal lives and careers. Michael, a U.S. Army veteran who saw combat in Iraq, struggled with PTSD, while Tanya battled depression and suicide attempts.",

      "Their unique blend of country, R&B, and gospel influences helped them find their place in the music world. Michael credits the blues as a guiding force, drawing inspiration from legends like James Brown and Ray Charles.",
      "\"This is where the War and Treaty should exist,\" Michael said, reflecting on their musical journey.",
      "They struggled to find a home in R&B or gospel, but said\u00a0the country music world embraced them. They toured with Chris Stapleton and sang with the Brothers Osborne on the CMA Awards.",

      "Probationary workers across multiple federal health agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services received virtually identical letters Saturday evening informing them they would be terminated from their positions, sources told CBS News.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs, and your performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the Agency,\" read the letter obtained by CBS News.",

      "\"The individual had respiratory symptoms. He was previously hospitalized and has since been released,\" a spokesperson for Ohio's health department told CBS News in an email Saturday.",

      "The vast majority of human cases have been blamed on direct, often intensive exposure to sick cows or birds.",
      "Data reported so far by the CDC from testing labs suggests that this winter's record surge of influenza is being driven by seasonal strains of the virus, not human-to-human spread of a bird flu strain.",
      "However, investigations of a handful of human bird flu cases in the U.S. have so far not been able to identify a source of how they may have gotten sick.",
      "The first U.S. bird flu hospitalization was reported last year in Missouri, though health officials think the patient tested positive while hospitalized for other reasons, not bird flu. A second hospitalization was later reported in Louisiana, in a patient who died from the virus.",
      "Which bird flu strain sickened the new cases?",
      "It is unclear which strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus caused the Ohio and Wyoming cases. Answering that question has been a focus of experts and health officials for previous cases, as they track the evolution of the virus.",

      "A spokesperson for Ohio's health department said that information was not immediately available.

      "U.S. District Judge John Bates agreed to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the group Doctors for America, which argued that its members used the websites when treating patients and conducting research. The nonprofit organization said that the removal of the webpages by the Department of Health and Human Services and its components violated federal law.",
      "Bates found that the challengers were likely to succeed in their claims that the Department Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA acted unlawfully when they stripped medical information from public-facing websites.",
      "\"It bears emphasizing who ultimately bears the harm of defendants' actions: everyday Americans, and most acutely, underprivileged Americans, seeking healthcare,\" he wrote. Citing declarations from two doctors filed in the case, Bates said if they \"cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health.\"",
      "His order directs the agencies to restore earlier versions of their websites by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. It comes after Bates held a hearing on the matter Monday.",
      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions.

That marks the most fatalities from the bacterial infection since a 2017 surge of the illness, which is also known as pertussis.",

      "At least 360 pertussis cases were reported nationwide in last week's update to the CDC's tally of infections. Cases are up 27% from the week before.",

      "\"People of all ages are at risk for getting pertussis (whooping cough). Everyone who is not up to date with whooping cough vaccination should get vaccinated,\" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a statement.",
      "Whooping cough can initially be difficult to separate from other cold-causing germs that surge over the colder months. Pertussis infections are called whooping cough because of the sound of severe coughing attacks, which can linger for weeks.",
      "Some people are at higher risk of life-threatening complications from whooping cough infections, including babies and people who are not up to date on their vaccines.",
      "Prince, the CDC spokesperson, said data on pertussis deaths for January 2025 was not available. Whooping cough deaths can take several weeks to be confirmed.",
      "A local health department earlier this month in Washington announced the first whooping cough death in the state since 2011. A 5-year-old had died in November 2024, but was only confirmed as a pertussis death by the CDC in recent weeks.",
      "The child had not completed the pertussis vaccine series, the Spokane Regional Health District said in a release, and also had \"other health factors that contributed\" to their death.",
      "\"This death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination, especially for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and young children,\" Dr. Francisco Velazquez, the county's health officer, said in a statement.",
      "Officials have warned for months that the U.S. was likely on track to see a major wave in whooping cough cases. While infections usually climb every three to five years, pertussis was among many germs that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Other changes have also driven up pertussis cases in recent years, including a change in 2020 intended to cut down on missed cases by epidemiologists and waning immunity from pertussis vaccines.",
      "\"We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment,\" said Dr. Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami.",
      "He said it had been many years since they had seen a major outbreak of pertussis infections, as opposed to \"little pockets of increases\" around their system.",
      "Mestre said older pertussis patients often come into the emergency room after facing a persistent cough that does not go away after a week or so. Younger babies come in to get evaluated sooner and are at higher risk.",
      "\"They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness,\" said Mestre.",
      "Caregivers are urged to get up to date on their vaccines because that can reduce the risk of passing on an infection to young children, Mestre said. Pregnant moms who get vaccinated also pass on immunity to their children, protecting them as soon as they are born.",
      "\"It's important that people understand that immunity wanes, even if you are vaccinated as a child. And if you are going to be around infants, we recommend vaccination every 10 years,\" he said.",

      "YouTube TV has reached a deal with Paramount to keep channels like CBS, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV days after failed negotiations for a new contract had briefly left the future of their streaming alliance in limbo.",
      "\"We're happy to share that we've reached a deal to continue carrying Paramount channels, including CBS, CBS Sports, Nickelodeon and more,\" YouTube announced in a statement Saturday night. \"With this agreement, YouTube TV will continue to offer 100+ channels and add-ons including Paramount+ with SHOWTIME and will enable more user choice in the future.\"",
      "The statement ended with a note to YouTube TV subscribers, whose \"patience\" the company praised as it \"negotiated on [their] behalf.\"",
      "YouTube, the online video platform owned by Google, launched its subscription-based arm for television streaming in 2017, partnering with broadcast and cable networks that gave YouTube TV access to their programs.",
      "Whether the company's prior agreement with Paramount, which allowed it to stream a broad range of channels under the network's umbrella, would hold up for another year was uncertain until Saturday, as a dispute over carriage fees halted talks for a contract renewal.",
      "Carriage fees are costs that paid TV providers, like YouTube, make to broadcasters, like Paramount, for the rights to carry that broadcaster's programming. Spats between providers and broadcasters have occurred with increasing frequency in recent years, at times causing disruptions for viewers.",
      "Paramount had accused YouTube TV of pressuring the network to agree to \"one-sided terms\" that favored the streamer, while YouTube said their team was \"working hard to reach a fair agreement with Paramount that allows us to keep their channels,\" in separate statements issued in the days leading up to the eventual deal.",
      "To avoid a lapse in programming access for subscribers as negotiations continued past their original deadline, YouTube TV announced a \"short-term extension\" for talks with Paramount on Thursday. That meant its customers could continue accessing Paramount channels despite the then-ongoing contract clash.",
      "YouTube TV has more than 8 million subscribers, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan\u00a0said\u00a0last year. The disagreement with Paramount trailed a price hike in January for YouTube TV,\u00a0 which increased the cost of its basic subscription package by $10 per month.",

      "About three-quarters of employees at an Amazon fulfillment center in Garner, a town located near Raleigh, voted against joining a grassroots labor organization called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, the National Labor Relations Board announced Saturday.",
      "The federal labor agency said 2,447 workers cast ballots against union representation while 829 voted in favor of joining the independent union, which is made up of former and current Amazon workers. The NLRB had said 4,300 Amazon workers were eligible to cast ballots in the election, which took place Monday through Saturday.",
      "Rev. Ryan Brown, a former Amazon worker who co-founded the group, said Saturday, \"We had already braced ourselves for a loss.\"",
      "\"We knew that historically the tide was against us to have a win for several reasons,\" Brown said. \"One, we're in the South. Two, the average worker that's in North Carolina knows nothing about a union and the benefits of a union and what a union could do for them.\"",
      "The outcome came just weeks after workers at a Whole Foods Market store in Pennsylvania voted to unionize, leading to the first successful entry of organized labor into the grocery chain, which Amazon owns. Following the union win, Whole Foods asked the NLRB to toss out the election results, arguing the voting process was tainted.",
      "In 2022, workers at an Amazon warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island unionized with Amazon Labor Union, which joined forces with the Teamsters last year. However, Amazon has objected to the election result and refused to negotiate over a contract.",
      "At the same time, the company has also been able to successfully fend off union victories at a second warehouse on Staten Island, as well as at facilities near Albany, New York, and in Bessemer, Alabama.",
      "In November, an NLRB administrative law judge ordered a third union election for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer after determining that the company committed six violations leading up to a rerun election in March 2022. That rerun was held after the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is seeking to represent Amazon workers in Bessemer, filed objections to the first election, which results in a union loss.",
      "Workers affiliated with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, or CAUSE, have been organizing at the North Carolina warehouse since January 2022.

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 08:48:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is firing thousands of federal workers on probationary status, or those without civil service protections.",
    "story": [
      "Probational federal employees who lost their jobs on Thursday as part of the Trump administration's mass\u00a0firing of government workers\u00a0expressed shock and anger at the terminations, which they contend will hurt the government's ability to provide services.",
      "President Trump is moving quickly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 saying he is slashing wasteful spending and pushing to make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's policies. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "Federal workers who received termination notices on Thursday described receiving nonpersonalized emails informing them they had been removed from their position, with little communication from their supervisors. The workers said they had entered public service because of a commitment to serve the public interest, whether by helping protect consumers from predatory financial services or by supporting veterans.",
      "\"We had all received these notices that cites probationary regulations and says we're being let go because 'you are not fit for continued employment because your ability and skills do not fit the agency's needs,'\" Elizabeth Aniskevich, an attorney with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS News.",
      "A termination letter provided to CBS News by a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs informed the worker that his job was ending because \"you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\"",
      "The VA worker, who had previously held federal jobs across different agencies for more than a decade, said he was dismayed to learn that he was considered a probationary worker after taking the Veterans Affairs job last fall, as it reset his government employment.",
      "\"Basically the gist [of the termination letter] is laying out I was a probationary employee, what my rights of appeal are, but my continued employment was no longer in the public interest,\" said the VA worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his chances of finding another government job. \"I came into the house \u2014 probably for a couple weeks my wife and I joked, 'Did I still have a job?' \u2014 I told her, and I lost it. It's devastating.\"",
      "Another VA employee, who told CBS News his work was rated as \"outstanding\" in his most recent performance review, said receiving an impersonal termination letter was hurtful.",
      "\"It feels like a copy/paste mass firing that takes nothing into account of the people, the human cost,\" said Greg House, 34, a disabled veteran who was terminated from his job at the VA's public affairs office in Salt Lake City, a job that he started in March 2024. He added, \"The idea that the federal workforce is too bloated feels like a scapegoat more than anything else. Nobody joins the federal government to get rich.\"",
      "The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed agencies to report their final numbers of fired probationary employees by 8 p.m Eastern time on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The White House press office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Unions claim firings are illegal",
      "Five unions for government employees have sued Mr. Trump and other officials in his administration over the firing of probationary workers, alleging the move is illegal because it violates procedures for making \"reductions in force,\" a formal process used by government agencies to dismiss employees.",
      "Reductions in force, or RIFs, can be made based on a number of issues, such as if there's not enough work or funding for federal workers, according to OPM.",
      "Mr. Trump's order \"directs agencies to promptly engage in RIFs for none of the specified, allowable reasons, but instead for the purpose of 'eliminating waste, bloat and insularity,'\" the lawsuit claims, citing the president's Feb. 11 executive order for widespread layoffs of government workers.",
      "Some experts are pushing back on the idea that the government workforce is too large, pointing out that federal employment has grown little since 1980. Prior to the firings, some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration.",
      "Impact on services",
      "The VA employee who was fired Thursday said he took exception to Mr. Trump's claim that the terminations would make the government more efficient, noting that his group, which had been trying to fill several empty positions, had more work than they could handle.",
      "\"We are under-resourced as it is, so cutting jobs won't do it,\" he said, adding that the firings will directly impact veterans. \"We have ongoing projects to try to construct and repair facilities to help veterans \u2014 we're already behind.\"",
      "A Food and Drug Administration employee \u2014 who also requested anonymity because she's in a probationary period in her job but hasn't received a termination letter \u2014 expressed concern that the firings would slow essential work, both because of the loss of skilled employees and a hit to employee morale.",
      "\"We're rather leanly staffed \u2014 the people on some of these teams have a tremendous workload,\" she said. \"It'll slow down things like drugs approvals ... it'll have a tremendous, terrible impact on access to drugs and generic drugs.\"",
      "Because many of the probationary workers are younger employees, the firings could add to long-term problems facing the federal workforce, where twice as many workers are over age 60 than under 30, said Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School.",
      "\"This will exacerbate the existing human capital crisis if probationary employees are more likely to be young, and more likely to have the skills that a 21st century government operation needs,\" she said.",
      "Where jobs are getting cut",
      "As of May 2024, the most recent data available, about 216,000 federal employees had been in their jobs for less than one year, according to government data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "The government agency with the most probationary employees is the VA, with about 56,000 workers bearing that designation, OPM data shows. The VA on Friday said it had fired more than 1,000 employees. The agency didn't respond to a request for comment about whether more firings could be coming.",
      "\"Make no mistake \u2014 Trump is looking to fire probationary employees because it is easy, not because it is good for veterans or cost-effective,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut who serves on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, told CBS News in a statement. \"In fact, it is a massive waste of taxpayer dollars to fire employees the department just invested months into recruiting, vetting and training.\"",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials expect most of the agency's roughly 5,200 probationary employees to be fired Friday, Feb. 14, under the Trump administration's move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees, according to an audio recording of a National Institutes of Health department meeting obtained by the Associated Press.",
      "In that meeting, an NIH office director told employees that some probationary staff with specialized skills might retain their positions. Probationary staff being terminated would receive an email Friday afternoon, the AP reported, citing the recording.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to\u00a0shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who hadn't yet gained civil service protection \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming.",
      "The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss it publicly.",
      "Even workers in the personnel office itself weren't immune: Dozens of probationary employees at OPM were told on a Thursday afternoon group call that they were being dismissed and then instructed to leave the building within a half-hour, according to another person who likewise spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "Elon Musk, to whom the president has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the elimination of whole agencies.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees representing federal workers, said the administration \"abused\" the probation status of workers \"to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office.\"",
      "Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are currently in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, as of March 2024, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job \u2014 the most recent data available.",
      "The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week and has included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education workers.",
      "At least 39 were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.",
      "The layoffs also hit Department of Veterans Affairs researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said Thursday.",
      "Murray said in a statement that she heard from VA researchers in her state who were told to stop their research immediately, \"not because their work isn't desperately needed, but because Trump and Elon have decided to fire these researchers on a whim.\"",
      "The VA announced Thursday that it had laid off more than 1,000 non-\"mission critical\" probationary workers and the move would \"save the department more than $98 million per year, and VA will redirect all of those resources back toward health care, benefits and services for VA beneficiaries.\"",
      "Half of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's Epidemic Intelligence Service officers \u2014 a group known as\u00a0the CDC's \"disease detectives\" \u2014 were among the cuts made Friday, multiple health officials tell CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration also moved Friday to fire more than 400 employees at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a group that defends government workers, said the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service would be hit especially hard by laying off probationary employees because it has trouble recruiting inspectors required to be present at all times at most slaughterhouses.",
      "The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington D.C. and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the Capitol region.",
      "Layoffs are unlikely to yield significant deficit savings. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the issue, it found the government spent $271 billion annually compensating civilian federal workers, with about 60% of that total going to workers employed by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.",
      "The government could, in theory, cut all those workers and still run a deficit of over $1 trillion that would continue to grow as tax revenues are needed to keep up with the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said firing employees on probation is flawed because it targets younger workers.",
      "\"Baby Boomers are retiring right and left, so actually the people you want to keep are probably most of the people who are right now on probation,\" said Kamarck, who worked in former President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government. \"They're younger and presumably have better skills, and that's who you want.\"",
      "Mr, Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a \"buyout,: which offered to pay people until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program Wednesday.",
      "However, the number of workers who took the offer was less than the administration's target, and Mr. Trump has made it clear he would take further steps.",
      "Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.",
      "The order the president signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring will be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.",

    "title": "Trump says the federal workforce is too big. Here's what to know.",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 09:14:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The federal government is the nation's largest employer, yet the size of its workforce hasn't kept up with U.S. population growth, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is moving swiftly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 a move that he has said will slash wasteful spending and make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's dictates.",
      "Mr. Trump has described the federal government as \"bloated\" and filled with \"people that are unnecessary.\" While the federal government has inefficiencies, as do all large and complex organizations, some experts are pointing out that the government workforce has grown little since 1980, and that some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration and the FAA's air traffic control centers.",
      "\"There's no indication that the government is particularly bloated in terms of numbers of federal workers \u2014 that number hasn't really changed over the past decades,\" Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The problem we were facing over the past decades isn't one of bloat, but of vacancies.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees\u00a0\u2014 who generally have less than a year on the job and who aren't yet covered by civil service protections \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "As Mr. Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency push to slash spending, here's what to know about the nation's federal workforce and the potential impact on Americans of scaling back government.",
      "What are Trump and Musk doing to shrink the federal workforce?",
      "Working with billionaire Elon Musk, Mr. Trump has offered a \"deferred resignation\" plan to more than 2 million federal employees, that would grant pay through the end of September while not working, in exchange for agreeing to step down. A federal judge on Tuesday cleared the program to proceed after it had been paused.",
      "About 75,000 workers have accepted the offer, and the Trump administration said that the deferred resignation program was closed as of 7 p.m. Feb. 12. The offer excludes members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security.",
      "In another move aimed at remaking the federal workforce, Mr. Trump this week also signed an executive order to reduce the number of government employees and limit hiring.",
      "The administration's order on Thursday to cut probationary workers is expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. According to federal data, there are about 220,000 federal workers with less than a year on the job, representing about 9% of the government workforce.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Is the federal workforce growing?",
      "As Mr. Trump and Musk charge ahead, some policy experts note that the federal workforce has decreased relative to the U.S. population when compared with earlier decades. The upshot: There are fewer government workers providing services to more U.S. residents than in prior years, according to new research from the Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "The federal workforce has waxed and waned over the years, but its size today puts it on the same footing as during the 1980s, when the U.S. population was about 220 million. Today, there are more than 330 million U.S. residents.",
      "How big is the federal workforce?",
      "The U.S. has more than 2.4 million federal workers, excluding those who work for the U.S. Postal Service, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (As a self-funded agency, the USPS relies on sales of stamps and other products and services to support its operations.)",
      "\"In absolute terms, the federal workforce is slightly smaller than it was 50 years ago, even though the U.S. population has increased by two-thirds during that time period,\" noted Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "In the 1940s, the federal workforce represented 4.5% of non-farm workers, a share that's dwindled to 1.5% today, according to CEPR's analysis.",
      "How efficient is the federal workforce?",
      "There's no overarching measure of the efficiency of the federal workforce, Linos of Harvard's Kennedy School noted. But agencies typically review their own operations to identify gaps that affect their ability to provide services.",
      "The federal workforce's efficiency should be measured on whether agencies are delivering the services they've been tasked to handle, she added. In recent years, many agencies have added data-driven measurements to determine whether they are providing those services to Americans.",
      "For instance, the Social Security Administration's most recent annual performance report identified long wait times for callers as a trouble spot, and added that it would like to shave the hold times to 12 minutes on average from its 34 minute on-hold time for fiscal year 2024. But that \"aspirational goal\" was being evaluated amid a hiring freeze, the report added.",
      "The Social Security Administration, which last year served a record 68 million beneficiaries, is working with its smallest staff in 50 years, former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley said in November congressional testimony.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. government suffers from various types of inefficiencies, with a 2024 U.S. Government Accountability Office\u00a0report\u00a0estimating that as much as $521 billion annually is lost to fraud, or about 8% of federal spending.",
      "Federal spending also has ballooned in recent years, although much of the increase is due to higher spending on Social Security and paying interest on federal debt,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "What agencies have the most federal workers?",
      "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has the most federal workers, with more than 487,000 employees, according to data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, or OPM. That's followed by the Department of Homeland Security, with more than 222,000 workers; and the U.S. Army, with 221,000 employees.",
      "Some of the agencies that have been targeted by Mr. Trump are relatively small by comparison. For instance, the president is considering an executive order to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, which has about 4,200 employees.",
      "Where are federal workers based geographically?",
      "Only about 7% of federal workers are located in Washington, D.C., proper, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report. But when adding the federal workers located in Virginia and Maryland, the larger Washington, D.C., metro area represents about 20% of the entire government workforce.",
      "Roughly 80% of federal workers are located outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, and civil service employees are employed in every U.S. state, the CRS report noted.",
      "While Washington, D.C., proper has the largest number of federal workers, at about 162,000, other states aren't far behind: California employs about 147,000 federal workers, while Texas has about 130,000.",
      "Additional states with sizable federal workforces include Florida, at about 94,000, and Georgia, with almost 80,000 federal workers, the analysis found.",
      "What does the typical federal worker earn?",
      "The average annual salary of federal workers tops $106,000, Pew Research Center found, citing OPM data.",
      "Federal salaries skew into the six figures because many civil service workers hold college or professional degrees, and are highly trained. The largest share of federal workers are employed in the medical field \u2014 physicians and nurses who work for the VA, for instance.",
      "Others are professionals such as accountants and attorneys who might be able to earn more if they worked for private employers. For instance, the Commodity Future Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts and other derivatives, pays its employees an average of $235,910. About 40% of its workforce is comprised of attorneys, Pew found.",
      "How could a much smaller federal workforce affect Americans?",
      "Services could degrade if enough federal workers are cut or resign, Harvard's Linos said. But Americans would still expect a certain level of service, such as getting their benefits paid on time or getting a passport on a timely basis.",
      "To address that issue, the federal government could turn to private-sector contractors to pick up the slack, she added. \"That's more costly \u2014 you end up paying a higher wage to private sector workers with less accountability,\" she noted.",
      "A hit to public services could heighten negative public sentiment about the federal government, Linos added. Public trust in the federal government has declined for decades, falling from about 77% of people in the 1960s who trust the government to do what is right to about 22% today, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\"We tell people the government is bloated, the day-to-day experience gets worse, and that feeds the narrative that the government is useless,\" she said.",

      "In an eleventh-hour agreement late Thursday night, YouTube TV reached what it called a \"short-term extension\" with Paramount to keep channels such as CBS, Comedy Central and MTV on its subscription streaming service after access to them was set to go dark following failed negotiations around a contract renewal.",

      "\"Paramount has a long track record of successfully and amicably renewing partnerships with every major distributor, including several in recent months, and we will continue our efforts to reach a new agreement with YouTube TV,\" a spokesperson for Paramount stated prior to the announcement of the short-term deal.",
      "\"YouTube TV is attempting to pressure Paramount to agree to one-sided terms, and these non-market demands may lead to an avoidable loss of Paramount's networks on YouTube TV, in addition to the removal of Paramount+ and BET+ from YouTube's Primetime Channels, on February 13,\" the spokesperson added.",

    "summary": "America's trading partners keep their markets to closed to U.S. exports, White House says in ordering up plan to impose global tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum directing his administration to weigh reciprocal tariffs, threatening to impose levies on U.S. imports from nations that put higher duties on American products.",
      "\"I've decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office at a proclamation signing. \"It's fair to all. No other country can complain.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its tariff policies would level the competitive playing field for U.S. and foreign manufacturers, although the new taxes would probably be shouldered by U.S. shoppers and businesses either directly or indirectly.",
      "Tariffs, which act as a tax on foreign goods, could lead to higher prices, which are rarely if every welcomed by Americans, and having more import duties on the horizon comes against a backdrop of inflation flaring up once again. Consumer prices in January\u00a0accelerated\u00a0to 3% on an annual basis, signaling the Federal Federal's push to drive inflation down to a 2% annual rate has petered out, at least for now.",
      "Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note earlier this week that proceeding with reciprocal U.S. tariffs poses \"additional upside risks to the inflation outlook.\"",
      "Trade negotiations",
      "The tariff hikes would vary for affected countries, with a goal of starting new trade negotiations, the Associated Press reported. A senior White House official who spoke to the wire service on condition of anonymity said the reviews required to move forward with the tariffs could be finished within a number of weeks, although the process could take longer.",
      "The plan \"will seek to correct long-standing imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board,\" the White House said in a statement about the tariffs. \"Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security,\" it proclaimed.",
      "The announcement came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by U.S. tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",
      "President Trump has placed an additional tariff on Chinese imports for what he says is that nation's role in producing opioid fentanyl. He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico that could take effect next month, after being paused 30 days. Mr. Trump also this week announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that are scheduled to take effect in March.",
      "Applying a matching tariff against select U.S. trading partners is likely an alternative to imposing a more sweeping levy, according to economists. Argentina, Brazil, India and Turkey have the biggest gaps in tariffs with the U.S., trade data shows.",
      "\"While most developed markets would come out relatively unscathed, emerging markets would suffer a greater loss of competitiveness, with India, Brazil and Turkey looking among the most exposed,\" Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report. \"It is probable that their governments (among others) would provide concessions to President Trump in an attempt to prevent reciprocal tariffs from being imposed.\"",

      "Indeed, as many as 3 in 4 U.S. homeowners could be underinsured, reports CBS News national consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi. That means more Americans should get to know their insurance policies, said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the nonprofit After the Fire USA.",
      "\"Well, the first thing you have to do is actually read your policy, and most of us don't do that, and so really encourage you to either sit down with somebody who is an expert in insurance \u2014 your underwriter [the insurance company] will be able to do this with you,\" Thompson told Quraishi.",
      "How much coverage do I need?",
      "Determining how much insurance you have, versus what you need to rebuild your a home in case of a disaster, is relatively straighforward. Start by taking the dollar amount of your policy coverage limit and dividing that by the square footage of your house or apartment.",

      "\"Do go to your underwriter and ask,\" Thompson said. \"Max out on your insurance \u2014 it does cost us a little bit more every single month, but it's just incredibly important. Some people won't call because they're afraid of being dropped. Do not do that.\"",
      "Make a list of all your things",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 07:27:52 -0500",
    "summary": "The bird flu is still wiping out poultry flocks, leading to supply shortages. Here's when egg prices could come down, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Egg prices continue to soar \u2014 if shoppers can even find them in grocery stores.",
      "In January alone, the cost of eggs around the U.S.\u00a0jumped more than 15%\u00a0from a year ago, to roughly $4.95 a dozen. That's\u00a0five times the overall U.S. inflation rate of 3%, Consumer Price Index data showed on Wednesday. In 2019, consumers could pick up a dozen eggs for around $1.54, but by last year the price had soared to $4.15 \u2014 a 170% increase, according to CBS News' price tracker\u00a0of everyday goods.",
      "The spike in egg prices last month underscores the devastating impact of avian flu, which killed more than 40 million egg-laying birds last year. Including ducks and chickens, 148 million birds have been ordered euthanized since the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, began spreading around the U.S. in 2022.",
      "If there's any good news, it's that egg prices are at least expected to rise more slowly over the course of the year. The January surge \"is likely a one-off,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco. But that may come as small consolation for the millions of consumers who continue to grapple with higher food costs both at home and in restaurants due to record-high egg prices.",
      "Why are egg prices so high?",
      "The price spike in eggs is largely driven by the bird flu, which continues to hit farms and wipe out flocks. When demand remains steady for a product that isn't easily substituted and supply diminishes, prices tend to rise.",
      "\"If you don't have a bird you don't have an egg,\" Sharon Linsenbardt, founder and owner of Barn Buddies Rescue and Sanctuary in Las Vegas, told CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez. The millions of egg-laying hens killed by avian influenza can't be replaced easily and quickly, added Linsenhardt, who has limited sales to two dozen eggs a family.",
      "\"High egg prices are due to the avian flu issue, which cuts the supply in the available eggs for sale,\" Columbia Business School professor Yiming Ma told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have less supply, that drives up the prices.\"",
      "Egg supplies are likely to remain constrained as long as bird flu outbreaks continue, according to David Anderson, an agricultural economics professor at Texas A&M University.",
      "Anderson, noting a cultural shift that may be exacerbating the problem, also said he has noticed that Americans are leaning toward more protein-heavy diets, driving demand for eggs.",
      "\"We have this nutritional trend, and as people incorporate more protein in their diets, that increases overall egg demand and sets a higher base for demand,\" he said. \"Then when we get this supply shock, low and behold, we get higher prices.\"",
      "Retailers rationing eggs",
      "Ongoing egg shortages and rising prices recently prompted 24-hour breakfast chain Waffle House to add a 50 cent surcharge per egg, while some major grocery chains are imposing limits on how many eggs shoppers can buy at a time.",
      "Walmart is curtailing purchases of 60-count cartons to two per purchase \"to ensure more customers can have access to eggs,\" a spokesperson for the retailer said.",
      "\"Although supply is very tight, we're working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible,\" the spokesperson added. At Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, the warehouse club is limiting the number of egg purchases to two per item at its nearly 600 stores across the U.S.",
      "As of Wednesday, most of Target's nearly 2,000 U.S. stores had eggs in stock, and the retailer only has purchase limits in place in its Hawaii stores, according to a spokesperson for the retailer. \"We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needed,\" they added.",
      "Kroger, which operates about 2,700 U.S. grocery stores, hasn't imposed a company-wide cap on egg purchases, though some stores are limiting customers to buying two dozen per visit.",
      "Giant Eagle said it was selling conventional shelled eggs \"at or below our cost across all our supermarkets\" to limit the impact of rising egg prices on its customers. The regional grocery, which operates more than 470 stores in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, is encouraging shoppers to limit their purchase to a maximum of three egg cartons per visit.",
      "Amazon-owned Whole Foods and Costco did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "When will egg prices drop?",
      "Egg prices are expected to rise a total of 20% in 2025, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the rising costs, consumer demand remains firm and could even increase as Easter approaches, offering little hope for respite on prices.",
      "Two things have to happen for prices to ease, according to experts. The U.S. must contain the bird flu, and older chickens that are past their productive primes, as well as diseased chickens, have to be replaced. Exactly how long all of this will take is uncertain.",
      "\"it's not clear that we've fully controlled the spread of bird flu. That's the first step, and it'll be a few months after that before you can breed and replace the laying population,\" Bryan Spillane, Bank of America senior food and beverage analyst, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He expects it will be at least another three to six months before prices moderate. If restaurants continue to implement surcharges for eggs, that could eventually put a damper on demand.",
      "In the near-term, Anderson expects eggs to continue hitting consumers' wallets. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see prices continue to go up, because we continue to have outbreaks,\" he said.",
      "Cost-conscious consumers can comparison shop among grocery stores, noted NerdWallet spokesperson Sara Rathner, but be aware that if price differences aren't substantial, you could eat up any cost savings on gas.",
      "Other ways to save on eggs include using store circulars, or buying them with a cash-back credit card. \"Then you're combining multiple ways to reduce your bill,\" she said.",

      "On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.5%, versus economists' forecast for a 0.3% increase, according to FactSet. That's the biggest monthly jump since August 2023.

      "\"This is not a good number,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said in an email of January's CPI data. \"This is almost starting to look like a re-run of the first half of 2024, when inflation surprised everyone (including the Fed) on the upside.\"",
      "He added, \"And it illustrates how the Fed has not completed the job of getting inflation back down just as new inflation risks - from tariff hikes and a squeeze on labor supply growth - start to emerge.\"",
      "The new data shows that inflation picked up speed at the start of the President Trump's second administration, which has signaled its intention to enact broad-based tariffs, including newly announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.",
      "Because tariffs are essentially taxes on imports that are largely passed through to U.S. consumers, Mr. Trump's import duties, if enacted, could push inflation higher in 2025, economists are forecasting.",
      "What it means for your money",
      "Higher borrowing costs for longer: With the Fed pausing on additional rate cuts, consumers are likely to pay more for loans and other debt, ranging from credit cards to auto loans.",
      "\"Today's stronger than expected CPI release is likely to further cement the [Federal Reserve's] cautious approach to easing,\" said Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email. \"We think the Fed is likely to remain in 'wait and see mode' for the time being and anticipate the Fed staying on hold at next month's meeting.\"",
      "Mortgage rates also aren't likely to see relief anytime soon. Despite Fed cuts in 2024, mortgage rates remain near 7%, or close to a 20-year high. Mortgage rates haven't followed the arc of the Fed's rate cuts because they're based on economic data as well as the 10-year Treasury yield.",

    "summary": "Although President Trump can't overturn the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, experts say he can change how it is enforced.",
    "story": [
      "Supporters of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) praise it as an important anti-bribery statute that keeps corporations honest when doing business outside the U.S. By contrast, the law's detractors say it unfairly hobbles American companies, giving an advantage to foreign players.",
      "On Monday, President Trump took a side. \"It sounds good on paper but in practicality, it's a disaster,\" he said while signing an executive order \u00a0freezing enforcement of the 1977 law. \"It's going to mean a lot more business for America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump can't overturn the law, but as head of the executive branch he can change the way it is enforced and shift resources to other Justice Department priorities.",
      "His order puts in place a 180-day \"pause\" to all investigations under the FCPA while they are being reviewed. He also ordered no new ones be opened during that period. The order also says it will halt other Justice Department \"actions\" under the law, which might mean ongoing prosecutions though that is unclear.",
      "President Trump said the pause is also necessary to give his administration time to come up with new \"reasonable\" guidelines on how to enforce the law that don't put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in striking foreign deals.",
      "The consequences could be dramatic, depending on Mr. Trump's next move, experts say.",
      "If he halts many prosecutions, essentially defanging the law, it could help U.S. businesses win deals abroad. However, doing so could also tarnish America's image as a safe place to do business, and also send a green light to corrupt autocrats ruling over impoverished people to get even richer. France, Britain, Japan and other wealthy countries could also in turn weaken their own anti-bribery laws so their companies can make payments, too.",
      "\"We are facing a Wild West situation,\" said Mark Pieth, a criminal law professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland and anti-bribery law expert. \"It will be everyone against everyone.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Duncan Levin, a criminal defense attorney, said he expects Mr. Trump to essentially kill the law by neglect.",
      "\"He can't get rid of the law, but he can refuse to enforce it,\" said Levin, who has represented high profile defendants Harvey Weinstein and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \"I don't think this is just a pause.\"",
      "What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?",
      "The FCPA is a federal law that makes it illegal for U.S. companies and individuals to make payments to foreign government officials \"to secure any improper advantage\" in order to win or retain business. It was enacted in the 1970s to address concerns of global corruption after investigators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found hundreds of American companies making questionable or illegal payments to foreign officials to win business. The law doesn't require that the bribe is actually paid, but only offered.",
      "Over the past nearly 50 years, prosecutions under the law have brought to light a long and varied list of bribes.",
      "Last year, the military contractor RTX, formerly Raytheon, paid more than $300 million to settle charges it had allegedly bribed officials in Qatar by using a sham contract and other devices to hide its tracks.",
      "In 2019, Walmart paid $282 million to settle charges from a seven-year investigation into allegations it won approval to open stores in Mexico, India and Brazil by bribing local officials, including one contact called the \"sorceress\" who had an uncanny ability to make permitting problems disappear.",
      "Who enforces the FCPA?",
      "The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles civil enforcement of bribery-related acts, and the Department of Justice, which is responsible for civil and criminal enforcement for the law.",
      "Only criminal cases carry the threat of prison time, according to the National Whistleblower Association, adding that the burden of proof is lower for civil cases. In criminal bribery cases, punishment for conviction is imprisonment of up to 20 years, and companies face fines double their profits from the illicit deal.",
      "Why is the FCPA important?",
      "The FCPA was enacted to protect U.S businesses from global corruption costs as a result of bribery.",
      "By prohibiting companies from unfair advantages through the illegal payment of foreign officials, and by requiring that companies covered by the law to keep accurate records of payment transactions and devise and maintain an adequate internal accounting controls, the FCPA protects U.S. businesses from global corruption costs stemming from bribery and helps ensure fair competition.",
      "Criticisms against the FCPA",
      "President Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Since the FCPA was enacted nearly 50 years ago, U.S. businesses have complained that it was hurting more than helping and unfair because bribes were commonplace in some countries. Then under U.S. pressure, allies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started enacting their own laws, especially after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and African and Asian countries formerly in the communist orbit opened their borders to business.",
      "Eventually, 40 wealthy countries adopted anti-bribery laws based on the FCPA, according to University of Basel's Pieth, including the ability to prosecute foreign companies operating in their countries for acts committed in a third country.",
      "Therein lies another danger of Mr. Trump weakening the FCPA, according to Pieth.\"If a U.S. company bribes because Trump is giving them the green light, the French and the British will jump on that company,\" he said. \"It will be a mess.\"",

      "The Trump administration's Feb. 8 order that employees of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau halt much of their work amounts to an existential crisis for a government agency that itself was born from crisis.",

      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world.

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 07:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time. Elon Musk's company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy there.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States didn't reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla's hospitable business dynamics in China",
      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",

    "story": [
      "Starbucks faces a new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleging the restaurant chain relies on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices\" that violate federal and state laws. The complaint\u00a0also claims the coffee chain's hiring policies have led to slower service and higher prices for consumers because it isn't recruiting the most qualified workers.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, claims Starbucks' diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies are \"mere pretext for its actual commitment to unlawful discrimination.\"",
      "The litigation comes just weeks after President Trump signed an executive order\u00a0banning diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0programs across the U.S. government, while also directing the U.S. attorney general to \"encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "A number of major retailers and other companies, along with other organizations, have recently rolled back their DEI initiatives amid pushback from conservative activists, including Ford, Google, McDonald's, Meta, Target and Walmart.",
      "In a statement to CBS News responding to Missouri's suit, Starbucks said, \"We disagree with the attorney general, and these allegations are inaccurate. We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\"",
      "The company added, \"Our hiring practices are inclusive fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time.\"",
      "Critics of DEI say employers should make their hiring decisions based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other legally protected categories. The Missouri lawsuit echoes those arguments, alleging that Starbucks' hiring practices discriminates against residents of the state.",
      "\"Starbucks' policies harm the many Missourians whom work, or would like to work, at Starbucks, but have been, are being or will be discriminated against as future victims on the basis of their race, sex, or inclusion in other protected groups,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "While Starbucks' prices and wait times have been a focus of consumer complaints in recent years, experts haven't generally blamed hiring practices for the chain's problems. Instead, analysts have pointed to inflation, which has pushed up the prices of ingredients like coffee and milk, as well as Starbucks' vast number of drink customizations, which can slow orders.",

The company adopted those policies in 2018 after two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks where they had gone for a business meeting.",

      "President Trump's tariffs on aluminum could make Coca-Cola more expensive.",

      "Quincey said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that if the tariffs go into effect, making aluminum cans more expensive, the company could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "Quincey also said the impact of the new tariffs could be negligible.",
      "\"I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion dollar U.S. business, and packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure.\"",
      "Coke could also start sourcing aluminum domestically, and raise consumer prices. Quincey noted that Coke already has \"hedging programs\" in place.",
      "\"As the relative prices of different sources of ingredients and imports change, of course we look at mitigation, productivity, efficiency, adjusting where we get our materials from. All of that goes into the equation to constantly manage how this goes through,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's aim in announcing the tariffs is to protect U.S. manufacturing. \"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands. We need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "Aluminum is generally more recyclable, and less expensive than plastic. Coke has come under fire for its single-use plastic production, and late last year cut its sustainability goals. The beverage giant is now aiming to use 35% to 40% recycled material in packaging by 2035, revised down from an earlier goal of 50%.",

      "The national average for a dozen roses this Valentine's Day is $90.50. That's a 2% increase from last year, according to FinanceBuzz.",
      "\"A lot goes into flower prices \u2014 it's not solely the rise in the price of goods, but more of a function of an entire agricultural system that relies on transportation, logistics, and of course, weather,\" Josh Koebert, a senior researcher at FinanceBuzz, said in an email.",
      "He said prices this year are more in line with inflation, versus last year when there were other factors like \"erratic weather patterns impacting flower production around the world, increased costs associated with shipping and the supply chain post-COVID, and general increased demand for plants and flowers.\"",

      "The journey of a rose from the farm to the consumer is a meticulous process that involves multiple stages, Penn said.",
      "\"It begins with breeders who invest years in developing commercially viable roses. These roses are cultivated for their rich, pigmented colors, beautiful bloom shapes, and long vase life,\" Penn said. \"Beyond aesthetics, breeders focus on ensuring the roses are disease-resistant and durable enough to withstand transportation.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We will \u2013 and we want to see them home.",
      "There are some that are supposed to \u2013 under the deal, there are some that are supposed to be released coming up next weekend. We expect that to happen, but we'd like to see them all come out. We're not going to \u2013 we're not in favor of waiting weeks and weeks.",
      "Now, that may be the process that's in place because of the deal, but we would like to see them all out as soon as possible, and we continue to coordinate. And that \u2013 that's what we'd like to see as the outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Who wouldn't want all these hostages to be home and with their families?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Want to ask you about Iran as well. President Trump has said he wants a diplomatic deal with Iran. Are you reaching out to them? And alongside that, does the U.S. support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran to take out its nuclear program?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, Israel will always have to act in what they believe is their national interest and their national defense.",
      "And so I'm not going to speak about whatever strategies they may have on this or any other topic. I will say that we don't have any outreach from Iran. We haven't seen any. And, ultimately, we've seen in the past that efforts that Iran has undertaken diplomatically have been only about how to extend the time frame that \u2013 but continue to enrich and re \u2013 and \u2013 and in addition to sponsor terrorism, in addition to build these long-range weapons, in addition to sow instability throughout the region.",
      "But let's be clear. There's been zero outreach or interest to date from Iran about any negotiated deal. Ideally, yes, I would love to wake up one day and hear the news that Iran has decided not to pursue a nuclear weapon, not to sponsor terrorism, and reengage in the world as a \u2013 as a \u2013 as a normal government.",
      "We've had no indication of any of that, not just now, but for 30 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you head from Israel to Saudi Arabia next. I know you'll be talking about Gaza, but we've also learned that Saudi Arabia is trying to facilitate this diplomacy with Russia about Ukraine.",
      "Which Russian officials do you expect to be meeting with? And what will the focus of your talks there be? Do you actually believe Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate and make concessions?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, here's what I know.",
      "I know President Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin last week. And, in it, Vladimir Putin expressed his interest in peace, and the president expressed his desire to see an end to this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and that was an enduring peace, not that we're going to have another invasion in three or four years.",
      "That's a good call. Now, obviously, it has to be followed up by action. So, the next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not. Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace. One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one.",
      "But I can tell you that Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could potentially begin that process. Other leaders have tried. They have not been able to do so. When he ran in his campaign and he was elected as president, one of his promises was, he would work to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's sustainable and fair.",
      "And, obviously, you know, this is the first step in that process, but we have a long ways to go. Again, one call doesn't make it. One meeting wouldn't make it. This \u2013 there's a lot of work to be done. But I \u2013 I thought it has \u2013 you know, even the longest journey begins with the first step.",
      "So we'll see what happens from here, hopefully good things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will you be meeting with?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, nothing's been finalized yet. I was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia anyways.",
      "We invited \u2013 we announced that trip a week ago, and \u2013 a week-and-a-half ago. So, ultimately, look, if at any point in time there's an opportunity to continue the work that President Trump started last week to begin to create an opening for a broader conversation, that it would involve Ukraine and would involve the end of the war, and would involve our allies all over the world, particularly in Europe, we're going to explore it, if that opportunity presents itself.",
      "I don't have any details for you this morning, other than to say that we stand ready to follow the president's lead on this and begin to explore ways, if those opportunities present itself, to begin a process towards peace.",
      "Now, a process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing. This war has been going on for a while.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's difficult. It's complicated. It's been bloody. It's been costly. So it will not be easy to end the conflict in this.",
      "And there are other parties at stake that have opinions on this as well. The European Union has sanctions as well. The Ukrainians are obviously fighting this war. It's their country, and they're on the front lines. So, one meeting isn't going to solve it.",
      "But I want to reiterate the president made clear he wants to end this war, and if opportunities present themselves to further that, we're going to take them if they present themselves. We'll see what happens over the next few days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, Keith Kellogg, who is the envoy appointed to help with these talks, says these are going to be parallel negotiations, meaning the Ukrainians and Russians aren't talking to each other yet.",
      "When you meet with your Russian counterpart, whoever that is, are you going to be sitting there arguing Ukraine's position?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think that we have to understand is, right now, there is no process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: What \u2013 what we have right now is a call between Putin and President Trump in which both sides expressed an interest in ending this conflict.",
      "I imagine there will be follow-up conversations to figure out what a process to talk about that would look like. And then, at that point, perhaps we can begin to share more details. So it's a bit premature. I know there's been a lot of reaction to it, because there's been no conversation about it, any serious conversation.",
      "But I want to go back to the point I made. President Trump ran. He was very clear. He thinks this war needs to end. And if he sees an opportunity to end it, which is what he's looking for, whether there is an opportunity or not, we're going to pursue it.",
      "Ultimately, it will reach a point when you are \u2013 if it's real negotiations, and we're not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they're the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they're the \u2013 they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and \u2013 and they've contributed to this effort.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We're just not there yet. We really aren't, but hopefully we will be, because we'd all like to see this war end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No doubt.",
      "The last administration did have contact through the intelligence agencies with Russia, but they didn't believe there was any proof that Vladimir Putin was interested in talks. You know the history with Vladimir Putin. He likes to use diplomacy as a cover to distract while he continues to wage war.",
      "Do you trust that this time is different?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I don't think, in geopolitics, anyone should trust anyone. I think these things have to be verified through actions.",
      "I said yesterday that peace is not a noun. It's a verb. It's an action. You have to take concrete steps towards it. What I can tell you is, I know of no better negotiator in American politics than President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't \u2013 I think President Trump will know very quickly whether to say, is this a real thing or whether this is an effort to buy time.",
      "But I don't want to prejudge that. I don't want to foreclose the opportunity to end a conflict that's already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands and continues every single day to be increasingly a war of attrition on both sides.",
      "I think everyone should be celebrating the fact that we have an American president that is seeking to promote peace in the world, not start wars, but end them, in a way that's enduring.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's something we should be happy about. Whether it's possible or not, we're certainly willing, but it's not entirely up to us, obviously, but we'll find out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did speak in a phone call with Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov. The Russian side claimed that you discussed restoring trade, which seemed to be a nod to sanctions, easing restrictions on diplomats, and other gestures like a high-level leaders meeting.",
      "Are you actually considering, is the Trump administration considering lifting sanctions on Russia?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, the phone call was to establish communications that are consistent with the call the president made last week with Vladimir Putin, because if we are \u2013 if there is going to be the possibility of \u2013 of progress here towards peace, we are going to need to talk to the Russians.",
      "I mean, that is going to have to happen, and we're going to have to be able to be able to do it across our channels.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: About lifting sanctions, though?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I also raised in that conversation concerns that \u2013 well, we didn't go into any details.",
      "I mean, what we just discussed is basically the ability to begin communicating. I had never spoken to Mr. Lavrov in my life, so it was an opportunity for us to begin to open that channel of communication, which, again, if there's the potential for peace here, that's a channel that has to exist.",
      "But let me add one more thing. I also raised the issue of our embassy in Moscow, which operates under very difficult conditions. I raised that because it's important. It's going to be very difficult to engage in communication with Russia about anything if our embassy is not functioning. And he raised concerns about his diplomatic mission in the United States.",
      "So, at a very basic level, if, in fact, there is going to be an opportunity here to pursue peace by engaging with the Russians, we're going to need to have functional embassies in Moscow and in Washington, D.C., and that's certainly something foreign ministers would talk about as a matter of normal course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what happened in Munich, Germany, at the Security Conference.",
      "Vice President Vance gave a speech, and he told U.S. allies that the threat he worries about the most is not Russia. It is not China. He called it the threat from within, and he lectured about what he described as censorship, mainly focusing, though, on including more views from the right.",
      "He also met with the leader of a far-right party known as the AfD, which, as you know, is under investigation and monitoring by German intelligence because of extremism. What did all of this accomplish, other than irritating our allies?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Why would our allies or anybody be irritated by free speech and by someone giving their opinion?",
      "We are, after all, democracies. The Munich \u2013 Munich Security Conference is largely a conference of democracies, in which one of the things that we cherish and value is the ability to speak freely and provide your opinions.",
      "And so I think if anyone's angry about his words, they don't have to agree with him, but to be angry about it, I think, actually makes his point. I thought it was actually a pretty historic speech. Whether you agree with him or not, I think the valid points he's making to Europe is, we are concerned that the true values that we share, the values that bind us together with Europe are things like free speech and democracy and our shared history in winning two World Wars and defeating Soviet communism and the like.",
      "These are the values that we shared in common. And, in that Cold War, we fought against things like censorship and oppression and so forth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And when you see backsliding, and you raise that, that's a very valid concern.",
      "We can't tell them how to run their countries. We are \u2013 he simply expressed in a speech his view of it, which a lot of people, frankly, share. And I thought he said a lot of things in that speech that needed to be said. And, honestly, I don't know why anybody would be upset about it.",
      "People are allowed \u2013 you know, you don't have to agree on someone's speech. I happen to agree with a lot of what he said, but you don't have to agree with someone's speech to \u2013 to at least appreciate the fact they have a right to say it and that you should listen to it and see whether those criticisms are valid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I assure you, the United States has come under withering criticism on many occasions from many leaders in Europe, and we don't go around throwing temper tantrums about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide.",
      "And he met with the head of a political party that has far right views and some historic ties to extreme groups. The context of that was changing the tone of it. And you know that, that the censorship was specifically about the right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I have to disagree with you. No, I have \u2013 I have to disagree with you.",
      "Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal because they hated Jews and they hated minorities and they hated those that they \u2013 they had a list of people they hated, but primarily the Jews. There was no free speech in Nazi Germany. There was none.",
      "There was also no opposition in Nazi Germany. They were a sole and only party that governed that country. So that's not an accurate reflection of history.",
      "I also think it's wrong \u2013 again, I go back to the point of his speech. The point of his speech was basically that there is an erosion in free speech and intolerance for opposing points of view within Europe, and that's of concern, because that is eroding. That's not an erosion of your military capabilities. That's not an erosion of your economic standing.",
      "That's an erosion of the actual values that bind us together in this transatlantic union that everybody talks about. And I think allies and friends and partners that have worked together now for 80 years should be able to speak frankly to one another in open forums without being offended, insulted, or upset.",
      "And I spoke to Foreign Ministers from multiple countries throughout Europe. Many of them probably didn't like the speech or didn't agree with it, but they were continuing to engage with us on all sorts of issues that unite us.",
      "So, again, at the end of the day, I think that, you know, people give all - - that is a forum in which you're supposed to be inviting people to give speeches, not basically a chorus where everyone is saying the exact same thing. That's not always going to be the case when it's a collection of democracies where leaders have the right and the privilege to speak their minds in forums such as these.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I'm told that we are out of time. A lot to get through with you. We appreciate you making time today.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to the economy and inflation, which, compared to last January, ticked up about 3 percent last week.",
      "Kevin Hassett is the director of the National Economic Council, and he joins us now. Good morning to you, Director.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, National Economic Council): Good morning, Margaret. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you, but the rest of the country saw their egg prices at the grocery store go up. We're now at a record high due to that bird flu outbreak, but also labor costs, and that's contributing to food costs overall.",
      "When will the administration get that outbreak under control?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "Well, what's going on, right, as you know, is that there is an inflation problem that's very large. We saw the Consumer Price Index come out, and we found out that the stagflation that was created by the policies of President Biden was way worse than we thought.",
      "Over the last three months, across all goods, including eggs, the average inflation rate was 4.6 percent, way above target, and an acceleration at the end of the Biden term.",
      "And, you know, this is really not just us. You could go look at Jason Furman, Larry Summers, economic advisers of President Biden kept saying, don't do this. You're going to cause massive inflation. In fact, Jason Furman has a very thought-provoking peace in \"Foreign Affairs\" right now calling the Biden economic record a tragedy.",
      "And this is them, not us, right? It's \u2013 so, now we've got a lot of things that we're doing to get ahold of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about fiscal spending there.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me. Yes, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking about fiscal spending there. But\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, where does inflation come from, right? And so what we're doing now is, we've \u2013 we've got, really, a multi-multi-faceted plan to end inflation.",
      "And I will go quickly, because I want to end with what we're doing with egg prices. But we're going to have a macroeconomic change that has supply-side tax cuts, so we have more supply, and we're going to reduce government spending, both through what DOGE is doing, and through congressional action.",
      "And so, therefore, the macroeconomic forces that Jason Furman said were a tragedy are going to be reversed. That's a good thing. Then we're also going to have a lot of energy production, a lot of deregulation. And then, finally, when needed, we're going to focus on the individual thing-by-thing pieces.",
      "And so, for example, you mentioned avian flu. President Biden didn't really have a plan for avian flu. Well, Brooke Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week on what we're going to do with avian flu.",
      "In fact, I was editing the thing with them tomorrow. But \u2013 but the final thing \u2013 and then I will give it back to you. I promise not to filibuster.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The question is, like, why did we do this? Why did we do this? That's what everybody's talking about.",
      "But the thing that I always start with when I'm looking at what we're doing, what the president wants us to do, is, why did they do that? Why did they do that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And \u2013 and there are too many times where it feels like nobody thought about that in the press, or maybe\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, gosh.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 the left wing economists. Why did they do that? Why did Biden print so much money and cause so much inflation? Why did he do it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, Kevin.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That's \u2013 that's what I'm thinking about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin, you know, we talked about that on Face the Nation quite a lot. Quite a lot.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't want \u2013 mean to criticize you. OK, good for you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, next week, we'll see the plan on how to get avian flu \u2013 how to get bird flu, under\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I could talk about it right now if you'd like to, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sure. What \u2013 what is the plan? Are you going to - - what are you going to do?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, so \u2013 so, again, the \u2013 the Biden plan was to just, you know, kill chickens. And they spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken.",
      "And so you go \u2013 I just went to the grocery store. I shop for our family, in part because I love to look at prices. And there were no eggs at the store yesterday, just a few. And \u2013 and so that happened because they killed all the chickens.",
      "And so what we need to do is have better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on, to make sure that the perimeter doesn't have to kill the chickens, have a better, smarter perimeter. And so having a smart perimeter is what we're working on. And we're finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government.",
      "And that's the kind of thing that should have happened a year ago. And if it had, then egg prices would be, you know, a lot better than they are now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But the avian flu is a real thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And, by the way, it's spread mostly by ducks and geese. And so think about it. They're killing chickens to stop the spread, but chickens don't really fly. The \u2013 the spread is happening from the geese and the ducks.",
      "And so why does it make any sense to have a big perimeter of dead chickens, when it's the \u2013 the ducks and the geese that are spreading it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Department of Agriculture policy has been to kill those chickens, as you know.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we'll watch the details of that.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But let's get back to something the president said.",
      "Higher interest rates, as you know, are part of that battle against inflation that the Federal Reserve has been waging. But, this past week, the president called for interest rates to be lowered. Why does he think that's going to lower your grocery prices?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, I \u2013 I want to say that I, just this weekend, have arranged to begin once again regular lunches with Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve.",
      "And Jay and I have a long and collegial relationship. And I'm going to go over there with him and the other governors. So we're going to talk about our views about what's going on, and listen to his. And that collegiality has been going on for four years when I was here before, and the president very much values that.",
      "I think that the \u2013 the thing about\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not to influence?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 lower interest rates \u2013 no, I'm going to talk about \u2013 well, Jay is going to \u2013 Jay is an independent person.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The Fed independence is respected. And \u2013 and the point is, the president's opinion is also \u2013 can be heard. He's the president of the United States.",
      "But here's the thing that I think is interesting, that if we get inflation under control, then that takes the pressure off the Fed. And one way to tell whether markets think, are we getting inflation under control, is to look at longer-term interest rates that the Fed doesn't affect directly.",
      "And if you look at it, the 10-year Treasury rate has dropped about 40 basis points\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 over the last couple of weeks while we announced our plan to control inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That saved the American people about $40 billion, about $40 billion, just from talking about the stuff that we're about to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That's pretty good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but the president's statement contradicts economic policy. As you know\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No. Inflation \u2013 no. Inflation rates are already \u2013 I'm saying the interest rates are already lower by 40 basis points. So, Interest rates are lower. The one that matters\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're briefing the president on it. OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 the most for the economy is maybe the 5- or 10- year rate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Those the ones that matter the most. And those are down already. So the president's right about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we run out of time, I really want to make sure I get to you on tariffs.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: OK, sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there's concern that that will add to prices.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they'll be added on to consumers and what they pay.",
      "How are these reciprocal tariffs going to work? The president was tweeting he wants to put them on, like, 175 different countries that have a VAT tax, a value-added tax.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, we're talking to leaders of other countries all the time.",
      "Last night, into the wee hours of their morning and kind of a late night for me, I was talking to Minister Reynolds from the U.K. about this very matter. But here's the way I would like to think about it, that, right now, U.S. companies are spending \u2013 are paying foreign governments about $370 billion a year in tax, and foreign companies are paying the U.S. government about $57 billion in tax.",
      "And a lot of it is because of the VAT. But if we didn't have to pay the foreign governments tax, over 10 years, it'd be about $5 trillion of tax that U.S. citizens don't have to pay. That would more than pay for the tax cuts that we're debating right now.",
      "And so if we get some of that money back, either through tariffs, or for \u2013 obviously, if they reduce the tariffs of that, then that's good for Americans. It's going to put more money in their pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And \u2013 and that's what President Trump is \u2013 is trying to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, I would like to have you come back, sit at the table\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Always.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and talk through this in \u2013 in more detail at another time. We have to leave it there for today.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Thanks. Happy \u2013 happy to be here.",

      "We spoke to two lawmakers earlier from Munich, including House Intelligence Committee Republican Dan Crenshaw. We asked him about President Zelenskyy's views regarding what's needed in a potential peace deal.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that he has asked not just for continued military support now, but security assurances in the event of a peace deal. What can you tell him about what to expect from America?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Well, I just - I just came from a lunch where General Kellogg spoke. He's the special envoy leading this effort to establish peace. And he's very clear that the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace, which, of course, involves security assurances.",
      "And part of that process is figuring out exactly what that means. Even the Ukrainians are talking about what that means. There's a variety of options, per se.",
      "I think the Europeans have to play a huge role in that. One of the things that gets talked about a lot is where do - European forces actually acting as a peacekeeping force.",
      "The Ukrainians clearly have a seat at the table and then the United States will be the intermediary as we try to establish a peace deal.",
      "But the Europeans need to demand a seat at the table by being uncomfortably aggressive, which is something they haven't done. You should be threatening things to Putin that actually make you uncomfortable because that's how - that's the only language Putin speaks is power. And when General Kellogg is at that table with Putin, he's only got a finite amount of leverage. And there's only so much more leverage that the U.S. can - can impose. And if anybody can do it, I think it's Donald Trump. And he's already - he's already said that, that nothing is off the table. Vice President Vance said that, nothing is off the table, economic, military. They will use the amount of leverage they can.",
      "My message to European leaders is, if we want to win, if we want a better outcome for Ukraine at the end of these peace talks, you need to be uncomfortably aggressive. You need to, not just bolster your own defense spending, I mean because that's a long-term issue, that's a long-term investment -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You need to be talking about where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground. Stop following our lead and actually take the lead. Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There already is a military security alliance known as NATO. You are saying you think there should be something else or some other entity providing security assurances for Ukraine?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: European soldiers. I mean, look, Europeans send aid, right? They send weapons. They do the same things we do. They - they - they match it, barely. My argument to them is you shouldn't be matching it, you should be doubling it. You should be tripling it. It's your continent.",
      "Zelenskyy had a - gave a speech today. He talked about a European army, right? So, there's - there's a lot of talk about this. Of course, there's NATO. That's - that's a security - that's a - that's a defensive alliance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: That's - that's - that's some - that's not an army. That's - they did this - we're talking about different things here.",
      "The Europeans need to come together, in my opinion, and have just a much stronger message towards Putin instead of finger wagging at us about what we're willing to give or not give in a peace deal.",
      "Again, I tell them, look, if you want a seat at the table, earn it. The Ukrainians have earned it. The Ukrainians have impressed everybody for the last three years. They've fought valiantly and courageously. They've earned my respect. They earned that seat at the table. We need to listen to their - to what they want. We listened to Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. You said that both President Trump and Vice President Vance were clear, nothing is off the table. However, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, did seem, in Brussels, to take things quite explicitly off the table. He said the U.S. does not want Ukraine in NATO and that Ukraine would not return to its pre-2014 borders, which acknowledges giving up some of Crimea and potentially the east.",
      "Do you think offering concessions before negotiations begin is a good strategy here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Yes, the - I think you have to listen to the White House as a whole. They walked - they walked those back and -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And - and made it clear that nothing is off the - nothing is off the table. So, no, you walk into a negotiation with everything on the table and I think that's exactly what this White House is doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's less than a month since this administration has been in power and they want to move fast. And everybody's a little nervous. But I think they should be much more optimistic than they should be nervous.",
      "You needed a seismic shift here. This was not a sustainable operation in Ukraine. If Kamala Harris had been president, you'd be going along the same lines, which is basically funding this war until every Ukrainian is dead. That's not an end that we can accept.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: There has to be some talk of negotiation. And I'll remind the American people, too, from our perspective, from American strategic deterrent's perspective, even getting Putin to that table to talk about an end to the war is -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Is a massive strategic win for us because it establishes back our deterrents over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, do you know that he is actually committing to come to the table? We don't have a commitment to actually negotiate from Vladimir Putin.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: No, we don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You know what would be really helpful? What I said before, if the EU was uncomfortably aggressive about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Got it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Again, Putin only responds to power. And this is - this is what I remind western leaders here, too. Western - westerners don't speak that language. Westerns talk about negotiations and, you know, and good moral values that we share and we believe each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: That's not how the east works. They only respond to power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, OK, on that point, Vladimir Putin, it sounds like you would agree, is an accused war criminal. He is a dictator. There is a warrant out for his arrest, as you know. He invaded Ukraine. He is clearly a U.S. adversary.",
      "But this past week President Trump said he'd love to have Putin back in the G-8, which would make him, again, a peer global leader. President Trump floated inviting him to the U.S. or even visiting Russia himself. Do you think any of that is appropriate?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's more appropriate than not talking to him for the last two years, which is what President Biden did. Who did that help? It hasn't - it hasn't gotten us anywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Talking is different than inviting him to the United States.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Right. Sure. I mean, you can parse it out however you like. But the reality is, is you're going to have to get him to the table somehow, right? And there's a carrot and a stick approach. Trump can use a lot - can use a lot of leverage. And then the Europeans can use a lot more leverage. But you also have that carrot approach. And Trump is good at that. He's good at flattering people in order to get them to the table. That is what we need. Whether we like it or not, that's what we need.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But flattering a very brutal dictator who is pretty cunning, frankly, you really think that's a winning strategy?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: I mean, he's not that cunning. He's fought a - it was a war that has destroyed his society, killed hundreds of thousands of Russians. He's made a massive mistake and miscalculation. He's not - he's not as clever as maybe we are giving him credit for.",
      "I think let Trump do his campaign promise and play this out. Look, nobody is going to take advantage of Donald Trump. And General Kellogg made that very clear because that was a question Europeans asked him, you know, are we - are you going to sell out just to get a deal, just to get a deal because of the campaign promise. Kellogg just laughed at that. He's like, there is no way. There is absolutely no way that Donald Trump will be seen - he will not let himself go down in history as having sold out to Putin. He will not let that happen. He believes - just for the sake of his own legacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But he does care about lasting peace here and lasting European peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I think you know some of the things Europeans point to is the fact that the United States cut out our allied government in Afghanistan from the negotiation Donald Trump cut with the Taliban. They point back to that and say, don't do this again.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Sure. And I criticized that decision, too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But that's just not what's happening now. This is a vastly different situation. I mean Europeans have all sorts of opinions. The Ukrainians, I think, are very optimistic, as they should be. We've had some very good conversations. Some very realistic conversations. And I'm very excite and optimistic about what can happen here.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We also spoke with New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen while she was in Munich, focusing on the negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, as well as bipartisan efforts in the Senate to help Ukraine.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of negotiations, there were some comments made by President Trump this week. The defense secretary said returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is unrealistic. He's suggesting that maybe the east and another part of Ukraine and Crimea will be taken by Russia. Why do you think there was this plan to give concessions before talks begin?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-NH): Well, I think it was a mixed message coming from the administration. On the one hand you heard Secretary Hegseth saying they were going to take NATO off the table, that Ukraine needed to give up territory, and on the other hand you had Vice President Vance saying that everything should be on the table, including the possibility of putting boots on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "So, it's a mixed message. I hope that the upshot of that is that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of what Congress can do, are your hands tied here or are some of your Republican colleagues willing to put something, perhaps, in an upcoming defense bill, for example, that might help Ukraine?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think that's one option. One of the things that we're talking about doing right away is making some statements on the - the repossession of assets by Russia that are held in the United States and in Europe and the importance of having those assets go to Ukraine to help both with the execution of the military conflict, but also to think about rebuilding.",
      "Again, there's bipartisan support. There was bipartisan support for the bill and there's bipartisan support to continue to try and ensure that those assets from Russia get repaid to Ukraine because Russia is really the aggressor here and we need to hold Vladimir Putin accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, your Republican counterpart, Roger Wicker, he is the chair of the Armed Services Committee, was really sharp in his comments at Munich. He was saying, he was puzzled, he was disturbed by what the defense secretary, a member of his own party, had said about Ukraine. He was very clear that what Vladimir Putin is doing, he said, is absolutely out of Adolf Hitler's playbook. Those are sharp words considering the president of the United States says he wants to meet face-to-face to Vladimir Putin and possibly bring him to the White House.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, they are sharp words and they are very much justified. Regardless of what President Trump may be doing to try and lay the groundwork for any future negotiations, the fact is there is strong bipartisan support in Congress to help Ukraine in this unfair war that Russia has initiated. And I think Senator Wicker's comments are very important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the conference you're at, you were able to speak with European leaders. What are they saying to you about their view of America now?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, we had a chance to meet with representatives from Britain, from Canada, not a European country but also very concerned about Ukraine, with people from the Balkan countries, with President Zelenskyy, obviously. And there is a great deal of concern about the U.S. position on Ukraine.",
      "At the panel that we had with President Zelenskyy, we talked about the importance of Europe and the United States acting in concert so that we can hold Putin accountable with sanctions so that we can - so that there is no daylight between the United States and our NATO allies and our European allies. Clearly that's what Vladimir Putin has been trying to do throughout this conflict, and we need to make it clear that that is not going to happen, that we are going to work together, and we are going to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does Congress need to be any part of approving this deal President Trump says he wants to take possession of some of the critical minerals that Ukraine has inside their territory? He says he wants to use that as sort of repayment for what the U.S. has spent on weapons.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think there are some benefits to having the United States have some investments in Ukraine. That's part of what a critical minerals deal would do. It's not at all clear who - who has possession of those critical minerals. Some of them are in the eastern part of Ukraine where Russia controls the territory. Some of them are owned by private - actually oligarchs. There are several oligarchs who own a number of those critical mineral sites. So, I think those are details that have not yet been worked out and I have not seen the agreement that's been put in front of President Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know Zelenskyy will be discussing that with other members of the administration. We'll stay tuned on that. But I do want to bring up something that we -",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: He -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: One of the things that, in our conversations with President Zelenskyy, President Zelenskyy reiterated nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. And I - he got reassurances from the bipartisan senators that he met with that we agree Ukraine absolutely must be part of any negotiations between Russia and the United States.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week seven federal prosecutors resigned in objection after the Justice Department directed them to drop the investigation into New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing charges, including bribery and conspiracy. In her resignation letter, Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney overseeing the case, said a dismissal amounted to a quid pro quo and that the DOJ, quote, \"proposes dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws.\"",
      "In response, then Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove threatened her with an investigation into her conduct.",
      "Joining us now is Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin. He's the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "This episode is highly unusual. Is there anything that you, in your role, can do about this episode and what's happening inside Attorney General Bondi's Justice Department?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, the Justice Department is at war with its own attorneys, its own prosecutors. And the whole episode is just saturated with corruption. It was a corruption prosecution and investigation, which led to a grand jury indictment against Eric Adams for bribery, conspiracy, other corruption charges. And then the new Department of Justice decided to squash the whole thing, basically saying to Adams, well, we will drop this case against you if you engage in certain kinds of political or policy accommodations with us.",
      "And then, in order to complete that deeply corrupt bargain, they had to try to coerce their own lawyers to do it. But, of course, the prosecutors were saying, nothing has changed in the facts of the case and nothing has changed in the law. In fact, additional evidence was found, meaning that they were going to revise and expand the original indictment, but instead they were told to kill it for political reasons.",
      "And so, you know, this is an outrageous violation of the rules of prosecutors and an offense against due process in a very dangerous first move for the Department of Justice to be making under the Trump people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Adams, of course, claims there was no quid pro quo and that none of this was wrong, but there was the lead prosecutor, as well, on this case who resigned in objection to what's happening. But it's moving forward here. This is all now in the hands of a judge. Does he have leeway to prosecute?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: So, first of all, just about Danielle Sassoon. I mean that's a very conservative U.S. attorney, and she couldn't take it. I mean you have the most conservative prosecutors in the country resigning in opposition to this steam roller on behalf of corruption. But it's not over yet because Judge Dale Ho does not have to accept the withdrawal of the charges, the dismissal of the charges, which seven Department of Justice attorneys resigned rather than be involved in. The head of the public integrity section, the head of the criminal division, five other lawyers said, no way, and they wrote very stinging rebukes of the attorney general and the Department of Justice in this case.",
      "So, Judge Ho has to accept this dismissal, but he may not. He may go ahead and try to appoint another prosecutor to go ahead and, you know, go through with the indictment that was handed down by a grand jury.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Attorney General Bondi says there's nothing wrong here, saying it was President Biden's weaponized DOJ that went after Adams for political reasons, and only after he criticized President Biden's immigration policies.",
      "This is a fellow Democrat. Do you think he should be prosecuted? And how do you respond to that allegation?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, first of all, the attorney general did not cite any changes in the facts of the case. She did not cite any changes in the law, because neither occurred, nor did she cite any irregularities in the investigation or the prosecution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She's saying it's all made up.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, then she's - she's mimicking her boss then, who just lies as a matter of course. One would expect more from the attorney general of the United States.",
      "And, you know, this whole corruption attack that is an attack on the Department of Justice for engaging in corruption prosecutions could be impeachable in a different political environment. But the fact that Mayor Adams is a Democrat is neither here nor there for me. I'm against corruption across the board. It seems like Donald Trump wants to attract all of the corrupt politicians in America to his side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in the Oval Office President Trump - you may have seen this image - he has hung a picture, a framed picture of the front page of \"The New York Post,\" that has his mugshot in it from that criminal case in New York. Yesterday he also tweeted, \"he who saves his country does not violate any law.\"",
      "He seems to believe that all those prosecutions against him were politically motivated and voters apparently didn't think it mattered. He was elected with a mandate. How do you convince the public that it does matter?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: The dominant objective of this administration is corruption and lawlessness. The first thing that they did was they sacked 17 inspectors general. Those are the people who are actual corruption fighters within the departments and agencies. These are the people who ferreted out $91 billion worth of waste, fraud and abuse in the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They argue it's within their political power to do so.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Oh, it - there's no doubt it is, but they sacked them. Actually, it's not within their political power to do so in a lawless way. They have to notify Congress first, 30 days in advance, and they have to set forth the specific reasons for why an inspector general is being fired. They never did that.",
      "And the reason, of course, is because they want to pursue agendas of corruption across the board. They're saying they're not going to enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. They are shutting down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has saved American consumers $31 million in bank overdraft charges, credit card late fees from corporations completely inflated and having nothing to do with the actual charges and so on. They're getting rid of anything in the government that supports consumers, that supports citizens against the rip-off artists who are their friends.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's little Democrats can do to push back because you don't have any political power.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we're winning in court. More than a dozen federal injunctions and temporary restraining orders have been issued against everything from their illegal seizure of computer data and every Americans' private data at the Treasury Department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",

      "Last week, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo that instructed prosecutors in Manhattan to abandon the indictment that charged Adams with\u00a0bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations, which he denied. Bove justified the decision by saying the case \"has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.\" He also alleged that the prosecution was politically motivated due to Adams' criticism of the Biden administration.",
      "The directive prompted a revolt at the Justice Department that burst into public view when Danielle Sassoon, the acting head of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, resigned in protest rather than file a motion seeking to drop the case. She was soon joined by other top Justice Department officials. Different prosecutors ultimately filed a motion late Friday to abandon the charges.",
      "Sassoon alleged in her resignation letter that the Justice Department proposed dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws. Adams' attorney denied that he offered to help enact the president's deportation agenda in exchange for having his case dropped, saying the mayor's team \"offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us.\" In response to Sassoon's resignation, Bove also denied there was any quid pro quo, writing in a letter that Sassoon's allegation was \"false.\"",

      "Crenshaw, speaking from the Munich Security Conference, was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the annual security summit in recent days.

      "The Texas Republican said Kellogg was \"very clear that what the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace,\" which he said will involve security assurances. Crenshaw said exactly what that looks like is still being determined, while arguing that Europe must be a major player.",
      "Crenshaw said European countries need to not only bolster their defense spending, but also talk about \"where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground.\"",
      "\"Stop following our lead and actually take the lead,\" Crenshaw said. \"Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation, and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin.\"",

      "But Crenshaw defended the White House's posture toward the possible peace talks, saying \"you have to listen to the White House as a whole,\" noting that the administration made clear that \"nothing is off the table.\"",
      "\"You walk into a negotiation with everything on the table. And I think that's exactly what this White House is doing,\" Crenshaw said, adding that \"there's a path forward here,\" although the details aren't yet clear.",
      "Crenshaw acknowledged that the U.S. hasn't yet received a commitment to negotiate from Putin, reiterating his request of European leaders to get \"uncomfortably aggressive\" with the Russian leader, who he said \"only responds to power.\"",

      "\"We stand ready to follow the president's lead on this and begin to explore ways, if those opportunities present itself, to begin a process toward peace,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week that he had a \"lengthy and highly productive phone call\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and announced that he was directing Rubio and other members of his national security team to \"immediately\" begin negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine.

      "Rubio, speaking from Israel where he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, is heading to Saudi Arabia on the next leg of his current trip overseas. Rubio noted that his trip had been scheduled before Mr. Trump's calls with Putin and Zelenskyy. He will be joined by national security adviser Mike Waltz and Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy.",
      "The secretary of state said Putin \"expressed his interest in peace\" during his call with Mr. Trump, who he said made clear \"his desire to see an end of this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty.\"",
      "Asked whether he believes Putin is ready to negotiate and make concessions in order to end the fighting, Rubio said the call must be followed by action, and that \"the next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not.\"",
      "\"One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one,\" Rubio said. \"But I can tell you that Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could potentially begin that process.\"",
      "Rubio, who also met with Zelenskyy at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, said \"we'll see what happens over the next few days.\" He said if there's an opportunity \"at any point in time\" to \"begin to create an opening for a broader conversation\" on ending the war, he would \"explore it.\"",
      "\"A process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing. This war has been going on for a while,\" Rubio said. \"It's difficult, it's complicated, it's been bloody, it's been costly. So it will not be easy to end a conflict like this, and there are other parties at stake that have opinions on this as well.\"",
      "The comments come as retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia who would be involved with any potential peace talks, indicated that there would be parallel tracks of negotiations, with different parties handling talks with Russia and Ukraine separately. That prospect has unsettled Ukrainian and European officials who fear being frozen out of negotiations between the U.S. and Russia.",
      "Asked about his role in the process, Rubio said \"right now there is no process,\" while adding that he expects there will follow up conversations to \"figure out what a process\" might look like.",
      "\"It's a bit premature,\" Rubio continued, saying there hasn't been any \"serious conversation.\"",
      "The secretary of state noted that if \"real negotiations\" begin, Ukraine will \"have to be involved,\" as will European countries, adding that \"we're just not there yet.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\u00a0that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week, seven federal prosecutors resigned in objection after the Justice Department directed them to drop the investigation into New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing charges including bribery and conspiracy. In her resignation letter, Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. Attorney overseeing the case, said a dismissal amounted to a quid pro quo, and that the DOJ, quote, \"proposes dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws.\" In response, then-acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove threatened her with an investigation into her conduct. Joining us now is Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin. He is the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. This episode is highly unusual. Is there anything that you in your role can do about this episode and what's happening inside Attorney General Bondi's Justice Department?",
      "REP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, the Justice Department is at war with its own attorneys, its own prosecutors, and the whole episode is just saturated with corruption. It was a corrupt- corruption prosecution and investigation which led to a grand jury indictment against Eric Adams for bribery, conspiracy, other corruption charges, and then the new Department of Justice decided to squash the whole thing, basically saying to Adams, well, we will drop this case against you if you engage in certain kinds of political or policy accommodations with us. And then, in order to complete that deeply corrupt bargain, they had to try to coerce their own lawyers to do it. But of course, the prosecutors were saying nothing has changed in the facts of the case, and nothing has changed in the law. In fact, additional evidence was found, meaning that they were going to revise and expand the original indictment, but instead they were told to kill it for political reasons. And so, you know, this is an outrageous violation of the rules of prosecutors and an offense against due process and a very dangerous first move for the Department of Justice to be making under the Trump people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Adams, of course, claims there was no quid pro quo and that none of this was wrong. But, there was the lead prosecutor as well on this case who resigned in objection to what's happening. But, it's moving forward here. This is all now in the hands of a judge. Does he have leeway to prosecute?",
      "REP. RASKIN: So- first of all, just about Danielle Sassoon, I mean, that's a very conservative U.S. attorney, and she couldn't take it. I mean, you have the most conservative prosecutors in the country resigning in opposition to this steamroller on behalf of corruption. But it's not over yet, because Judge Dale Ho does not have to accept the withdrawal of the charges, the dismissal of the charges, which seven Department of Justice attorneys resigned rather than be involved in. The head of the Public In- Integrity section, the head of the Criminal Division, five other lawyers said, no way, and they wrote very stinging rebukes of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice in this case. So Judge Ho has to accept this dismissal, but he may not. He may go ahead and try to appoint another prosecutor to go ahead and go through with the indictment that was handed down by grand jury.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Attorney General Bondi says there's nothing wrong here, saying it was President Biden's weaponized DOJ that went after Adams for political reasons, and only after he criticized President Biden's immigration policies. This is a fellow Democrat. Do you think he should be prosecuted? And how do you respond to that allegation?",
      "REP. RASKIN: Well, first of all the Attorney General did not cite any changes in the facts of the case. She did not cite any changes in the law, because neither occurred, nor did she cite any irregularities in the investigation or the prosecution--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You're saying it's all made up?",
      "REP. RASKIN: Well, then she's mimicking her boss, then, who just lies as a matter of course, one would expect more from the Attorney General of the United States. And- you know, this whole corruption attack- that is an attack on the Department of Justice for engaging in corruption prosecutions, could be impeachable in a different political environment, but the fact that Mayor Adams is a Democrat is neither here nor there, for me. I'm against corruption across the board. It seems like Donald Trump wants to attract all of the corrupt politicians in America to his side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in the Oval Office, President Trump- you may have seen this image, he has hung a picture, a framed picture, of the front page of the \"New York Post\" that has his mug shot in it from that criminal case in New York. Yesterday, he also tweeted \"He who saves his country does not violate any law.\" He seems to believe that all those prosecutions against him were politically motivated, and voters apparently didn't think it mattered. He was elected with a mandate. How do you convince the public that it does matter?",
      "REP. RASKIN: The- the dominant objective of this administration is corruption and lawlessness. The first thing that they did was they sacked 17 inspectors general. Those are the people who are actual corruption fighters within the departments and the agencies. These are the people who ferreted out $91 billion worth of waste, fraud and abuse in the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They argue it's within their political power to do so.",
      "REP. RASKIN: Oh it- there's no doubt it is, but they sacked them- actually, it's not within their political power to do so in a lawless way. They have to notify Congress first, 30 days in advance, and they have to set forth the specific reasons for why an Inspector General is being fired. They never did that. And the reason, of course, is because they want to pursue agendas of corruption across the board. They're saying they're not going to enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. They are shutting down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has saved American consumers $31 million in bank overdraft charges, credit card late fees from corporations completely inflated and having nothing to do with actual charges and so on. They're getting rid of anything in the government that supports consumers, that supports citizens, against the rip off artists who are their friends.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's little Democrats can do to push back because you don't have any political power.",
      "REP. RASKIN: Well, we're winning in court. More than a dozen federal injunctions and temporary restraining orders have been issued against everything from their illegal seizure of computer data and every American's private data at the Treasury Department, to their illegal attempt to ban birthright citizenship in America, we're winning across the board. We are a country--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch--",
      "REP. RASKIN: --based on law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --what happens in those court decisions. Thank you, Congressman Raskin, we'll be right back.",
      "REP. RASKIN: You bet.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council,\u00a0that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to the economy and inflation, which, compared to last January, ticked up about 3% last week. Kevin Hassett is the director of the National Economic Council, and he joins us now. Good morning to you, Director.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Good morning, Margaret, good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you, but the rest of the country saw their egg prices at the grocery store go up. We're now at a record high due to that bird flu outbreak, but also labor costs, and that's contributing to food costs overall. When will the administration get that outbreak under control?",
      "HASSETT: Right, well, what's going on, right, as you know, is that there is an inflation problem that's very large. We saw the consumer price index come out, and we found out that the stagflation that was created by the policies of President Biden was way worse than we thought. Over the last three months, across all goods, including eggs, the average inflation rate was 4.6%, way above target, and an acceleration at the end of the Biden term. And, you know, this is really not just us. You could go look at Jason Furman, Larry Summers, economic advisers of President Biden kept saying, don't do this. You're going to cause massive inflation. In fact, Jason Furman has a very thought provoking peace in \"Foreign Affairs\" right now, calling the Biden economic record a tragedy. And this is them, not us, right? It's- so, now we've got a lot of things that we're doing to get ahold of it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about fiscal spending there.",
      "HASSETT: Excuse me? Yeah, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking about fiscal spending there. But--",
      "HASSETT: Well, where does inflation come from, right? And so what we're doing now is, we've- we've got, really, a multi- multi-faceted plan to end inflation, and I'll go quickly, because I want to end with what we're doing with egg prices, but we're going to have a macroeconomic change that has supply side tax cuts so we have more supply, and we're going to reduce government spending, both through what DOGE is doing, and through congressional action. And so therefore, the macroeconomic forces that Jason Furman said were a tragedy are going to be reversed. That's a good thing. Then we're also going to have a lot of energy production, a lot of deregulation. And then finally, when needed, we're going to focus on the individual thing-by-thing pieces. And so, for example, you mentioned avian flu. President Biden didn't really have a plan for avian flu. Well, Brooke Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week on what we're going to do with avian flu. In fact, I was editing the thing with them tomorrow, but- but the final thing- and then I'll give it back to you, I promise not to filibuster- that, the question is like, why did we do this? Why did we do this? That's what everybody's talking about. But the thing that I always start with when I'm looking at what we're doing, what the President wants us to do, is, why did they do that? Why did they do that? And- and there are too many times where it feels like nobody thought about that in the press, or maybe--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, gosh--",
      "HASSET: --the left wing \"Economist,\" why did they do that? Why did Biden print so much money and cause so much inflation? Why did he do it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, Kevin--",
      "HASSETT: That's- that's what I'm thinking about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin, you know, we talked about that on \"Face the Nation\" quite a lot. Quite a lot.",
      "HASSETT: I don't mean to criticize you. Okay, good for you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 No, no, no. So next week, we'll see the plan on how to get avian flu- how to get bird flu, under--",
      "HASSETT: I could talk about it right now if you'd like to, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --well, sure, what- what is the plan you're going to- what are you going to do?",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, so- so again, the- the Biden plan was to just, you know, kill chickens, and they spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken. And so you go- I just went to the grocery store. I shop for our family, in part because I love to look at prices. And there were no eggs at the store yesterday, just a few. And- and so that happened because they killed all the chickens. And so what we need to do is have better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on, to make sure that the perimeter doesn't have to kill the chickens. Have a better, smarter perimeter. And so having a smart perimeter is what we're working on, and we're finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government. And that's the kind of thing that should have happened a year ago, and if it had, then egg prices would be, you know, a lot better than they are now. But the avian flu is a real thing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "HASSETT: --and by the way, it's spread mostly by ducks and geese. And so- think about it, they're killing chickens to stop the spread, but chickens don't really fly. The- the spread is happening from the geese and the ducks. And so, why does it make any sense to have a big perimeter of dead chickens, when it's the- the ducks and the geese that are spreading it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Department of Agriculture policy has been to kill those chickens, as you know, but we'll watch the details of that. But let's get back to something the president said. Higher interest rates, as you know, are part of that battle against inflation that the Federal Reserve has been waging, but this past week, the President called for interest rates to be lowered. Why does he think that's going to lower your grocery prices?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, I- I want to say that- I, just this weekend, have arranged to begin, once again, regular lunches with Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve. And Jay and I have a long and collegial relationship, and I'm going to go over there with him and the other governors. So we're going to talk about our views about what's going on, and listen to his and that collegiality has been going on for four years when I was here before, and the President very much values that. I think that the- the thing about--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not to influence--",
      "HASSETT: --lower interest rates, no, I'm going to talk about- well, Jay is going to- Jay is an independent person. The Fed- independence is respected. And- and the point is, the President's opinion is also- can be heard. He's the president of the United States. But here's the thing that I think is interesting, that if we get inflation under control, then that takes the pressure off the Fed. And one way to tell whether markets think, are we getting inflation under control, is to look at longer term interest rates that the Fed doesn't affect directly. And if you look at it, the 10 year treasury rate has dropped about 40 basis points over the last couple of weeks while we announced our plan to control inflation. That saved the American people about $40 billion, about $40 billion, just from talking about the stuff that we're about to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "HASSETT: It's pretty good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But the President's statement contradicts economic policy, as you know--",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, inflation- no, inflation rates are already- I'm saying the interest rates are already lower by 40 basis points. So, in- interest rates are lower. The one that matters--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're briefing the president on it. Okay--",
      "HASSETT: --the most for the economy is maybe the 5 or 10, year rate. Those the ones that matter the most. So those are down already. So the President's right about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we run out of time, I really want to make sure I get to you on tariffs--",
      "HASSETT: Okay, sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --because there's concern that that will add to prices, because they'll be added on to consumers and what they pay. How are these reciprocal tariffs going to work? The President was tweeting he wants to put them on, like 175 different countries that have a VAT tax, a value added tax.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, we're talking to leaders of other countries all the time. Last night into the wee hours of their morning and kind of a late night for me, I was talking to Minister Reynolds from the UK about this very matter. But here's the way I'd like to think about it, that right now, U.S. companies are spending, are paying, foreign governments about $370 billion a year in tax, and foreign comp- companies are paying the U.S. government about $57 billion in tax, and a lot of it is because of the VAT. But if we didn't have to pay the foreign government's tax, over 10 years, it'd be about $5 trillion of tax that U.S. citizens don't have to pay. That would more than pay for the tax cuts that we're debating right now. And so if we get some of that money back, either through tariffs, or for, obviously, if they reduce the tariffs of that, that that's good for Americans, it's going to put more money in their pockets, and- and that's what President Trump is trying to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, I'd like to have you come back, sit at the table and talk through this in- in more detail at another time. We have to leave it there for today.",
      "HASSETT: Thanks. Happy, happy to be here.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" We want to begin today with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is in Jerusalem on the second leg of his trip through Europe and the Middle East. Mr. Secretary, I know it's the evening hours there, and you've had a long day. We appreciate your time. You've got quite a busy schedule. You met earlier with Prime Minister Netanyahu. He said he's lock step with the Trump administration, but he can't share details on, quote, \"when the gates of hell will be open\u2026if all our hostages are not released.\" Did he tell you he wants to keep talks going to get to phase two of this hostage deal?",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think we share a common goal. We want to see every hostage released. Frankly, I think, and the President has said this, we want to see them out as soon as we possibly can. And- and certainly, you know, the world has watched these images of people, and it's just heartbreaking to remember that some of them have been now almost two years there. It's a horrifying situation. So we coordinate and work very close with them. We share the goal that every hostage needs to come home, every single one, without delay. Obviously, the- there are details of how we're pursuing that and coordinating that we're not going to share publicly because we don't want to endanger the hostages and we don't want to endanger this process. But suffice it to say that if it was up to us, every one of these hostages would be home right now, and we want it to happen as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so the deal stands?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Again, we want every hostage out as soon as possible, and- and we want to see them home. There are some that are supposed to- under the deal, there are some that are supposed to be released coming up next weekend. We expect that to happen, but we'd like to see them all come out. We're not going to- we're not in favor of waiting weeks and weeks. Now, that may be the process that's in place because of the deal, but we would like to see them all out as soon as possible, and we continue to coordinate. That- that's what we'd like to see as the outcome. Who wouldn't want all these hostages to be home and with their families?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. I want to ask you about Iran as well. President Trump has said he wants a diplomatic deal with Iran. Are you reaching out to them? And alongside that, does the U.S. support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran to take out its nuclear program?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, first of all, Israel will always have to act in what they believe is their national interest and their national defense. And so I'm not going to speak about whatever strategies they may have on this or any other topic. I will say that we don't have any outreach from Iran. We haven't seen any, and ultimately, we've seen in the past that efforts that Iran has undertaken diplomatically have been only about how to extend the time frame that- but continue to enrich and rep- and- and in addition to sponsored terrorism, in addition to build these long range weapons, in addition to sow instability throughout the region. But let's be clear, there's been zero outreach or interest to date from Iran about any negotiated deal. Ideally, yeah, I would love to wake up one day and hear the news that Iran has decided not to pursue a nuclear weapon, not to sponsor terrorism, and re-engage in the world as a- as a- as a normal government. We've had no indication of any of that, not just now, but for 30 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you head from Israel to Saudi Arabia next, I know you'll be talking about Gaza, but we've also learned that Saudi Arabia is trying to facilitate this diplomacy with Russia about Ukraine. Which Russian officials do you expect to be meeting with, and what will the focus of your talks there be? Do you actually believe Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate and make concessions?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, here's what I know. I know President Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin last week, and in it, Vladimir Putin expressed his interest in peace, and the President expressed his desire to see an end to this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and that was an enduring peace, not that we're going to have another invasion in three or four years. That's a good call. Now, obviously it has to be followed up by action, so the next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not. Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace. One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one. But I can tell you that Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could potentially begin that process. Other leaders have tried, they have not been able to do so. When he ran in his campaign and he was elected as president, one of his promises was, he would work to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's sustainable and fair. And obviously, you know, this is the first step in that process, but we have a long ways to go. Again, one call doesn't make it, one meeting wouldn't make it. This- there's a lot of work to be done. But I- I thought it has- you know, even the longest journey begins with the first step. So we'll see what happens from here, hopefully good things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will you be meeting with?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, nothing's been finalized yet. I was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia anyways, we invited- we announced that trip a week ago, and- a week and a half ago. So ultimately, look, if at any point in time there's an opportunity to continue the work that President Trump started last week, to begin to create an opening for a broader conversation, that it would involve Ukraine and would involve the end of the war, and would involve our allies all over the world, particularly in Europe, we're going to explore it, if that opportunity presents itself. I don't have any details for you this morning, other than to say that we stand ready to follow the president's lead on this and begin to explore ways, if those opportunities present itself, to begin a process towards peace. Now, a process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing. This war has been going on for a while. It's difficult, it's complicated. It's been bloody, it's been costly, so it will not be easy to end a conflict- and there are other parties at stake that have opinions on this as well. The European Union has sanctions as well. The Ukrainians are obviously fighting this war. It's their country, and they're on the front lines. So, one meeting isn't going to solve it, but I want to reiterate, the President made clear he wants to end this war, and if opportunities present themselves to further that, we're going to take them if they present themselves. We'll see what happens over the next few days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, Keith Kellogg, who is the envoy appointed to help with these talks, says these are going to be parallel negotiations, meaning the Ukrainians and Russians aren't talking to each other yet. When you meet with your Russian counterpart, whoever that is, are you going to be sitting there arguing Ukraine's position?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think the- we have to understand is, right now there is no process. What- what we have right now is a call between Putin and President Trump in which both sides expressed an interest in ending this conflict. I imagine there will be follow up conversations to figure out what a process to talk about that would look like, and then at that point, perhaps we can begin to share more details. So it's a bit premature. I know there's been a lot of reaction to it, because there's been no conversation about it, any serious conversation, but I want to go back to the point I made. President Trump ran, he was very clear, he thinks this war needs to end, and if he sees an opportunity to end it, which is what he's looking for, whether there is an opportunity or not, we're going to pursue it. Ultimately, it will reach a point when you are- if it's real negotiations, and we're not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they're the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because the oth- they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and- and they've contributed to this effort. We're just not there yet. We really aren't, but hopefully we will be, because we'd all like to see this war end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No doubt, the last administration did have contact through the intelligence agencies with Russia, but they didn't believe there was any proof that Vladimir Putin was interested in talks. You know the history with Vladimir Putin. He likes to use diplomacy as a cover to distract while he continues to wage war. Do you trust that this time is different?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, I don't think in geopolitics, anyone should trust anyone. I think these things have to be verified through actions. I said yesterday that peace is not a noun, it's a verb. It's an action. You have to take concrete steps towards it. What I can tell you is, I know of no better negotiator in American politics than President Trump. I don't- I think President Trump will know very quickly whether they say- is this a real thing, or whether this is an effort to buy time. But I don't want to prejudge that. I don't want to foreclose the opportunity to end a conflict that's already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands and continues every single day to be, increasingly, a war of attrition on both sides. I think everyone should be celebrating the fact that we have an American president that is seeking to promote peace in the world, not start wars, but end them, in a way that's enduring. That's something we should be happy about. Whether it's possible or not, we're certainly willing, but it's not entirely up to us, obviously, but we'll find out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did speak in a phone call with Russia's top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov. The Russian side claimed that you discussed restoring trade, which seemed to be a nod to sanctions, easing restrictions on diplomats, and other gestures like a high level leaders meeting. Are you actually considering- is the Trump administration considering lifting sanctions on Russia?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, the phone call was to establish communications that are consistent with the call the President made last week with Vladimir Putin. Because if- we are- if there is going to be the possibility of- of progress here towards peace, we are going to need to talk to the Russians. I mean, that is going to have to happen, and we're going to have to be able to be able to do it across our channels--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: About lifting sanctions, though?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: --I also raised in that conversation concerns that- well, we didn't go into any details. I mean, what we just discussed is basically the ability to begin communicating. I'd never spoken to Mr. Lavrov in my life, so it was an opportunity for us to begin to open that channel of communication, which, again, if there's the potential for peace here, that's a channel that has to exist. But let me add one more thing. I also raised the issue of our embassy in Moscow, which operates under very difficult conditions. I raised that because it's important, it's going to be very difficult to engage in communication with Russia about anything if our embassy is not functioning. And he raised concerns about his diplomatic mission in the United States. So at a very basic level, if, in fact, there is going to be an opportunity here to pursue peace by engaging with the Russians, we're going to need to have functional embassies in Moscow and in Washington, D.C., and that's certainly something foreign ministers would talk about as a matter of normal course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what happened in Munich, Germany, at the Security Conference. Vice President Vance gave a speech, and he told U.S. allies that the threat he worries about the most is not Russia, it is not China. He called it the \"threat from within,\" and he lectured about what he described as censorship, mainly focusing, though, on including more views from the right. He also met with the leader of a far-right party known as the AfD, which, as you know, is under investigation and monitoring by German intelligence because of extremism. What did all of this accomplish, other than irritating our allies?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Why would our allies or anybody be irritated by free speech and by someone giving their opinion? We are, after all, democracies. The Munich- Munich Security Conference is largely a conference of democracies in which one of the things that we cherish and value is the ability to speak freely and provide your opinions. And so, I think if anyone's angry about his words, they don't have to agree with him, but to be angry about it, I think actually makes his point. I thought it was actually a pretty historic speech, whether you agree with him or not. I think the valid points he's making to Europe is, we are concerned that the true values that we share, the values that bind us together with Europe, are things like free speech and democracy and our shared history in winning two world wars and defeating Soviet communism and the like. These are the values that we shared in common, and in that cold war we fought against things like censorship and oppression and so forth, and when you see backsliding, and you raise that, that's a very valid concern. We can't tell them how to run their countries. We are- he simply expressed in a speech his view of it, which a lot of people, frankly, share. And I thought he said a lot of things in that speech that needed to be said. And honestly, I don't know why anybody would be upset about it. People are- you know, you don't have to agree on someone's speech. I happen to agree with a lot of what he said, but you don't have to agree with someone's speech to- to at least appreciate the fact they have a right to say it and that you should listen to it and see whether those criticisms are valid. I assure you, the United States has come under withering criticism on many occasions from many leaders in Europe, and we don't go around throwing temper tantrums about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide, and he met with the head of a political party that has far-right views and some historic ties to extreme groups. The context of that was changing the tone of it. And you know that. That the censorship was specifically about the right--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: -- Well I have to disagree with you. No- I have- I have to disagree with you. Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal because they hated Jews and they hated minorities and they hated those that they- they had a list of people they hated, but primarily the Jews. There was no free speech in Nazi Germany. There was none. There was also no opposition in Nazi Germany, they were a sole and only party that governed that country. So that's not an accurate reflection of history. I also think it's wrong- again, I go back to the point of his speech. The point of his speech was basically that there is an erosion in free speech and intolerance or opposing points of view within Europe, and that's of concern because that is eroding. That's not an erosion of your military capabilities, that's not an erosion of your economic standing, that's an erosion of the actual values that bind us together in this transatlantic union that everybody talks about, and I think allies and friends and partners that have worked together now for 80 years, should be able to speak frankly to one another in open forums without being offended, insulted, or upset. And I spoke to Foreign Ministers from multiple countries throughout Europe. Many of them probably didn't like the speech or didn't agree with it, but they were continuing to engage with us on all sorts of issues that unite us. So again, at the end of the day, I think that, you know, people give all- that is a forum in which you're supposed to be inviting people to give speeches, not basically a chorus where everyone is saying the exact same thing. That's not always going to be the case when it's a collection of democracies where leaders have the right and the privilege to speak their minds in forums such as these.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I'm told that we are out of time. A lot to get through with you. We appreciate you making time today. We'll be back in a minute.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with GOP Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And joining me now is Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joining us from Munich Security Conference. Senator, you were on stage with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy Friday, discussing the future of U.S. and Ukraine security cooperation. He said he hopes President Trump will help Ukraine. Can Congress? Can senators like yourself give him any assurances that U.S. support in his fight with Russia will continue?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, we had a bipartisan panel participating with President Zelenskyy, two Democrats, two Republicans, and I think it's fair to say that we were unanimous in our support for Ukraine, for continuing the fight against Russia, for thinking about how we hold Vladimir Putin accountable, and for providing as much leverage as we can to Ukraine before any kind of negotiations start to end the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of negotiations, there were some comments made by President Trump this week. There were also comments made by his Defense Secretary that I know got a lot of attention among our European counterparts. The Defense Secretary said returning to Ukraine's pre 2014 borders is unrealistic. He's suggesting that maybe the east and another part of Ukraine and Crimea will be taken by Russia. Why do you think there was this plan to give concessions before talks begin?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I think it was a mixed message coming from the administration. On the one hand, you heard Secretary Hegseth saying they were going to take NATO off the table, that Ukraine needed to give up territory, and on the other hand, you had Vice President Vance yesterday, or at the conference, saying that everything should be on the table, including the possibility of putting boots on the ground in Ukraine. So it's a mixed message. I hope that the upshot of that is that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of what Congress can do, are your hands tied here? Or are some of your Republican colleagues willing to put something perhaps in an upcoming defense bill, for example, that might help Ukraine?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I think that's one option. One of the things that we're talking about doing right away is making some statements on the the repossession of assets by Russia that are held in the United States and in Europe, and the importance of having those assets go to Ukraine to help both with the execution of the military conflict, but also to think about rebuilding.\u00a0 Again, there's bipartisan support, there was bipartisan support for the bill, and there's bipartisan support to continue to try and ensure that those assets from Russia get repaid to Ukraine, because Russia is really the aggressor here, and we need to hold Vladimir Putin accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, your Republican counterpart, Roger Wicker, He is the chair of the Armed Services Committee was really sharp in his comments at Munich. He was saying he was puzzled. He was disturbed by what the Defense Secretary, a member of his own party, had said about Ukraine. He was very clear that what Vladimir Putin is doing, he said, is absolutely out of Adolf Hitler's playbook. Those are sharp words, considering the President of the United States says he wants to meet face to face to Vladimir Putin and possibly bring him to the White House.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, they are sharp words, and they are very much justified, regardless of what President Trump may be doing to try and lay the groundwork for any future negotiations. The fact is, there is strong bipartisan support in Congress to help Ukraine in this unfair war that Russia has initiated. And I think Senator Wicker's comments are very important. We need to make sure that the world knows that we want to hold Vladimir Putin and Russia accountable for what, for what they've done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the conference you're at, you are able to speak with European leaders. What are they saying to you about their view of America now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, we're here in Munich, which is one of the biggest security conferences worldwide, and we have leaders from all over the world, a lot of European leaders. And we had a chance to meet with representatives from Britain, from Canada, not a European country, but also very concerned about Ukraine. With- people from the Balkan countries, with President Zelenskyy, obviously, and there is a great deal of concern about the U.S. position on Ukraine. At the panel that we had with President Zelenskyy, we talked about the importance of Europe and the United States acting in concert so that we can hold Putin accountable with sanctions, so that we can- so that there is no daylight between the United States and our NATO allies and our European allies. Clearly, that's what Vladimir Putin has been trying to do throughout this conflict, and we need to make it clear that that is not going to happen, that we are going to work together and we are going to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does Congress need to be any part of approving this deal President Trump says he wants, to take possession of some of the critical minerals that Ukraine has inside their territory? He says he wants to use that as sort of repayment for what the U.S. has spent on weapons.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I think there are some benefits to having the United States have some investments in Ukraine. That's part of what a critical minerals deal would do. It's not at all clear who- who has possession of those critical minerals. Some of them are in the eastern part of Ukraine, where Russia controls the territory, some of them are owned by private- actually, oligarchs. There are some oligarchs who own a number of those critical mineral sites. So I think those are details that have not yet been worked out, and I have not seen the agreement that's been put in front of President Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know Zelenskyy will be discussing that with other members of the administration. We'll stay tuned on that, but I do want to bring up something that we--",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: He--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, go ahead.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I just- I wanted to- one of the things that in our conversations with President Zelenskyy, that we talked about, that I know that he's got to be concerned about, is making sure that Ukraine is at the table, whether literally, or however those negotiations work out, for any conversations about what happens in Ukraine, and President Zelenskyy reiterated, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. And I- he got reassurances from the bipartisan senators that he met with, that we agree, Ukraine absolutely must be part of any negotiations between Russia and the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, for this administration, they have made the argument time and again that Europe needs to do more to defend itself, that the U.S. can't be responsible for it. Senator Lindsey Graham, who was alongside you with Zelenskyy, defended President Trump's phone call earlier this week with Vladimir Putin, saying, \"All the people worried about the phone call, where were you when we needed to stop Putin?\" He was talking about going all the way back to 2014, in the Obama administration. What do you think- you know, how do you respond to this idea that this was just a conversation, and that if people were truly worried about security, they should have done more earlier?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, I think we should have done more earlier. In 2014 I was in the group that said we needed to give lethal weapons to Ukraine so that they could fight back. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, but- but now the issue is, what are we going to do to ensure that they can continue to protect their territorial integrity, that we don't allow Vladimir Putin, or any other dictator, to unilaterally invade a country just because they want to get the territory? And we know that China and President Xi are watching very closely what happens in Ukraine. We've seen North Korea send troops, and they're losing thousands of North Koreans in this battle. We know Iran is watching. So this is not just about Russia and Ukraine. It's also about our other adversaries, and whether both our allies and our adversaries understand that we are going to stand up and support our allies and do everything we can to ensure that they are successful, that the United States is not going to walk away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about China. You wrote a letter along with your Republican colleague, Susan Collins, stating concern that this so-called buyout program the Trump administration is offering would leave at risk a Navy shipyard in the Northeast that helps to service submarines. You pointed right at the nuclear threat posed by China to the United States. Have you responded- have you received a response from the Navy, and how significant of an impact will this have?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, we haven't received a response. That was in- with concern about a shipyard, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard that New Hampshire and Maine shares. So the delegations from both New Hampshire and Maine are very concerned about what happens at the shipyard. They do maintenance and repair on our nuclear submarine fleet. It's one of the areas where we have an advantage over China. We need to ensure that our submarine fleet is maintained, that it's out and sea worthy, and we need to ensure that we have the workers that it takes to do all of that work, that we are able to make the investments in our public shipyards so they can do the repairs and make sure that those nuclear submarines are patrolling our seas and keeping America safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I need to ask you about this freeze on foreign assistance. I know one of your colleagues has put a hold on all the picks to go to the State Department to work under Secretary Rubio because of these objections, do you support putting a freeze on getting Secretary Rubio's team in place? Is that in the best interest of the country right now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Listen, I think we need to get all of our diplomatic officials on the ground as quickly as possible. But what Elon Musk and this administration have done is to unilaterally stop our programs that are providing critical foreign assistance that help keep America safe, that help blunt China, that help address- I mean, in Ukraine, we know that there are programs that have been stopped because of what's happening. We have commodities that are from U.S. farmers that are sitting in ports around the world and in the U.S. that can't get to the people. These are commodities that have been paid for and they can't get unloaded because of the stop work orders and this freeze. That doesn't make sense. That's not efficient. And what we're doing is leaving a vacuum for China and Russia and our adversaries to move into and really eliminate the trust that has been built over years because of all of the good work that has been done by these foreign assistance efforts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Shaheen, thank you for your time today.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Thank you.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas, who joins us from the Munich Security Conference. Congressman, thank you for joining us. You recently met with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, along with a bipartisan group of lawmakers. I understand that he has asked, not just for continued military support now, but security assurances in the event of a peace deal. What can you tell him about what to expect from America?",
      "REP. DAN CRENSHAW: I just- I just came from a lunch where General Kellogg spoke as a Special Envoy leading this effort to establish peace. And he's very clear that what the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace, which, of course, involves security assurances. And part of that process is figuring out exactly what that means. Even the Ukrainians are talking about what that means. There's a variety of options, per se. I think the Europeans have to play a huge role in that. One of the things that gets talked about a lot is, what are European forces actually acting as a peacekeeping force? I'm here to constantly remind the Europeans, and I made this clear in various meetings here today, that, you know, if you want a seat at the table, because this is- this was a contentious issue that came up. You know, the Ukrainians clearly have a seat at the table, and the United States will be the intermediate- intermediary as we try to establish a peace deal. But the Europeans need to demand a seat at the table by- by being uncomfortably aggressive, which is something they haven't done. They often talk--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- What do you mean? --",
      "REP. DAN CRENSHAW: -- about how they have matched U.S.- I'm telling you what I mean. They often talk about how they've matched U.S. aid, for instance. And I say, well, you should be doubling it. You should be tripling it. It's your continent. You should be threatening things to Putin that actually make you uncomfortable, because that's how- that's the only language Putin speaks is power. And when General Kellogg is at that table with Putin, he's only got a finite amount of leverage, and there's only so much more leverage that the U.S. can- can impose. And if anybody can do it, I think it's Donald Trump, and he's already- he's already said that, that nothing is off the table. Vice President Vance said that nothing is off the table. Economic, military, they will use the amount of leverage they can. My message to European leaders, I'm really not talking to you right now, I'm talking to European leaders right now, is if we want to win, if we want a better outcome for Ukraine, at the end of these peace talks, you need to be uncomfortably aggressive. You need to not just bolster your own defense spending, I mean because that's a long-term issue. That's a long term investment. You need to be talking about where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground. Stop following our lead and actually take the lead. Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation and- and- and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I just want to understand what you're describing here. There already is a military security alliance known as NATO. You are saying you think there should be something else, or some other entity providing security assurances for Ukraine?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: European soldiers. I mean- look, Europeans send aid, right? They send weapons. They do the same things we do, they match it barely. My argument to them is you shouldn't be matching it. You should be doubling it. You should be tripling it. It's your continent. Zelenskyy had a- gave a speech today. He talked about a European army, right? So there's- there's- there's a lot of talk about this. Of course, there's NATO. That's- that's a security that's- that's a defensive alliance. That's- that's- that's not an army. That's- we're talking about different things here. The Europeans need to come together, in my opinion, and have just a much stronger message towards Putin, instead of finger wagging at us about what we're willing to give and not give in a peace deal. Again, I tell them, look, if you- if you want a seat at the table, earn it. The Ukrainians have earned it. The Ukrainians have impressed everybody for the last three years. They've fought valiantly and courageously. They've earned my respect. They earned that seat at the table. We need to listen to their- to what they want. We listen to Zelenskyy. And I want to listen to other European leaders as well, but I want them to be uncomfortably aggressive, because that gives us more leverage in order to help Ukraine come out with a better outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. You said that both President Trump and Vice President Vance were clear, nothing is off the table. However, the Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth did seem, in Brussels, to take things quite explicitly off the table. He said the U.S. does not want Ukraine in NATO and that Ukraine would not return to its pre-2014 borders, which acknowledges giving up some of Crimea and potentially the east. Do you think offering concessions before negotiations begin is a good strategy here?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Yeah, I think you have to listen to the White House as a whole. They walked- they walked those back and made it clear that nothing is off- nothing is off the table. So- no, you walk into a negotiation with everything on the table. And I think that's exactly what this White House is doing and what General Kellogg is, I think, the right guy to do it. And again, I just heard from him speak to a whole group of European leaders. We were there with Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian leaders. And look, there's a path forward here. We don't know the details yet, because we barely started. It's less than a month since this administration has been in power, and they want to move fast, and everybody's a little nervous, but I think they should be much more optimistic than they should be nervous. You needed a seismic shift here. This is not a sustainable operation in Ukraine. If Kamala Harris had been president, you'd be going along the same lines, which is basically funding this war until every Ukrainian is dead. That's not an end that we can accept. There has to be some talk of negotiation. You know, I remind American people to from- from our perspective, from- from American strategic deterrence perspective, even getting Putin to that table to talk about an end to the war is a massive strategic win for us, because it establishes back our deterrence over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know that he is actually committing to come to the table? Secretary of State Rubio said the other day, the Russians haven't even figured out if they have, you know, picked out negotiators. We don't have a commitment to actually negotiate from Vladimir Putin.",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: No, we don't. And you know what would be really helpful? What I said before, if the EU was uncomfortably aggressive about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Got it--",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Again, Putin only responds to power. And this is- this is what I remind Western leaders here to. Western- Westerners don't speak that language. Westerners talk about negotiations and- and, you know- and good moral values that we share and we believe each other. That's not how the East works. They only respond to power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, okay, on that point, Vladimir Putin, it sounds like you would agree, is an accused war criminal. He is a dictator. There is a warrant out for his arrest, as you know, he invaded Ukraine. He is clearly a U.S. adversary, but this past week, President Trump said he'd love to have Putin back in the G8 which would make him again a peer global leader. President Trump floated inviting him to the U.S. or even visiting Russia himself. Do you think any of that is appropriate?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: It's more appropriate than not talking to him for the last two years, which is what President Biden did. Who did that help? It hasn't gotten us anywhere--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Talking is different than inviting him to the United States.",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Sure. I mean, you can parse it out however you like, but the reality is is you're going to have to get him to the table somehow, right? And there's a carrot and a stick approach. Trump can use a lot- you can use a lot of leverage, and then the Europeans need to use a lot more leverage. But you also have that carrot approach, and Trump is good at that. He's good at flattering people in order to get them to the table. That is what we need, whether we like it or not, that's what we need. That's what Ukraine needs. Ukraine cannot sustain this, no matter how much money we give them, cannot sustain this forever, and so it is in our interest to get him to that table and there's a variety of ways to do it, and I trust the president's at least doing a heck of a lot better job than anybody else. I don't see- I don't hear any other ideas, by the way, so this is what we're going with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But flattering, a very brutal dictator who's pretty cunning, frankly, you really think that's a winning strategy?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: He's not that cunning. He's fought a war that has destroyed his society, killed hundreds of thousands of Russians. He's made a massive mistake and miscalculation. He's not as clever as maybe we've given him credit for. I think, let Trump do his campaign promise and play this out. Look, nobody's going to take advantage of Donald Trump. And General Kellogg made that very clear, because that was a question Europeans asked him, you know, we- are you going to sell out just- just- just to get a deal? Just to get a deal that's because of the campaign promise? Kellogg just laughed at that. He's like, there is no way, there is absolutely no way that Donald Trump will be seen, and he will not let himself go down in history as having sold out to Putin. He will not let that happen. He believes- just for the sake of his own legacy, but he does care about lasting peace here, and lasting European peace. Again, my messaging, I'm not even talking to you right now, I'm talking to European leaders, you have to be uncomfortably aggressive against Putin in order to actually help us make this happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I think you know, some of the things Europeans point to is the fact that the United States cut out our allied government in Afghanistan from the negotiation Donald Trump cut with the Taliban. So there is a reason they point back to that and say, don't do this again. Don't cut Ukraine out of a negotiation with an enemy.",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Sure, I mean, and I criticized that decision too, but that's just not what's happening now. This is a vastly different situation. I just met with Zelenskyy last night. They're having very good conversations with our administration. The Ukrainians, I think, are very- the Europeans have all sorts of opinions. The Ukrainians, I think, are very optimistic as they should be. We've had some very good conversations, some very realistic conversations, and I'm very excited and optimistic about what can happen here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just because I raised Afghanistan to you, I want to ask you, you were one of the co-sponsors of the Afghan Adjustment Act, which was an effort to help bring some of those Afghans who helped the United States in its war in Afghanistan here to the United States for safety reasons. They are now stuck because of this Trump refugee ban. This is not just special immigrant visa holders. These are refugees writ large. Do you think the U.S. should continue to bring those Afghans to the U.S.?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Yeah, let's actually be really clear. The reason they're stuck is because Joe Biden pulled out of Afghanistan and had a zero troop policy despite every adviser telling him it was a terrible idea. That's why they're stuck. I still support bringing our allies back. I mean, to answer your question, it is obviously still a policy that I support, and we'll work with the administration to make it happen. I mean, look, I was blown up because one of my interpreters stepped on a- on an IED right in front of me. He died. He lost all four limbs. Died later that night. These are- these are patriots. They were fighting for- with us, alongside of us, for their own country, for our interests. Of course, actual allies need to be brought home. I think the unfortunate thing about that withdrawal is a lot of people who are not even our allies made it back on those flights, and then the people who are our allies, including U.S. citizens, were left behind. Again, we cannot blame Donald Trump for this. Donald Trump never left Afghanistan and we can say, well, he wanted to, well, he never did. That's the reality --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I'm just asking about the policy now.",
      "REP. CRENSHAW",
      "--So, we're going to work with the administration on this, and also, Congress still has to pass that. I mean\u00a0 --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REP. CRENSHAW",
      "--You know it's- there's- it goes beyond the the executive at this moment,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, when it comes to the military and military spending, the U.S. spends about 3.4 percent of its GDP on defense. Are you on board with boosting it to five percent which is what President Trump is saying western countries need to do? Are Republicans going to do that?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: It's- it's quite the target. Look, we've got a lot of work to do right now on- we've got a budget to pass, last year's budget. Government funding expires on March 14, so we got to deal with that. We got to deal with the debt ceiling. We've got to finance disaster aid for California wildfires. We've got a reconciliation bill coming up. Look, you look at- you look at the world at the moment, and where America stands and the investments we need to make, it's pretty obvious we need to increase defense spending, and the exact amount, of course, will get worked out in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Crenshaw, thank you for joining us.",

      "Some agencies have also been granted exemptions for a portion of their staff on the chopping block, as backlash has mounted over cuts at agencies like the Indian Health Service.",
      "Also not on the final list of cuts ordered by the Trump administration was the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, the agency's \"disease detectives,\" CBS News learned. Officials overseeing the fellowship had initially warned health departments and those in their ranks that they would be halved.",
      "Fellowship programs elsewhere in the agency were not as lucky. Officials said CDC's Public Health Associate Program, which places recent graduates in health departments throughout the country, was cut.",

    "summary": "The requests by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mark a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law.",
    "story": [
      "Signaling a major shift in civil rights enforcement, the federal agency that enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws has moved to dismiss six of its own cases on behalf of workers alleging gender identity discrimination, arguing that the cases now conflict with President Donald Trump's recent executive order, court documents say.",
      "The requests by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mark a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law, and a stark contrast to a decade ago when the agency\u00a0issued a landmark finding\u00a0that a transgender civilian employee of the U.S. Army had been discriminated against because her employer refused to use her preferred pronouns or allow her to use bathrooms based on her gender identity.",
      "Just last year, the EEOC\u00a0updated its guidance\u00a0to specify that deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, or refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, constituted a form of harassment. That followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.",
      "Nearly all workplace discrimination charges\u00a0must pass through the EEOC \u2014 at least initially \u2014 and the agency's decision to drop at least six of the cases raises serious questions about whether its protections will continue to extend to\u00a0transgender and gender nonconforming\u00a0people going forward.",
      "The EEOC is seeking to dismiss three cases in Illinois as well as one in Alabama, New York and California. In each instance, the original complaints allege discrimination against transgender or gender nonconforming workers. The agency cites Trump's Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \"immutable\" sexes \u2014 male and female \u2014 as the reason for why it no longer intends to pursue the cases.",
      "The Alabama case charged that Harmony Hospitality LLC discriminated against an employee who identifies as a gay nonbinary male by firing him hours after co-owners learned of his gender identity. The New York lawsuit alleged that Boxwood Hotels LLC fired a transgender housekeeper who complained that a supervisor repeatedly misgendered them and made anti-transgender statements, referring to the housekeeper as a \"transformer\" and \"it.\"",
      "Another suit alleged that Wendy's franchisee Starboard Group, Inc. subjected three transgender employees to pervasive sexual harassment at a Wendy's restaurant in Carbondale, Illinois, claiming a supervisor demanded to know if one employee had a penis. In another Illinois case, a transgender Reggio's Pizza cashier at Chicago O'Hare International Airport was \"outed\" by her manager, called a racist, homophobic slur by coworkers, and fired when she complained. In southern Illinois, at a hog farm called Sis-Bro, Inc., a coworker allegedly exposed his genitals to a transgender employee and touched her breasts.",
      "And in Santa Clara, California, the EEOC charged that a Lush Handmade Cosmetics store manager sexually harassed three gender nonconforming employees with \"offensive physical and verbal sexual conduct.\"",
      "Former EEOC General Counsel and Professor and Co-Dean Emeritus at Rutgers Law School David Lopez, who served in the agency for more than 20 years, on Friday said in his experience, the EEOC has never dismissed cases based on substance rather than merit \u2014 until now.",
      "For the country's anti-discrimination agency \"to discriminate against a group, and say, 'We're not going to enforce the law on their behalf' itself is discrimination, in my view,\" Lopez said. \"It's like a complete abdication of responsibility.\"",
      "The EEOC's requests to dismiss the cases come just weeks after Trump\u00a0dismissed two Democratic commissioners of the five-member EEOC before their terms expired, an unprecedented decision that removed what would have been a major obstacle to his administration efforts to upend interpretation of the nation's civil rights laws. Had the commissioners been allowed to carry out their terms, the EEOC would have had a Democratic majority well into Trump's term. The administration also fired Karla Gilbride as the EEOC's general counsel, replacing her with Andrew Rogers as acting counsel.",
      "Shortly after their dismissals, acting EEOC chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, signaled her intent to put the agency's resources behind enforcing Trump's executive order on gender. She announced in a statement that one of her priorities would be \"defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\" Later, she ordered that the EEOC would continue accepting any and all discrimination charges filed by workers, although complaints that \"implicate\" Trump's order should be elevated to headquarters for \"review.\"",
      "\"Biology is not bigotry. Biological sex is real, and it matters,\" Lucas said in her statement. \"Sex is binary (male and female) and immutable. It is not harassment to acknowledge these truths \u2014 or to use language like pronouns that flow from these realities, even repeatedly.\" She removed the agency's \"pronoun app,\" which allowed employees to display their pronouns in their Microsoft 365 profiles, among other changes.",
      "The EEOC in fiscal year 2023 received more than\u00a03,000 charges\u00a0alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, \"the most since the agency started tracking these charges in FY 2013, and up more than 36% from the previous year,\" according to the agency's website, which also provides a link for more information on discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. But the information appears to have been removed and the link now leads to a blank page with the message: \"The requested page could not be found.\"",
      "Jocelyn Samuels, one of the Democratic EEOC commissioners who was fired last month, said via email that Trump's executive order and the EEOC's response to it \"is truly regrettable.\"",
      "\"The Administration's efforts to erase trans people are deeply harmful to a vulnerable community and inconsistent with governing law,\" she said.",
      "Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal at LGBTQ+ rights group Human Rights Campaign, added in an emailed statement: \"This is the inevitable outcome when the EEOC is weaponized to greenlight discrimination against American workers.",
      "\"Instead of standing up for the rights of everyone to a workplace free from discrimination, including harassment and bias, the Trump administration is making it abundantly clear they will not protect working people.\"",

Today, El Salvador has the lowest homicide rate in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Starting in 2022, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador declared a state of exception, which empowered police and the military to arrest people on suspicion of gang affiliation, without any evidence of committing crimes. The state of exception has led to the imprisonment of more than 80,000 people, making El Salvador the country with the highest incarceration rate in the world, at 2%. But the crackdown has earned Bukele an approval rating of more than 90%.",

    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers have so far set the probability of a crash at around 2%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 2%, it's still around 98% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 2%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 2% is a 98% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 98% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "New images captured by NASA's Curiosity rover show colorful clouds in the sky over Mars.",
      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",
      "It also visited an impact crater nicknamed \"Rustic Canyon\" to take photos and study the rocks around the crater. The 67-foot wide crater likely formed millions of years ago, based on the erosion of the site, NASA said.",
      "The rover will continue on to a new location that includes what NASA called \"boxwork,\" or fractures in the planet's surface formed by groundwater. When seen from space, the fractures look like giant spiderwebs, NASA said.",

    "summary": "By switching the next space station crew to a different ferry ship, the Starliner astronauts will get home a bit earlier than planned.",
    "story": [
      "NASA plans to bring the two Starliner astronauts back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, around March 19-20, shortening their long-extended stay in orbit by about two weeks, the agency announced Tuesday.",
      "The slightly earlier-than-planned trip home was made possible by a tentative decision last week to switch the next set of station fliers \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as March 12, with weather and other factors considered.",
      "After a five-to-seven-day handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, will undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Assuming the dates hold up, Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week. That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA originally planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but late last year, another month was added to the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch.",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the two astronauts in space. He said he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams. Musk also blamed Biden in a post on X.",

    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers have so far set the probability of a crash at around 2%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 2%, it's still around 98% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",

    "summary": "The clouds contain carbon dioxide and only form high in Mars' atmosphere.",
    "story": [
      "New images captured by NASA's Curiosity rover show colorful clouds in the sky over Mars.",
      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",
      "It also visited an impact crater nicknamed \"Rustic Canyon\" to take photos and study the rocks around the crater. The 67-foot wide crater likely formed millions of years ago, based on the erosion of the site, NASA said.",
      "The rover will continue on to a new location that includes what NASA called \"boxwork,\" or fractures in the planet's surface formed by groundwater. When seen from space, the fractures look like giant spiderwebs, NASA said.",

    "title": "Asteroid's odds of hitting Earth go up as NASA tasked with studying it",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 09:13:58 -0500",
    "summary": "Astronomers will use the Webb telescope to closely monitor the size and trajectory of an asteroid that has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid has a small chance of hitting Earth less than eight years from now, and astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study it. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have increased slightly since then, according to the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say it currently carries a 2% risk of making contact with Earth when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "summary": "By switching the next space station crew to a different ferry ship, the Starliner astronauts will get home a bit earlier than planned.",
    "story": [
      "NASA plans to bring the two Starliner astronauts back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, around March 19-20, shortening their long-extended stay in orbit by about two weeks, the agency announced Tuesday.",
      "The slightly earlier-than-planned trip home was made possible by a tentative decision last week to switch the next set of station fliers \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as March 12, with weather and other factors considered.",
      "After a five-to-seven-day handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, will undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Assuming the dates hold up, Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week. That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA originally planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but late last year, another month was added to the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch.",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the two astronauts in space. He said he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams. Musk also blamed Biden in a post on X.",
      "But the Biden administration had no known influence on NASA's decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission, a plan that has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 spacecraft was launched with a two-man crew and two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "And in any case, there was no need to \"go get\" the astronauts given the Crew 9 spacecraft, the Starliner crew's ride home, has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov now plan to blast off around 7:48 p.m. EDT on March 12.",
      "The launch date depends on a variety of factors, including an on-schedule launch of a commercial moon lander from the same pad on Feb. 26 and, of course, the weather.",

      "After multiple rain delays that forced President Trump to leave the race before its conclusion, William Byron claimed his second straight Daytona 500 victory Sunday, surviving a string of late-race wrecks that knocked out a chunk of contenders and sent the Hendrick Motorsports driver into victory lane Sunday night at Daytona International Speedway.",
      "Ninth in the No. 24 Chevrolet with one lap left, Byron became the first back-to-back winner since Denny Hamlin in 2019-20.",
      "Bryon took advantage of another wreck on the final lap - NASCAR did not drop the caution and let the field race to the finish - and took another, familiar burnout in Daytona International Speedway.",
      "The 27-year-old Byron held on to win after two weather delays totaling more than 3 1/2 hours.",
      "Mr. Trump attended part of the race, calling it a unifying event with a spirit that will \"fuel America's Golden Age.\"",
      "In a presidential message released as he flew to Daytona Beach, Florida, Mr. Trump said the opening event of the NASCAR series brings together people from all walks of life in a \"shared passion for speed, adrenaline and the thrill of the race.\"",
      "\"From the roar of the engines on the track to the echo of 'The Star-Spangled Banner' soaring through the stands, the Daytona 500 is a timeless tribute to the speed, strength and unyielding spirit that make America great,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That spirit is what will fuel America's Golden Age, and if we harness it, the future is truly ours.\"",
      "The president said in his Jan. 20 inaugural address that \"the golden age of America begins right now.\"",
      "He thrilled thousands of NASCAR fans in the stands with an Air Force One flyover before landing next to Daytona International Speedway. Mr. Trump's presidential motorcade, with him riding in the limousine known as \"The Beast,\" did a lap around the racetrack when he arrived, and then led the drivers in several ceremonial pace laps before the start of the race.",
      "\"This is your favorite president. I'm a big fan, I'm a really big fan of you people,\" he told the drivers over the radio. \"How you do this, I don't know, but I just want you to be safe. You're talented people, and you're great people and great Americans. Have a good day, have a lot of fun and I'll see you later.\"",
      "Air Force One took off from Palm Beach International Airport shortly after noon and the president traveled with several guests, including his son Eric, grandson Luke, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and his wife, Kathryn, the White House said. Several members of Congress also traveled with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"The Great American Race\" was delayed Sunday for the sixth time in the last 14 years, a troubling trend for NASCAR. Heavy rain and wind up to 40 mph were forecast in the afternoon, and since the 2 1/2-mile speedway takes at least two hours to dry, drivers, crews and spectators braced for a long day.",
      "Mr. Trump left the race during what he said was \"a little rain delay, but we'll go home and watch it, I guess.\" By 5:25 p.m., after Mr. Trump landed back in West Palm Beach, NASCAR called for the drivers to return to their cars in an attempt to restart the event.",
      "The president\u00a0was at the race in 2020 while running for a second term and was given the honor of being grand marshal of NASCAR's biggest and most prestigious event of the year and delivered the command for drivers to start their engines.",
      "Last weekend, the Republican made history as the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. Mr. Trump also attends college football games and UFC fights and is an avid golfer.",
      "Asked what he enjoyed most about NASCAR, Mr. Trump said during a 2020 interview with Fox News that it was the bravery and courage of the drivers pursuing \"pure American glory.\"",
      "He described the Daytona 500 as a \"legendary display of roaring engines, soaring spirits and the American skill, speed and power that we've been hearing about for so many years. The tens of thousands of patriots here today have come for the fast cars and the world-class motorsports. But NASCAR fans never forget that no matter who wins the race, what matters most is God, family and country.''",
      "At the White House in 2018, Mr. Trump honored NASCAR Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. and Furniture Row Racing.",
      "Last May, as a former president and candidate for reelection, Mr. Trump attended the Coca-Cola 600  at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in the swing state of North Carolina.",
      "One NASCAR driver said having a president on hand Sunday for \"one of our biggest days of the year is special.\"",
      "\"It certainly brings a lot of eyes and a different perspective to what we do down here for this race,\" said Chase Elliott.",

      "This final one, which began after a 54-46 loss to North Carolina State on Dec. 3, 2020, had filled up the 18,000-seat arena game after game where people eagerly came to watch the Gamecocks pile up victories.",
      "They were there again Sunday, a sell-out at 18,000 strong, hoping to see the Gamecocks continue the program's record run.",
      "But it was Azzi Fudd, Sarah Strong and coach Geno Auriemma who used relentless defense and non-stop offense to end South Carolina's four-game win streak in the series.",
      "Fudd finished with 28 points off six 3-pointers while Strong, the nation's top incoming prospect this season, had 16 points and 13 rebounds.",

      "Staley also cited her team's lack of effort in the defeat, calling an \"F\" if her players were being graded in college.",
      "\"They had their way with us,\" Staley said. \"There's no trying to find a silver lining. We got beat and we got beat bad.\"",
      "Staley said it's important the Gamecocks get back to the habits on defense and offense that had them on a 22-1 start before losing two of their past three games.",

      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "We want to begin today with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is in Jerusalem on the second leg of his trip through Europe and the Middle East.",
      "Mr. Secretary, I know it's the evening hours there, and you've had a long day. We appreciate your time. You've got quite a busy schedule.",
      "You met earlier with Prime Minister Netanyahu. He said he's lockstep with the Trump administration, but he can't share details on \u2013 quote \u2013 \"when the gates of hell will be open if all our hostages are not released.\"",
      "Did he tell you he wants to keep talks going to get to phase two of this hostage deal?",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Well, I think we share a common goal. We want to see every hostage released.",
      "Frankly, I think \u2013 and the president has said this \u2013 we want to see them out as soon as we possibly can. And \u2013 and, certainly, you know, the world has watched these images of people \u2013 and it's just heartbreaking to remember that some of them have been now almost two years there. It's a horrifying situation.",
      "So we coordinate and work very close with them. We share the goal that every hostage needs to come home, every single one, without delay. Obviously, the \u2013 there are details of how we're pursuing that and coordinating that we're not going to share publicly because we don't want to endanger the hostages and we don't want to endanger this process.",
      "But suffice it to say that, if it was up to us, every one of these hostages would be home right now, and we want it to happen as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, the deal stands?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Again, we want every hostage out as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We will \u2013 and we want to see them home.",
      "There are some that are supposed to \u2013 under the deal, there are some that are supposed to be released coming up next weekend. We expect that to happen, but we'd like to see them all come out. We're not going to \u2013 we're not in favor of waiting weeks and weeks.",
      "Now, that may be the process that's in place because of the deal, but we would like to see them all out as soon as possible, and we continue to coordinate. And that \u2013 that's what we'd like to see as the outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Who wouldn't want all these hostages to be home and with their families?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Want to ask you about Iran as well. President Trump has said he wants a diplomatic deal with Iran. Are you reaching out to them? And alongside that, does the U.S. support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran to take out its nuclear program?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, Israel will always have to act in what they believe is their national interest and their national defense.",
      "And so I'm not going to speak about whatever strategies they may have on this or any other topic. I will say that we don't have any outreach from Iran. We haven't seen any. And, ultimately, we've seen in the past that efforts that Iran has undertaken diplomatically have been only about how to extend the time frame that \u2013 but continue to enrich and re \u2013 and \u2013 and in addition to sponsor terrorism, in addition to build these long-range weapons, in addition to sow instability throughout the region.",
      "But let's be clear. There's been zero outreach or interest to date from Iran about any negotiated deal. Ideally, yes, I would love to wake up one day and hear the news that Iran has decided not to pursue a nuclear weapon, not to sponsor terrorism, and reengage in the world as a \u2013 as a \u2013 as a normal government.",
      "We've had no indication of any of that, not just now, but for 30 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you head from Israel to Saudi Arabia next. I know you'll be talking about Gaza, but we've also learned that Saudi Arabia is trying to facilitate this diplomacy with Russia about Ukraine.",
      "Which Russian officials do you expect to be meeting with? And what will the focus of your talks there be? Do you actually believe Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate and make concessions?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, here's what I know.",
      "I know President Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin last week. And, in it, Vladimir Putin expressed his interest in peace, and the president expressed his desire to see an end to this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and that was an enduring peace, not that we're going to have another invasion in three or four years.",
      "That's a good call. Now, obviously, it has to be followed up by action. So, the next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not. Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace. One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one.",
      "But I can tell you that Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could potentially begin that process. Other leaders have tried. They have not been able to do so. When he ran in his campaign and he was elected as president, one of his promises was, he would work to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's sustainable and fair.",
      "And, obviously, you know, this is the first step in that process, but we have a long ways to go. Again, one call doesn't make it. One meeting wouldn't make it. This \u2013 there's a lot of work to be done. But I \u2013 I thought it has \u2013 you know, even the longest journey begins with the first step.",
      "So we'll see what happens from here, hopefully good things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will you be meeting with?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, nothing's been finalized yet. I was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia anyways.",
      "We invited \u2013 we announced that trip a week ago, and \u2013 a week-and-a-half ago. So, ultimately, look, if at any point in time there's an opportunity to continue the work that President Trump started last week to begin to create an opening for a broader conversation, that it would involve Ukraine and would involve the end of the war, and would involve our allies all over the world, particularly in Europe, we're going to explore it, if that opportunity presents itself.",
      "I don't have any details for you this morning, other than to say that we stand ready to follow the president's lead on this and begin to explore ways, if those opportunities present itself, to begin a process towards peace.",
      "Now, a process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing. This war has been going on for a while.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's difficult. It's complicated. It's been bloody. It's been costly. So it will not be easy to end the conflict in this.",
      "And there are other parties at stake that have opinions on this as well. The European Union has sanctions as well. The Ukrainians are obviously fighting this war. It's their country, and they're on the front lines. So, one meeting isn't going to solve it.",
      "But I want to reiterate the president made clear he wants to end this war, and if opportunities present themselves to further that, we're going to take them if they present themselves. We'll see what happens over the next few days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, Keith Kellogg, who is the envoy appointed to help with these talks, says these are going to be parallel negotiations, meaning the Ukrainians and Russians aren't talking to each other yet.",
      "When you meet with your Russian counterpart, whoever that is, are you going to be sitting there arguing Ukraine's position?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think that we have to understand is, right now, there is no process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: What \u2013 what we have right now is a call between Putin and President Trump in which both sides expressed an interest in ending this conflict.",
      "I imagine there will be follow-up conversations to figure out what a process to talk about that would look like. And then, at that point, perhaps we can begin to share more details. So it's a bit premature. I know there's been a lot of reaction to it, because there's been no conversation about it, any serious conversation.",
      "But I want to go back to the point I made. President Trump ran. He was very clear. He thinks this war needs to end. And if he sees an opportunity to end it, which is what he's looking for, whether there is an opportunity or not, we're going to pursue it.",
      "Ultimately, it will reach a point when you are \u2013 if it's real negotiations, and we're not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they're the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they're the \u2013 they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and \u2013 and they've contributed to this effort.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We're just not there yet. We really aren't, but hopefully we will be, because we'd all like to see this war end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No doubt.",
      "The last administration did have contact through the intelligence agencies with Russia, but they didn't believe there was any proof that Vladimir Putin was interested in talks. You know the history with Vladimir Putin. He likes to use diplomacy as a cover to distract while he continues to wage war.",
      "Do you trust that this time is different?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I don't think, in geopolitics, anyone should trust anyone. I think these things have to be verified through actions.",
      "I said yesterday that peace is not a noun. It's a verb. It's an action. You have to take concrete steps towards it. What I can tell you is, I know of no better negotiator in American politics than President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't \u2013 I think President Trump will know very quickly whether to say, is this a real thing or whether this is an effort to buy time.",
      "But I don't want to prejudge that. I don't want to foreclose the opportunity to end a conflict that's already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands and continues every single day to be increasingly a war of attrition on both sides.",
      "I think everyone should be celebrating the fact that we have an American president that is seeking to promote peace in the world, not start wars, but end them, in a way that's enduring.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's something we should be happy about. Whether it's possible or not, we're certainly willing, but it's not entirely up to us, obviously, but we'll find out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did speak in a phone call with Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov. The Russian side claimed that you discussed restoring trade, which seemed to be a nod to sanctions, easing restrictions on diplomats, and other gestures like a high-level leaders meeting.",
      "Are you actually considering, is the Trump administration considering lifting sanctions on Russia?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, the phone call was to establish communications that are consistent with the call the president made last week with Vladimir Putin, because if we are \u2013 if there is going to be the possibility of \u2013 of progress here towards peace, we are going to need to talk to the Russians.",
      "I mean, that is going to have to happen, and we're going to have to be able to be able to do it across our channels.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: About lifting sanctions, though?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I also raised in that conversation concerns that \u2013 well, we didn't go into any details.",
      "I mean, what we just discussed is basically the ability to begin communicating. I had never spoken to Mr. Lavrov in my life, so it was an opportunity for us to begin to open that channel of communication, which, again, if there's the potential for peace here, that's a channel that has to exist.",
      "But let me add one more thing. I also raised the issue of our embassy in Moscow, which operates under very difficult conditions. I raised that because it's important. It's going to be very difficult to engage in communication with Russia about anything if our embassy is not functioning. And he raised concerns about his diplomatic mission in the United States.",
      "So, at a very basic level, if, in fact, there is going to be an opportunity here to pursue peace by engaging with the Russians, we're going to need to have functional embassies in Moscow and in Washington, D.C., and that's certainly something foreign ministers would talk about as a matter of normal course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what happened in Munich, Germany, at the Security Conference.",
      "Vice President Vance gave a speech, and he told U.S. allies that the threat he worries about the most is not Russia. It is not China. He called it the threat from within, and he lectured about what he described as censorship, mainly focusing, though, on including more views from the right.",
      "He also met with the leader of a far-right party known as the AfD, which, as you know, is under investigation and monitoring by German intelligence because of extremism. What did all of this accomplish, other than irritating our allies?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Why would our allies or anybody be irritated by free speech and by someone giving their opinion?",
      "We are, after all, democracies. The Munich \u2013 Munich Security Conference is largely a conference of democracies, in which one of the things that we cherish and value is the ability to speak freely and provide your opinions.",
      "And so I think if anyone's angry about his words, they don't have to agree with him, but to be angry about it, I think, actually makes his point. I thought it was actually a pretty historic speech. Whether you agree with him or not, I think the valid points he's making to Europe is, we are concerned that the true values that we share, the values that bind us together with Europe are things like free speech and democracy and our shared history in winning two World Wars and defeating Soviet communism and the like.",
      "These are the values that we shared in common. And, in that Cold War, we fought against things like censorship and oppression and so forth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And when you see backsliding, and you raise that, that's a very valid concern.",
      "We can't tell them how to run their countries. We are \u2013 he simply expressed in a speech his view of it, which a lot of people, frankly, share. And I thought he said a lot of things in that speech that needed to be said. And, honestly, I don't know why anybody would be upset about it.",
      "People are allowed \u2013 you know, you don't have to agree on someone's speech. I happen to agree with a lot of what he said, but you don't have to agree with someone's speech to \u2013 to at least appreciate the fact they have a right to say it and that you should listen to it and see whether those criticisms are valid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I assure you, the United States has come under withering criticism on many occasions from many leaders in Europe, and we don't go around throwing temper tantrums about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide.",
      "And he met with the head of a political party that has far right views and some historic ties to extreme groups. The context of that was changing the tone of it. And you know that, that the censorship was specifically about the right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I have to disagree with you. No, I have \u2013 I have to disagree with you.",
      "Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal because they hated Jews and they hated minorities and they hated those that they \u2013 they had a list of people they hated, but primarily the Jews. There was no free speech in Nazi Germany. There was none.",
      "There was also no opposition in Nazi Germany. They were a sole and only party that governed that country. So that's not an accurate reflection of history.",
      "I also think it's wrong \u2013 again, I go back to the point of his speech. The point of his speech was basically that there is an erosion in free speech and intolerance for opposing points of view within Europe, and that's of concern, because that is eroding. That's not an erosion of your military capabilities. That's not an erosion of your economic standing.",
      "That's an erosion of the actual values that bind us together in this transatlantic union that everybody talks about. And I think allies and friends and partners that have worked together now for 80 years should be able to speak frankly to one another in open forums without being offended, insulted, or upset.",
      "And I spoke to Foreign Ministers from multiple countries throughout Europe. Many of them probably didn't like the speech or didn't agree with it, but they were continuing to engage with us on all sorts of issues that unite us.",
      "So, again, at the end of the day, I think that, you know, people give all - - that is a forum in which you're supposed to be inviting people to give speeches, not basically a chorus where everyone is saying the exact same thing. That's not always going to be the case when it's a collection of democracies where leaders have the right and the privilege to speak their minds in forums such as these.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I'm told that we are out of time. A lot to get through with you. We appreciate you making time today.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to the economy and inflation, which, compared to last January, ticked up about 3 percent last week.",
      "Kevin Hassett is the director of the National Economic Council, and he joins us now. Good morning to you, Director.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, National Economic Council): Good morning, Margaret. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you, but the rest of the country saw their egg prices at the grocery store go up. We're now at a record high due to that bird flu outbreak, but also labor costs, and that's contributing to food costs overall.",
      "When will the administration get that outbreak under control?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "Well, what's going on, right, as you know, is that there is an inflation problem that's very large. We saw the Consumer Price Index come out, and we found out that the stagflation that was created by the policies of President Biden was way worse than we thought.",
      "Over the last three months, across all goods, including eggs, the average inflation rate was 4.6 percent, way above target, and an acceleration at the end of the Biden term.",
      "And, you know, this is really not just us. You could go look at Jason Furman, Larry Summers, economic advisers of President Biden kept saying, don't do this. You're going to cause massive inflation. In fact, Jason Furman has a very thought-provoking peace in \"Foreign Affairs\" right now calling the Biden economic record a tragedy.",
      "And this is them, not us, right? It's \u2013 so, now we've got a lot of things that we're doing to get ahold of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about fiscal spending there.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me. Yes, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking about fiscal spending there. But\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, where does inflation come from, right? And so what we're doing now is, we've \u2013 we've got, really, a multi-multi-faceted plan to end inflation.",
      "And I will go quickly, because I want to end with what we're doing with egg prices. But we're going to have a macroeconomic change that has supply-side tax cuts, so we have more supply, and we're going to reduce government spending, both through what DOGE is doing, and through congressional action.",
      "And so, therefore, the macroeconomic forces that Jason Furman said were a tragedy are going to be reversed. That's a good thing. Then we're also going to have a lot of energy production, a lot of deregulation. And then, finally, when needed, we're going to focus on the individual thing-by-thing pieces.",
      "And so, for example, you mentioned avian flu. President Biden didn't really have a plan for avian flu. Well, Brooke Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week on what we're going to do with avian flu.",
      "In fact, I was editing the thing with them tomorrow. But \u2013 but the final thing \u2013 and then I will give it back to you. I promise not to filibuster.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The question is, like, why did we do this? Why did we do this? That's what everybody's talking about.",
      "But the thing that I always start with when I'm looking at what we're doing, what the president wants us to do, is, why did they do that? Why did they do that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And \u2013 and there are too many times where it feels like nobody thought about that in the press, or maybe\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, gosh.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 the left wing economists. Why did they do that? Why did Biden print so much money and cause so much inflation? Why did he do it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, Kevin.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That's \u2013 that's what I'm thinking about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin, you know, we talked about that on Face the Nation quite a lot. Quite a lot.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't want \u2013 mean to criticize you. OK, good for you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, next week, we'll see the plan on how to get avian flu \u2013 how to get bird flu, under\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I could talk about it right now if you'd like to, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sure. What \u2013 what is the plan? Are you going to - - what are you going to do?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, so \u2013 so, again, the \u2013 the Biden plan was to just, you know, kill chickens. And they spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken.",
      "And so you go \u2013 I just went to the grocery store. I shop for our family, in part because I love to look at prices. And there were no eggs at the store yesterday, just a few. And \u2013 and so that happened because they killed all the chickens.",
      "And so what we need to do is have better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on, to make sure that the perimeter doesn't have to kill the chickens, have a better, smarter perimeter. And so having a smart perimeter is what we're working on. And we're finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government.",
      "And that's the kind of thing that should have happened a year ago. And if it had, then egg prices would be, you know, a lot better than they are now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But the avian flu is a real thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And, by the way, it's spread mostly by ducks and geese. And so think about it. They're killing chickens to stop the spread, but chickens don't really fly. The \u2013 the spread is happening from the geese and the ducks.",
      "And so why does it make any sense to have a big perimeter of dead chickens, when it's the \u2013 the ducks and the geese that are spreading it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Department of Agriculture policy has been to kill those chickens, as you know.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we'll watch the details of that.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But let's get back to something the president said.",
      "Higher interest rates, as you know, are part of that battle against inflation that the Federal Reserve has been waging. But, this past week, the president called for interest rates to be lowered. Why does he think that's going to lower your grocery prices?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, I \u2013 I want to say that I, just this weekend, have arranged to begin once again regular lunches with Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve.",
      "And Jay and I have a long and collegial relationship. And I'm going to go over there with him and the other governors. So we're going to talk about our views about what's going on, and listen to his. And that collegiality has been going on for four years when I was here before, and the president very much values that.",
      "I think that the \u2013 the thing about\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not to influence?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 lower interest rates \u2013 no, I'm going to talk about \u2013 well, Jay is going to \u2013 Jay is an independent person.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The Fed independence is respected. And \u2013 and the point is, the president's opinion is also \u2013 can be heard. He's the president of the United States.",
      "But here's the thing that I think is interesting, that if we get inflation under control, then that takes the pressure off the Fed. And one way to tell whether markets think, are we getting inflation under control, is to look at longer-term interest rates that the Fed doesn't affect directly.",
      "And if you look at it, the 10-year Treasury rate has dropped about 40 basis points\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 over the last couple of weeks while we announced our plan to control inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That saved the American people about $40 billion, about $40 billion, just from talking about the stuff that we're about to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That's pretty good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but the president's statement contradicts economic policy. As you know\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No. Inflation \u2013 no. Inflation rates are already \u2013 I'm saying the interest rates are already lower by 40 basis points. So, Interest rates are lower. The one that matters\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're briefing the president on it. OK.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 the most for the economy is maybe the 5- or 10- year rate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Those the ones that matter the most. And those are down already. So the president's right about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we run out of time, I really want to make sure I get to you on tariffs.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: OK, sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there's concern that that will add to prices.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they'll be added on to consumers and what they pay.",
      "How are these reciprocal tariffs going to work? The president was tweeting he wants to put them on, like, 175 different countries that have a VAT tax, a value-added tax.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, we're talking to leaders of other countries all the time.",
      "Last night, into the wee hours of their morning and kind of a late night for me, I was talking to Minister Reynolds from the U.K. about this very matter. But here's the way I would like to think about it, that, right now, U.S. companies are spending \u2013 are paying foreign governments about $370 billion a year in tax, and foreign companies are paying the U.S. government about $57 billion in tax.",
      "And a lot of it is because of the VAT. But if we didn't have to pay the foreign governments tax, over 10 years, it'd be about $5 trillion of tax that U.S. citizens don't have to pay. That would more than pay for the tax cuts that we're debating right now.",
      "And so if we get some of that money back, either through tariffs, or for \u2013 obviously, if they reduce the tariffs of that, then that's good for Americans. It's going to put more money in their pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And \u2013 and that's what President Trump is \u2013 is trying to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, I would like to have you come back, sit at the table\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Always.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and talk through this in \u2013 in more detail at another time. We have to leave it there for today.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Thanks. Happy \u2013 happy to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Take care.",

      "The Munich Security Conference is an annual gathering of heads of state and international security policymakers. It's one of the biggest conferences. And one of the biggest topics this year was the war in Ukraine.",
      "We spoke to two lawmakers earlier from Munich, including House Intelligence Committee Republican Dan Crenshaw. We asked him about President Zelenskyy's views regarding what's needed in a potential peace deal.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that he has asked not just for continued military support now, but security assurances in the event of a peace deal. What can you tell him about what to expect from America?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Well, I just - I just came from a lunch where General Kellogg spoke. He's the special envoy leading this effort to establish peace. And he's very clear that the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace, which, of course, involves security assurances.",
      "And part of that process is figuring out exactly what that means. Even the Ukrainians are talking about what that means. There's a variety of options, per se.",
      "I think the Europeans have to play a huge role in that. One of the things that gets talked about a lot is where do - European forces actually acting as a peacekeeping force.",
      "The Ukrainians clearly have a seat at the table and then the United States will be the intermediary as we try to establish a peace deal.",
      "But the Europeans need to demand a seat at the table by being uncomfortably aggressive, which is something they haven't done. You should be threatening things to Putin that actually make you uncomfortable because that's how - that's the only language Putin speaks is power. And when General Kellogg is at that table with Putin, he's only got a finite amount of leverage. And there's only so much more leverage that the U.S. can - can impose. And if anybody can do it, I think it's Donald Trump. And he's already - he's already said that, that nothing is off the table. Vice President Vance said that, nothing is off the table, economic, military. They will use the amount of leverage they can.",
      "My message to European leaders is, if we want to win, if we want a better outcome for Ukraine at the end of these peace talks, you need to be uncomfortably aggressive. You need to, not just bolster your own defense spending, I mean because that's a long-term issue, that's a long-term investment -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You need to be talking about where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground. Stop following our lead and actually take the lead. Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There already is a military security alliance known as NATO. You are saying you think there should be something else or some other entity providing security assurances for Ukraine?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: European soldiers. I mean, look, Europeans send aid, right? They send weapons. They do the same things we do. They - they - they match it, barely. My argument to them is you shouldn't be matching it, you should be doubling it. You should be tripling it. It's your continent.",
      "Zelenskyy had a - gave a speech today. He talked about a European army, right? So, there's - there's a lot of talk about this. Of course, there's NATO. That's - that's a security - that's a - that's a defensive alliance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: That's - that's - that's some - that's not an army. That's - they did this - we're talking about different things here.",
      "The Europeans need to come together, in my opinion, and have just a much stronger message towards Putin instead of finger wagging at us about what we're willing to give or not give in a peace deal.",
      "Again, I tell them, look, if you want a seat at the table, earn it. The Ukrainians have earned it. The Ukrainians have impressed everybody for the last three years. They've fought valiantly and courageously. They've earned my respect. They earned that seat at the table. We need to listen to their - to what they want. We listened to Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. You said that both President Trump and Vice President Vance were clear, nothing is off the table. However, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, did seem, in Brussels, to take things quite explicitly off the table. He said the U.S. does not want Ukraine in NATO and that Ukraine would not return to its pre-2014 borders, which acknowledges giving up some of Crimea and potentially the east.",
      "Do you think offering concessions before negotiations begin is a good strategy here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Yes, the - I think you have to listen to the White House as a whole. They walked - they walked those back and -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And - and made it clear that nothing is off the - nothing is off the table. So, no, you walk into a negotiation with everything on the table and I think that's exactly what this White House is doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's less than a month since this administration has been in power and they want to move fast. And everybody's a little nervous. But I think they should be much more optimistic than they should be nervous.",
      "You needed a seismic shift here. This was not a sustainable operation in Ukraine. If Kamala Harris had been president, you'd be going along the same lines, which is basically funding this war until every Ukrainian is dead. That's not an end that we can accept.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: There has to be some talk of negotiation. And I'll remind the American people, too, from our perspective, from American strategic deterrent's perspective, even getting Putin to that table to talk about an end to the war is -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Is a massive strategic win for us because it establishes back our deterrents over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, do you know that he is actually committing to come to the table? We don't have a commitment to actually negotiate from Vladimir Putin.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: No, we don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You know what would be really helpful? What I said before, if the EU was uncomfortably aggressive about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Got it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Again, Putin only responds to power. And this is - this is what I remind western leaders here, too. Western - westerners don't speak that language. Westerns talk about negotiations and, you know, and good moral values that we share and we believe each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: That's not how the east works. They only respond to power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, OK, on that point, Vladimir Putin, it sounds like you would agree, is an accused war criminal. He is a dictator. There is a warrant out for his arrest, as you know. He invaded Ukraine. He is clearly a U.S. adversary.",
      "But this past week President Trump said he'd love to have Putin back in the G-8, which would make him, again, a peer global leader. President Trump floated inviting him to the U.S. or even visiting Russia himself. Do you think any of that is appropriate?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's more appropriate than not talking to him for the last two years, which is what President Biden did. Who did that help? It hasn't - it hasn't gotten us anywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Talking is different than inviting him to the United States.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Right. Sure. I mean, you can parse it out however you like. But the reality is, is you're going to have to get him to the table somehow, right? And there's a carrot and a stick approach. Trump can use a lot - can use a lot of leverage. And then the Europeans can use a lot more leverage. But you also have that carrot approach. And Trump is good at that. He's good at flattering people in order to get them to the table. That is what we need. Whether we like it or not, that's what we need.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But flattering a very brutal dictator who is pretty cunning, frankly, you really think that's a winning strategy?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: I mean, he's not that cunning. He's fought a - it was a war that has destroyed his society, killed hundreds of thousands of Russians. He's made a massive mistake and miscalculation. He's not - he's not as clever as maybe we are giving him credit for.",
      "I think let Trump do his campaign promise and play this out. Look, nobody is going to take advantage of Donald Trump. And General Kellogg made that very clear because that was a question Europeans asked him, you know, are we - are you going to sell out just to get a deal, just to get a deal because of the campaign promise. Kellogg just laughed at that. He's like, there is no way. There is absolutely no way that Donald Trump will be seen - he will not let himself go down in history as having sold out to Putin. He will not let that happen. He believes - just for the sake of his own legacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But he does care about lasting peace here and lasting European peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I think you know some of the things Europeans point to is the fact that the United States cut out our allied government in Afghanistan from the negotiation Donald Trump cut with the Taliban. They point back to that and say, don't do this again.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Sure. And I criticized that decision, too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But that's just not what's happening now. This is a vastly different situation. I mean Europeans have all sorts of opinions. The Ukrainians, I think, are very optimistic, as they should be. We've had some very good conversations. Some very realistic conversations. And I'm very excite and optimistic about what can happen here.",

      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of negotiations, there were some comments made by President Trump this week. The defense secretary said returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is unrealistic. He's suggesting that maybe the east and another part of Ukraine and Crimea will be taken by Russia. Why do you think there was this plan to give concessions before talks begin?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-NH): Well, I think it was a mixed message coming from the administration. On the one hand you heard Secretary Hegseth saying they were going to take NATO off the table, that Ukraine needed to give up territory, and on the other hand you had Vice President Vance saying that everything should be on the table, including the possibility of putting boots on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "So, it's a mixed message. I hope that the upshot of that is that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of what Congress can do, are your hands tied here or are some of your Republican colleagues willing to put something, perhaps, in an upcoming defense bill, for example, that might help Ukraine?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think that's one option. One of the things that we're talking about doing right away is making some statements on the - the repossession of assets by Russia that are held in the United States and in Europe and the importance of having those assets go to Ukraine to help both with the execution of the military conflict, but also to think about rebuilding.",
      "Again, there's bipartisan support. There was bipartisan support for the bill and there's bipartisan support to continue to try and ensure that those assets from Russia get repaid to Ukraine because Russia is really the aggressor here and we need to hold Vladimir Putin accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, your Republican counterpart, Roger Wicker, he is the chair of the Armed Services Committee, was really sharp in his comments at Munich. He was saying, he was puzzled, he was disturbed by what the defense secretary, a member of his own party, had said about Ukraine. He was very clear that what Vladimir Putin is doing, he said, is absolutely out of Adolf Hitler's playbook. Those are sharp words considering the president of the United States says he wants to meet face-to-face to Vladimir Putin and possibly bring him to the White House.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, they are sharp words and they are very much justified. Regardless of what President Trump may be doing to try and lay the groundwork for any future negotiations, the fact is there is strong bipartisan support in Congress to help Ukraine in this unfair war that Russia has initiated. And I think Senator Wicker's comments are very important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At the conference you're at, you were able to speak with European leaders. What are they saying to you about their view of America now?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, we had a chance to meet with representatives from Britain, from Canada, not a European country but also very concerned about Ukraine, with people from the Balkan countries, with President Zelenskyy, obviously. And there is a great deal of concern about the U.S. position on Ukraine.",
      "At the panel that we had with President Zelenskyy, we talked about the importance of Europe and the United States acting in concert so that we can hold Putin accountable with sanctions so that we can - so that there is no daylight between the United States and our NATO allies and our European allies. Clearly that's what Vladimir Putin has been trying to do throughout this conflict, and we need to make it clear that that is not going to happen, that we are going to work together, and we are going to support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does Congress need to be any part of approving this deal President Trump says he wants to take possession of some of the critical minerals that Ukraine has inside their territory? He says he wants to use that as sort of repayment for what the U.S. has spent on weapons.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think there are some benefits to having the United States have some investments in Ukraine. That's part of what a critical minerals deal would do. It's not at all clear who - who has possession of those critical minerals. Some of them are in the eastern part of Ukraine where Russia controls the territory. Some of them are owned by private - actually oligarchs. There are several oligarchs who own a number of those critical mineral sites. So, I think those are details that have not yet been worked out and I have not seen the agreement that's been put in front of President Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know Zelenskyy will be discussing that with other members of the administration. We'll stay tuned on that. But I do want to bring up something that we -",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: One of the things that, in our conversations with President Zelenskyy, President Zelenskyy reiterated nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week seven federal prosecutors resigned in objection after the Justice Department directed them to drop the investigation into New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing charges, including bribery and conspiracy. In her resignation letter, Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney overseeing the case, said a dismissal amounted to a quid pro quo and that the DOJ, quote, \"proposes dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws.\"",
      "In response, then Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove threatened her with an investigation into her conduct.",
      "Joining us now is Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin. He's the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "This episode is highly unusual. Is there anything that you, in your role, can do about this episode and what's happening inside Attorney General Bondi's Justice Department?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, the Justice Department is at war with its own attorneys, its own prosecutors. And the whole episode is just saturated with corruption. It was a corruption prosecution and investigation, which led to a grand jury indictment against Eric Adams for bribery, conspiracy, other corruption charges. And then the new Department of Justice decided to squash the whole thing, basically saying to Adams, well, we will drop this case against you if you engage in certain kinds of political or policy accommodations with us.",
      "And then, in order to complete that deeply corrupt bargain, they had to try to coerce their own lawyers to do it. But, of course, the prosecutors were saying, nothing has changed in the facts of the case and nothing has changed in the law. In fact, additional evidence was found, meaning that they were going to revise and expand the original indictment, but instead they were told to kill it for political reasons.",
      "And so, you know, this is an outrageous violation of the rules of prosecutors and an offense against due process in a very dangerous first move for the Department of Justice to be making under the Trump people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Adams, of course, claims there was no quid pro quo and that none of this was wrong, but there was the lead prosecutor, as well, on this case who resigned in objection to what's happening. But it's moving forward here. This is all now in the hands of a judge. Does he have leeway to prosecute?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: So, first of all, just about Danielle Sassoon. I mean that's a very conservative U.S. attorney, and she couldn't take it. I mean you have the most conservative prosecutors in the country resigning in opposition to this steam roller on behalf of corruption. But it's not over yet because Judge Dale Ho does not have to accept the withdrawal of the charges, the dismissal of the charges, which seven Department of Justice attorneys resigned rather than be involved in. The head of the public integrity section, the head of the criminal division, five other lawyers said, no way, and they wrote very stinging rebukes of the attorney general and the Department of Justice in this case.",
      "So, Judge Ho has to accept this dismissal, but he may not. He may go ahead and try to appoint another prosecutor to go ahead and, you know, go through with the indictment that was handed down by a grand jury.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Attorney General Bondi says there's nothing wrong here, saying it was President Biden's weaponized DOJ that went after Adams for political reasons, and only after he criticized President Biden's immigration policies.",
      "This is a fellow Democrat. Do you think he should be prosecuted? And how do you respond to that allegation?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, first of all, the attorney general did not cite any changes in the facts of the case. She did not cite any changes in the law, because neither occurred, nor did she cite any irregularities in the investigation or the prosecution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She's saying it's all made up.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, then she's - she's mimicking her boss then, who just lies as a matter of course. One would expect more from the attorney general of the United States.",
      "And, you know, this whole corruption attack that is an attack on the Department of Justice for engaging in corruption prosecutions could be impeachable in a different political environment. But the fact that Mayor Adams is a Democrat is neither here nor there for me. I'm against corruption across the board. It seems like Donald Trump wants to attract all of the corrupt politicians in America to his side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in the Oval Office President Trump - you may have seen this image - he has hung a picture, a framed picture of the front page of \"The New York Post,\" that has his mugshot in it from that criminal case in New York. Yesterday he also tweeted, \"he who saves his country does not violate any law.\"",
      "He seems to believe that all those prosecutions against him were politically motivated and voters apparently didn't think it mattered. He was elected with a mandate. How do you convince the public that it does matter?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: The dominant objective of this administration is corruption and lawlessness. The first thing that they did was they sacked 17 inspectors general. Those are the people who are actual corruption fighters within the departments and agencies. These are the people who ferreted out $91 billion worth of waste, fraud and abuse in the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They argue it's within their political power to do so.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Oh, it - there's no doubt it is, but they sacked them. Actually, it's not within their political power to do so in a lawless way. They have to notify Congress first, 30 days in advance, and they have to set forth the specific reasons for why an inspector general is being fired. They never did that.",
      "And the reason, of course, is because they want to pursue agendas of corruption across the board. They're saying they're not going to enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. They are shutting down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has saved American consumers $31 million in bank overdraft charges, credit card late fees from corporations completely inflated and having nothing to do with the actual charges and so on. They're getting rid of anything in the government that supports consumers, that supports citizens against the rip-off artists who are their friends.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's little Democrats can do to push back because you don't have any political power.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we're winning in court. More than a dozen federal injunctions and temporary restraining orders have been issued against everything from their illegal seizure of computer data and every Americans' private data at the Treasury Department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: To their illegal attempt to ban birthright citizenship in America.",

      "Last week, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo that instructed prosecutors in Manhattan to abandon the indictment that charged Adams with\u00a0bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations, which he denied. Bove justified the decision by saying the case \"has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.\" He also alleged that the prosecution was politically motivated due to Adams' criticism of the Biden administration.",
      "The directive prompted a revolt at the Justice Department that burst into public view when Danielle Sassoon, the acting head of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, resigned in protest rather than file a motion seeking to drop the case. She was soon joined by other top Justice Department officials. Different prosecutors ultimately filed a motion late Friday to abandon the charges.",
      "Sassoon alleged in her resignation letter that the Justice Department proposed dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws. Adams' attorney denied that he offered to help enact the president's deportation agenda in exchange for having his case dropped, saying the mayor's team \"offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us.\" In response to Sassoon's resignation, Bove also denied there was any quid pro quo, writing in a letter that Sassoon's allegation was \"false.\"",

      "\"Stop following our lead and actually take the lead,\" Crenshaw said. \"Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation, and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin.\"",

      "The sprawling Black Beauty Ranch, in East Texas, takes its name from the classic 1877 novel. Narrated by a horse, \"Black Beauty\" encouraged readers see the world from an animal's point of view.",
      "\"The story of 'Black Beauty' is about coming home, and feeling free and safe, and so, this is what all these animals get to do,\" said Kitty Block, the CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, the non-profit which funds Black Beauty as a sanctuary.",
      "On its 1,400 acres, there are zebras and macaques, bison and lions. \"They've all come from various rescue situations,\" said Block. \"Each one has an incredible story.\"",
      "There's Loki the tiger, rescued from someone's garage in Houston. There's Eve, known as the \"bare bear,\" who was once so hairless and emaciated that rescuers initially didn't know what she was.",
      "Block showed us a group of lemurs: \"These guys were in a very dark, small place, did not have anything that resembled this kind of life. So, it's amazing to see them, how they've taken to their habitat.\"",
      "The ranch's first residents were wild donkeys, airlifted from the Grand Canyon by Black Beauty's founder, the author, critic and animal rights activist Cleveland Amory.",
      "Today the sanctuary is home to 150 donkeys. But if you're wondering where all of the dogs and cats are hiding, the Humane Society of the United States isn't actually affiliated with the thousands of humane societies that operate shelters across the country. \"Local Humane Societies do take care of dogs, cats, pets, sometimes other animals, and they are amazing places, and we work really closely with them,\" said Block. \"But that's not us. We are a policy organization. We are a lobbyist shop. We work around the world, and we do rescue. But you can't get your dog or cat from us.\"",
      "For the past 70 years, the Humane Society of the United States, based in Washington, D.C., has worked on issues ranging from investigating the international fur trade, to advocating for disaster relief plans that take animals into account.",
      "This past week, the organization announced it's changing its name. To reduce confusion and better reflect its global focus, it will now be known as Humane World for Animals. \"Our mission still is about getting at the root causes to prevent tomorrow's cruelties, but also helping animals in crisis today,\" said Block. \"What the new name does is reflect what we do, how we do it, and where we do it.\"",
      "After nearly a decade of intense campaigning, the group recently celebrated a win in South Korea. Last year, that country's National Assembly voted to ban the dog meat industry.",
      "So, what is happening today that people in the future will look back and say, I can't believe we did that?",
      "Block said, \"I think the situation with the factory farming is one that we will all look back on and say, 'Really? Did we do that? Did we confine animals in these terrible, extreme situations just because it was cheaper or easier, or if we just throw them all together and seal the doors people won't know it's happening?'\"",
      "In 2023, Humane World for Animals successfully defended California's Proposition 12, an animal cruelty law, at the Supreme Court. The law established minimum space requirements for certain species of livestock.",
      "Block said, \"Confining animals in extremely terrible situations, where animals are stacked in cages on top of cages, it creates conditions where there are illnesses. So, there's swine flu, there's bird flu. You can't keep pretending that it has nothing to do with us.\"",
      "Protecting the six hundred or so residents of this ranch is, in a way, a symbolic act for an organization looking to improve the welfare of animals around the world \u2013 symbolic, like the name Black Beauty. As Kitty Block explains, the ability to consider an animal's perspective is part of what makes us human. \"It's important not just for the animals, but it's important for us, who we are, how we think about ourselves. How we want to have a world that we pass on to our children and our children's children. Animals belong there. And so, we are committed to making sure that they have that right, they have that ability, to thrive, because it matters to all of us.\"",

      "It has also forced a reckoning over what Americans want from their government. According to bestselling author Michael Lewis, \"I think, as we speak, our country is getting an education of what its government does, because it feels it has to. Who knew what USAID was three weeks ago?\"",
      "In an upcoming book, Lewis poses the question: \"Who Is Government?\" (to be published March 18 by Riverhead Books). \"Virtually every existential risk we face, we don't turn to the private sector to respond to it; we turn to the government,\" Lewis said. \"The federal government's mission is to keep us safe. And you don't really know that that insurance policy's not there until it isn't.\"",
      "The book is based on a Washington Post series Lewis edited last year, with little-known stories of federal workers. \"Just look at Christopher Mark's life work,\" he said. \"If we had just removed Christopher Mark from the history of the federal government, thousands of coal miners are dead. It's one person.\"",
      "Profiling military cemetery managers, and mission specialists for space exploration, Lewis and his co-authors make the case that claims of an impersonal so-called \"deep state\" are off-base; and that while there may be places for trims and updated systems, they argue the federal workforce is largely individuals dedicated to the public good. Lewis said, \"It's people who have been attracted to a problem. The government is there to solve lots of problems, usually problems that the market doesn't want to solve.\"",
      "I asked, \"Some people say government should run like a business. Are they right?\"",
      "\"No, they're wrong!\" Lewis replied. \"I don't see how you would run the government as a business, because the kind of problems the government is addressing, they're addressing it because you can't make money addressing it!\"",
      "The modern federal government took shape almost a century ago in response to the Great Depression. FDR's New Deal, followed by World War II, expanded government's reach into most every aspect of life.",
      "And since then, many conservatives have been pushing back. President Ronald Reagan infamously said, \"The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: 'I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.'\"",
      "In the 1980s, Reagan laid the foundation for what President Trump and Musk are doing today.",
      "I asked Lewis, \"There is an ethos in Silicon Valley: Move fast, break things, disrupt. You've covered leaders in that sector for decades. Does that approach work when it comes to the federal government, and the stakes are different?\"",
      "\"It doesn't work very well,\" he replied. \"If you take the kind of Elon Musk approach to the federal government \u2013 walking in (as he did at Twitter) and say, 'All you people are useless, we're going to get rid of half of you,' operating with kind of fear and chaos \u2013 I don't think any big institution is going to respond well to the, like, 'move fast and break things' approach.\"",
      "When asked for comment, a White House spokesman said the president is confident in Musk and his ability to \"shake things up,\" and said criticism of his method is \"fear-mongering.\"",
      "Costa asked mine safety engineer Christopher Mark, \"When you walk in this restaurant, people don't necessarily say, 'There's a federal worker.'\"",
      "\"No. That's right,\" he replied.",
      "\"They say, 'That's a coal miner. That's my friend. That's someone who works on mine safety.' But they're not thinking about you necessarily as part of the federal government \u2013 and that doesn't help the federal government.\"",
      "\"Another thing is that the federal government doesn't have money to advertise itself,\" said Mark. \"You know, people can say whatever they want about us, and we, you know, really can't respond.\"",
      "For Mark, there is little he can do to stave off the wave of changes from Washington. But he says he'll carry on, his head up, as long as he can.",
      "I asked, \"If you could bring Elon Musk down to the mines, what would you say to him?\"",
      "\"Well, I would say, 'You know, there's a lot of people that have to work in these mines and they deserve to be able to come home at the end of the shift to their family safely,'\" Mark replied. \"'And we're a part of making that happen. You can't take us out of the equation, and be sure that they're going to return home safely to their families.'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:15:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Despite falling divorce rates, some couples still face challenges when it comes to keeping a marriage intact. \"Sunday Morning\" talks with a couples therapist, a divorce lawyer, and the husband-and-wife team behind the podcast \"Marriage and Martinis.\"",
    "story": [
      "Danielle and Adam Silverstein met in high school in 1995 and agree their romance was picture-perfect. Marriage has been a different story. \"It's complicated!\" Danielle laughed. \"I always say, you know, 'Till death do us part is a really long time,' you know? It is a really long time.\"",
      "They've now been married a really long time \u2013 more than two decades \u2013 but a year ago, they nearly called it quits. \"We were really, really, like, disconnected,\" said Danielle. \"I mean, only speaking to each other when we had to.\"",
      "\"We had blowouts, you know, big arguments,\" said Adam.",
      "In a last-ditch effort to reconnect, they agreed on what they called a \"30-day challenge.\" For a month, each promised to change one thing that the other wanted. Things got better, then better still, and today, they say they are closer than ever.",
      "So, how did they manage to avoid becoming divorced? According to Adam, \"I think for us, why we're not \u2013 and I don't know about anybody else's relationships, so I can't speak for anybody but us \u2013 we just have this bond and connection and unique, I think, love that I don't think can be broken. We've tried many times! And it hasn't worked.\"",
      "They are not unique: Divorce rates in America have been dropping for a while \u2013 down 27 percent between 2012 and 2022, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Couples therapist Marissa Nelson gives her profession some of the credit.",
      "I asked, \"What is the main reason, if there is one, that couples turn up at your door?\"",
      "\"Well, I would be in Bora Bora on the beach, [if I had] a dollar every time somebody said we had communication issues,\" said Nelson.",
      "The real reason, she said, was, \"Longing. Loneliness. People are longing to be wanted.\"",
      "\"Why is this hard?\"",
      "\"It's hard because life sometimes is hard,\" Nelson said.",
      "So hard, in fact, that the Washington, D.C., therapist says saving the marriage isn't always the answer. \"As a couples therapist, you come out of school and you're really doe-eyed, and you want to save the world, no divorces. But as you continue to do this work, you understand that there are circumstances and reasons why people choose to uncouple. And for many people that I have had the honor of being able to work with, divorce was probably the best thing for their relationship and for their children.\"",
      "That's where New York divorce lawyer Robert Cohen comes in. Over three decades, he has handled as many as a thousand cases. But his clients often share one simple want: \"Generally they want to be happier,\" he said. \"What does that mean? It's very hard. It depends on the person, you know? How do you make somebody happier? It's not easy. But I think people just want to be happier.\"",
      "Including the rich and famous. Cohen has had a star-studded cast of clients, from Melinda Gates, Chris Rock and Tracy Morgan, to James Gandolfini and Christie Brinkley. Since divorce has built his career, it is shocking to learn how he really feels about it: \"I think the world would be better, I think our kids would be better, I think families would be better, if there wasn't divorce,\" he said.",
      "Cohen has even written an \"anti-divorce\" book, called, \"Reconcilable Differences: 7 Keys to Remaining Together from a Top Matrimonial Lawyer.\" His basic advice? \"Try to stay married, if you can,\" he said. \"I had a guy come in to see me, he was 95 years old. And I said, 'You're 95 years old. Why are you getting divorced?' He said, 'I can't live with my wife anymore, she smokes.' And it was driving him crazy. And I said to him, 'Can't you put in a ventilation system or some system in the apartment that will work?' And he just didn't want to do it anymore.\"",
      "He says he has referred between five and ten percent of his clients to marriage counselors. \"It's not gonna bring me to the poor house,\" he said. \"But it's gonna be a good thing for them. I'm not worried about that part of it.\"",
      "\"You're not worried about putting yourself out of business?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm not.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the now-happy Silversteins have gone from needing marital advice, to giving it in their wildly successful podcast, \"Marriage & Martinis.\" Asked to describe their podcast, Danielle said, \"Explicit!\"",
      "Recorded weekly in their New Jersey home, it's an uncensored, intimate look at their marriage, good and bad. They even fight on the air. \"Oh, yeah, at some points we've had to throw off the headphones and pause the podcast,\" Danielle said.",
      "\"Go our separate ways for an hour!\" Adam laughed.",
      "\"And we've also had to have discussions off the podcast sometimes, in the middle of an episode, and then go back,\" Danielle said.",
      "\"But the police have not been involved in this? We're not at that point?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not at that point, no. No police!\" Danielle laughed.",
      "But with eight million downloads, they may have tapped into some universal truths about marriage. \"I think the best feedback that we get is, 'Oh, my God, me too,' or, 'Oh, my God, us too,'\" said Adam.",
      "Danielle said, \"So many people are going through the same thing, but nobody talks about it.\"",
      "And talking is key. Just ask Marissa Nelson. \"Look, we don't get manuals for relationships; I wish we did! But we don't,\" she said. \"And I think that when you have two people that come together with different needs, you have to be vigilant and intentional that love and communication is an ongoing process that you're committing to.\"",
      "For divorce lawyer Robert Cohen, the biggest key to staying together, is, \"Not expecting perfect, but trying to be perfect.\"",

    "story": [
      "Probationary workers across multiple federal health agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services received virtually identical letters Saturday evening informing them they would be terminated from their positions, sources told CBS News.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs, and your performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the Agency,\" read the letter obtained by CBS News.",
      "The letter was signed by Jeffrey Anoka, acting head of human resources for the Department of Health and Human Services. One health official told CBS News thousands of letters were sent out Saturday.",
      "Probationary workers are those that generally have less than a year on the job and are easier to fire than other federal staff.",
      "The move comes amid a government-wide effort to cut probationary workers by the Department of Government Efficiency task force, or DOGE, led by billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "More than 5,000 probationary workers at health agencies had initially been slated to be let go, though not all received letters of termination Saturday. Some letters were also sent in error to people not intended to be let go, officials said.",
      "Some agencies have also been granted exemptions for a portion of their staff on the chopping block, as backlash has mounted over cuts at agencies like the Indian Health Service.",
      "Also not on the final list of cuts ordered by the Trump administration was the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, the agency's \"disease detectives,\" CBS News learned. Officials overseeing the fellowship had initially warned health departments and those in their ranks that they would be halved.",
      "Fellowship programs elsewhere in the agency were not as lucky. Officials said CDC's Public Health Associate Program, which places recent graduates in health departments throughout the country, was cut.",
      "Other agencies losing staff Saturday include the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which oversees the nation's pandemic stockpiles, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the National Institutes of Health.",
      "A White House official said Saturday that workers exempted from the cuts included scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA, workers for Medicare and frontline healthcare providers.",
      "\"This isn't a haphazard effort of us axing whoever we can 'get away' with axing for the sake of it. This is a calculated effort to streamline bureaucracy,\" said the official.",
      "Calley Means, an adviser for newly sworn-in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., defended the firings for reasons beyond cost savings, reiterating a criticism made during President Trump's presidential campaign that officials had not done enough to address drivers of sliding life expectancy in the U.S.",
      "\"It would be irrational not to make changes,\" Means wrote in a post to X.",
      "At the FDA, an employee said Saturday that scientists, engineers and an attorney had been among those terminated from the regulatory agency's ranks late Saturday.",
      "Cuts included parts of the FDA funded largely from fees that companies pay when they submit applications, not taxpayer dollars \u2014 like centers overseeing regulation of tobacco products and medical devices.",
      "The toll inflicted by this week's cuts stretches beyond probationary workers and fellows. Many contractors, who have fewer protections than agency staff, were suddenly told this week that they were being let go.",
      "One former CDC contractor said they had been one of two people on a small team in the Atlanta-based agency who knew how to operate a project to analyze electronic health records for disease surveillance.",
      "The only other person who knew how to use the project was a CDC employee still on probation.",
      "\"I fear they will be overrun with work and will end up dropping many projects. Projects were already beginning to drop while I was there,\" said the former CDC contractor.",
      "Many scientists that CBS News spoke to said they had uprooted their lives for the chance to serve the federal government, sometimes taking steep pay cuts from what they could be earning in academia or the private sector. Others had been on probation for staff roles after many years working for the same agency as a contractor.",
      "One former National Institutes of Health scientist said they had been reassured in a tearful meeting with their supervisors Friday that the decision had nothing to do with their performance, and had received praise for the progress they had made in the time since they had been hired.",

It all spilled onto the ice with Tkahuck asking Hagel to drop the gloves and the fourth-line Canada winger engaging in the fight two seconds in.",
      "Tkachuk's younger brother Brady did the same thing and tussled with Canada's Sam Bennet the next time the puck was dropped, three seconds in. J.T. Miller dropped gloves with Colton Parayko after a cross-check, and the two went at it to make the trio of bouts in the early going.",
      "The Americans followed the fisticuffs with a 3-1 victory over their biggest rivals.",
      "\"That was one of the best experiences of my life \u2014 just an unbelievable hockey game,\" said Dylan Larkin, who scored the go-ahead goal in the second period. \"The Tkachuk brothers and Millsy, what a start, and credit to those guys for answering the bell. And the crowd, just a great night for our sport and a great night for this rivalry.\"",
      "Playing at a blistering pace and with physicality throughout, the U.S. showed it could keep up with Canada's speed, skill, and talent in the NHL's first international tournament with its best players in nearly a decade.",
      "\"What an incredible hockey game,\" U.S. coach Mike Sullivan said.",
      "Apparently, the idea of the early-game fisticuffs came from a group chat involving the Tkachuk brothers and Miller. Matthew Tkachuk said it had nothing to do with the anthem booing. If anything, players felt it added to the fun of the night.",
      "\"It's just unbelievable, the atmosphere, to play on this stage in Canada, that was pretty cool for all of us I think,\" said winger Jake Guentzel, who scored twice, including the empty-netter that sealed it. \"There's a lot of excitement from our team coming out for warmups and just seeing how packed it was. That was pretty special.\"",
      "Canada coach Jon Cooper called the first minute purely \"mayhem.\"",
      "\"It was, I guess, 10 years of no international hockey exhaled in a minute and a half,\" Cooper said.",

      "On Saturday, Israel accepted the delivery of a consignment of MK-84 heavy bombs after Mr. Trump lifted a block placed on them by the Biden administration, Reuters reported. The MK-84 is an unguided 2,000-pound bomb, which can rip through thick concrete and metal, creating a wide blast radius.",
      "\"Peace through strength. You understand that, right? It's called peace through strength,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday when asked about the weapons delivery. \"You know, they contracted for those weapons a long time under the Biden administration, and then Biden wouldn't deliver the weapons.

After two days in the Austrian capital, gloom replaced their earlier hopes for a radically improved relationship.\u00a0 Suspicions deepened, as both leaders stumbled into dangerous miscalculations about Berlin and Cuba.\u00a0 Soon an ugly wall would be running through the divided German capital and, not too many months later, Khrushchev would foolishly decide to try to slip nuclear-tipped missiles and troops into Cuba.",
      "Kennedy had once appealed to Khrushchev as a genuine partner for peace. He saw in the young president an adversary with whom he thought he could do business. For a brief time, one month on the 1963 calendar, shortly after signing the historic atmospheric nuclear test ban agreement with the U.S., he allowed himself to live inside a beautiful bubble of hope. Every now and then, with closest advisers or family members, he would imagine six more years of other major U.S.-Soviet agreements that would, among other things, control the spread of nuclear weapons, settle the Berlin crisis and lead to a period of genuine peace.",
      "Why six years? he was asked.",

    "title": "Tennis world No. 1 Jannik Sinner gets 3-month ban to end doping case",
    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 21:33:12 -0500",
    "summary": "The timing means the 23-year-old Italian won't miss any Grand Slam tournaments. The French Open, the season's next major, starts May 25.",
    "story": [
      "Top-ranked tennis player\u00a0Jannik Sinner\u00a0accepted a three-month ban in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency and said Saturday the agreement ends a case that was \"hanging over me\" since his two positive doping tests nearly a year ago.",
      "WADA, which was seeking to ban the three-time Grand Slam champion from the sport for at least one year, had challenged a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency\u00a0not to suspend Sinner\u00a0for what the ITIA judged was accidental contamination by a banned anabolic steroid last March.",
      "Sinner's explanation \u2014 that trace amounts of Clostebol in his doping sample was due to a massage from a trainer who used the substance after cutting his own finger \u2014 had been accepted.",
      "The timing means the 23-year-old Italian won't miss any Grand Slam tournaments. The French Open, the season's next major, starts May 25.",
      "\"This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year,\" Sinner, who\u00a0won the Australian Open\u00a0in January, said in a statement. \"I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realize WADA's strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis I have accepted WADA's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a three-month sanction.\"",
      "The Montreal-based WADA had appealed the ITIA's ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland. It has formally withdrawn the appeal.",
      "\"WADA accepts the athlete's explanation for the cause of the violation as outlined in the first instance decision. WADA accepts that Mr. Sinner did not intend to cheat, and that his exposure to Clostebol did not provide any performance-enhancing benefit and took place without his knowledge as the result of negligence of members of his entourage,\" it said in Saturday's announcement.",
      "\"However,\"\u00a0the WADA statement\u00a0continued, \"under the code and by virtue of CAS precedent, an athlete bears responsibility for the entourage's negligence. Based on the unique set of facts of this case, a three-month suspension is deemed to be an appropriate outcome. As previously stated, WADA did not seek a disqualification of any results, save that which was previously imposed by the tribunal of first instance.\"",
      "WADA added that the International Tennis Federation and ITIA, \"both co-respondents to WADA's CAS appeal, neither of which appealed the first-instance decision, both accepted the case resolution agreement. \"",
      "The ATP Tour pointed to WADA's confirmation that Sinner \"had no intent to violate anti-doping rules and gained no competitive advantage.\"",
      "\"This case is an important reminder of players' responsibility to carefully manage the products and treatments they or their entourages use,\" the governing body added in a statement Saturday.",
      "On Friday, Sinner posted a\u00a0video on Instagram\u00a0of himself training in Doha at the Qatar Open, which starts next week. He was also scheduled to play in an exhibition in Las Vegas next month.",
      "The suspension is from Feb. 9 to May 4.",
      "Sinner could return at his home tournament, the Italian Open in Rome, which starts May 7.",
      "Italian Tennis and Padel Federation president Angelo Binaghi noted that while the case was \"a shameful injustice,\" the ban will mark \"the end of a nightmare\" for Sinner.",
      "Binaghi adds that the settlement \"demonstrates Jannik's innocence\" and that \"all of Italy\" will welcome him back at the Italian Open.",
      "The ITIA said it acknowledged the settlement but in its statement Saturday reiterated that \"we were satisfied that the player had established the source of the prohibited substance and that the breach was unintentional. Today's outcome supports this finding.\"",
      "Sinner's London-based lawyer, Jamie Singer commented: \"I am delighted that Jannik can finally put this harrowing experience behind him. WADA has confirmed the facts determined by the Independent Tribunal. It is clear that Jannik had no intent, no knowledge, and gained no competitive advantage. Regrettably, errors made by members of his team led to this situation.\"",
      "The handling of Sinner's case had raised questions about double standards. The positive tests weren't publicly revealed until August because Sinner successfully appealed against being provisionally banned from playing. He then won the U.S. Open in September. Novak Djokovic said he agreed there is \"a lack of consistency.\"",
      "In late November, five-time major champion\u00a0Iga Swiatek accepted a one-month suspension\u00a0after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine. Swiatek, the world No. 2, had failed a drug test in August, and the ITIA accepted her explanation that it was unintentional.",
      "In the singles rankings, Sinner currently leads No. 2 Alexander Zverev by 3,695 points.",
      "Sinner stands to lose 1,600 points due to the ban: 1,000 points from his Miami Open title last March; 400 points from reaching the Monte Carlo Masters semifinals last April; and 200 points from reaching the Madrid Open quarterfinals.",
      "If Zverev wins several titles while Sinner is out, the German could take over the No. 1 ranking.",

    "summary": "Hamas released dual U.S.-Israeli national Sagui Dekel-Chen along with two other hostages as the Gaza ceasefire remained on track after a tense week.",
    "story": [
      "American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, was among three hostages released by Hamas on Saturday morning after being held in captivity in Gaza for almost a year and a half. The other two hostages handed over to Red Cross personnel in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis were Israelis Sasha Troufanov, 29, and Iair Horn, 46.",
      "The men were led onto a stage by Hamas operatives in Khan Younis, all walking without apparent serious injuries, and they read statements but Israeli television did not broadcast the audio of the remarks.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces confirmed soon after that the Red Cross had transferred the men to the IDF, and that they had crossed the Gaza border into Israel.",
      "\"The returning hostages are currently on their way to an initial reception point in southern Israel, where they will be reunited with members of their families,\" the IDF said in a statement.\"",
      "The three men appeared pale and worn but seemed in better physical condition than the three hostages released last Saturday, who had emerged emaciated from 16 months of captivity.",
      "All three men were abducted during the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, from Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza, where they lived. Two were being held by Hamas and one was being held by another militant group in Gaza, Islamic Jihad.",
      "Dekel-Chen was working in the Nir Oz machine shop when Hamas carried out its Oct. 7 attack. He confronted the terrorists and was taken hostage, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of the people who were seized that day.",
      "His father Jonathan, who lives in New York, told CBS News in September 2024 that Dekel-Chen is the \"father of three little girls,\" the youngest of whom he still had not met.",
      "\"His seven-month-pregnant wife miraculously survived with their two little girls on October 7,\" Jonathan Dekel-Chen told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" at that time. On Saturday, the IDF released a photo of Sagui reunited with his wife, Avital.",
      "Troufanov, an engineer at Amazon, immigrated to Israel from the Soviet Union, the forum said. His father was killed during the Oct. 7 attack. His grandmother, mother, and girlfriend were taken hostage but then released as part of a previous hostage-prisoner exchange with Hamas in November 2023.",
      "Horn, 46, was born in Argentina and was kidnapped along with his brother, Eitan, on Oct. 7. Eitan remains in captivity and is not on the list of hostages expected to be released in the ceasefire's first stage.",
      "\"Now, we can breathe a little. Our Iair is home after surviving hell in Gaza,\" his family said in a statement. \"Now, we need to bring Eitan back so our family can truly breathe.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden said in a post on X Saturday that he and former first lady Jill Biden are \"relieved\" that Dekel-Chen is \"finally reunited with his family after 498 painful days.\"",
      "\"I am proud that the deal we negotiated has held, paving the way for the release of hostages,\" he said. \"My thoughts and prayers are with the remaining hostages and their families who have all been through hell. We hope all will be reunited in the weeks ahead.\"",
      "Hamas said Thursday that it would continue releasing hostages according to the terms of the ceasefire and hostage release deal with Israel after saying several days earlier that it would delay Saturday's scheduled exchange, accusing Israel of violations of the deal.",
      "Hamas, which has ruled over Gaza for almost two decades but has long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S., accused Israel on Monday of breaching the agreement by failing to secure emergency housing and other basic necessities for the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "Israel warned that if Saturday's exchange did not go ahead as planned, it would resume military operations in Gaza. Under the terms of the deal, Israel began releasing 369 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, including 36 serving life sentences over deadly attacks.",
      "A bus carrying the first released prisoners arrived in the occupied West Bank town of Beitunia and was greeted by a cheering crowd of relatives and supporters. Some appeared gaunt, and the Palestinian Red Crescent emergency service said four were immediately taken for medical treatment.",
      "Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of breaching the agreement multiple times, but it has remained in effect since its implementation began on January 19.",
      "The deal consists of three phases, and the current six-week first phase is to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages released in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners. As of Saturday, 24 of the Israeli hostages have been freed since the ceasefire began.",
      "Negotiations for the second phase of the deal have begun, which, if agreed, would see even more hostages released and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.",
      "Israel launched a 15-month war against Hamas in Gaza in response to the October 7 terrorist attack, which saw militants kill some 1,200 people in southern Israel and take 251 others hostage. The war killed more than 48,000 people in Gaza, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",
      "Independent analyses from outside organizations have\u00a0estimated the death toll\u00a0at closer to 64,000.",

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seeks greater military and economic support from the European Union.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for the creation of an \"armed forces of Europe\" to guard against Russia, appearing to suggest that the United States may no longer come to the continent's aid.",
      "Zelensky, speaking on the second day of the Munich Security Conference, said Ukraine's three-year fight against an invading Russian army has proved that a foundation exists for the creation of a European army that has long been discussed among some continental leaders.",
      "\"I really believe that time has come,\" he said. \"The armed forces of Europe must be created.\"",
      "It's unclear whether the idea will catch on with European leaders. Zelenskyy seeks greater military and economic support from the European Union and has repeatedly warned that other parts of Europe could be vulnerable to Russia's expansionist ambitions.",
      "Zelenskyy insisted that \"three years of full-scale war have proven that we already have the foundation for a united European military force. And now, as we fight this war and lay the groundwork for peace and security, we must build the armed forces of Europe.\"",
      "In his speech, Zelenskyy also alluded to the phone conversation between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, after which Mr. Trump said he and Putin would likely meet soon to negotiate a peace deal over Ukraine. It was a break with the Biden administration's harder line against Moscow over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "\"Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement, and the same rule should apply to all of Europe,\" Zelenskyy said. \"A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin. Not once did he mention that America needs Europe at the table. That says a lot.\"",
      "\"The old days are over when America supported Europe just because it always had.\"",
      "Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke by phone with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose office confirmed it was a follow-up to the conversation between Mr. Trump and Putin on Wednesday.",
      "Rubio reaffirmed Trump's \"commitment to finding an end to the conflict in Ukraine. In addition, they discussed the opportunity to potentially work together on a number of other bilateral issues,\" Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.",
      "Zelenskyy met with Vice President JD Vance on Friday to discuss the Trump administration's efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Vance said the U.S. seeks a \"durable\" peace, while Zelenskyy expressed the desire for extensive discussions to prepare for any end to the conflict.",
      "\"We want the killing to stop, but we want to achieve a durable, lasting peace,\" Vance said. \"Not the kind of peace that's going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple years down the road.\"",
      "In a speech at the conference on Friday, Vance warned that Europe needed to \"step up in a big way\" on defense, reiterating that Mr. Trump would like to see European allies in NATO contribute at least 5% of their gross domestic product to increased security spending.",
      "\"While the Trump administration is very concerned with European security, and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, we also believe that it's important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance lectured Europeans at the conference, telling them, \"The threat that I worry the most about vis-\u00e0-vis Europe is not Russia; it's not China.\"",
      "\"What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America,\" the vice president said.",
      "European leaders have been trying to understand Washington's\u00a0tough new approach to\u00a0issues such as democracy and Ukraine's future. The Trump administration continues to upend transatlantic conventions that have existed since after World War II.",
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz acknowledged the need for support for Ukraine but also recognized the economic realities, notably that Germany has budgetary rules that limit how much its government can spend.",
      "Scholz said it would be \"absolutely impossible to finance 2% and even more without changing the debt regulation that we have.\" However, he believes Germans are ready to increase spending and that there is \"broad support for all those saying we should do more.\" However, he explained that the rules will need to change for that.",
      "He said he was \"a bit disgusted\" that some people in Germany and elsewhere had suggested that raising such spending is \"something which we will be able to do,\" waving his hand dismissively to suggest it would be easy.",
      "\"It will not happen if we are not serious, if we are not honest with the people telling them that spending more for defense will mean that we have to increase also the debt we have,\" Scholz said. \"We have the strength, we have to power, and we have the economic capabilities to do what is necessary.\"",

Trump said he spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, reportedly doing so without consulting NATO members.",
      "In an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Waltz said that in back-to-back calls, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin separately agreed that \"only President Trump could get them to the table, only President Trump could drive peace.\"",

      "\"We had no less than our vice president, our secretary of state, our secretary of defense, our secretary of treasury, who was in Kyiv personally, and our special envoy {Keith} Kellogg all in Europe this week, all engaging our allies,\" Waltz said. \"Now, they may not like some of the sequencing that is going on in these negotiations, but I have to push back on any notion that they aren't being consulted. They absolutely are.\"",
      "\"At the end of the day though, this is going to be under President Trump's leadership that we get this war to an end,\" he added.",
      "Among the critics of the Trump administration's handling of the negotiations was Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who said the president's inability to \"even identify Ukraine as an equal bargaining power, after the blood Ukraine has shed, [is] just a shocking surrender of American values and interests.\" Noting how Zelenskyy said he would not be bound by any deal negotiated between Russia and the U.S., \"Fox News Sunday\" host Shannon Bream asked Waltz if Kyiv would have a seat at the table.",

And I'll point out that much of the European aid is actually in the form of a loan. That is repaid. It's repaid with interest on Russian assets. So President Trump is rethinking the entire dynamic here. That has some people uncomfortable, but I think Zelenskyy would be very wise to enter into this agreement with the United States. There's no better way to secure them going forward, and further, there was a question of whether Putin would come to the table. He has now done so under President Trump's leadership, and we're going to continue those talks in the coming weeks at President Trump's direction.\"",

The United States and Europe have supported this effort, but the United States unquestionably has borne the brunt of that support over the years, but now President Trump is clear it needs to come to an end.\"",
      "Waltz added that the negotiations will be driven by \"key tenants,\" including ensuring that there's a \"permanent end to the war\" and that the conflict \"can't be ended on the battlefield.\"",
      "\"This has turned into a World War I-style meat grinder of human beings,\" he said, adding that economic integration going forward would be the \"best arbiter of peace\" and long-term military security guarantees have to be European-led.",

As highlighted by\u00a0Malwarebytes, a new wave of information stealers is taking over, and they are far more dangerous, going after passwords, authentication cookies, credit card details and even cryptocurrency.",
      "This shift started in mid-2023 with the arrival of\u00a0Atomic Stealer, also known as AMOS, a piece of malware that looked much more like something you would see on Windows than the typical Mac threats. AMOS was not just effective. It was easy to use and sold as a service \u00a0for $1,000 a month with a slick web-based control panel. That success led to the rise of even more dangerous variants.",

Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",

Enable automatic updates for macOS, Android and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates.

      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here. It generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself.

Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",

      "Cyberscams have reached alarming levels in the U.S., with nearly 30% of Americans falling victim to fraudulent schemes in the past year alone.",
      "The financial toll is staggering \u2014 scams cost Americans over $159 billion annually, with average individual losses now exceeding $3,500 per victim. This epidemic is not just a financial crisis but also a human rights issue, as many scams originate from forced labor operations in Southeast Asia.",
      "With nearly 90% of Americans targeted by scam attempts and 40% receiving suspicious messages daily, the question remains: how can we protect ourselves and hold perpetrators accountable in an increasingly digital world?",

      "The word scam with data in the background\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The mechanics of \"pig butchering\"",
      "One of the most pervasive scams today is the so-called \"pig butchering\" scheme. Originating in China and spreading across Southeast Asia, this scam involves criminals building trust with victims through social media or messaging apps. Once trust is established, victims are lured into fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes. These scams are meticulously crafted to appear legitimate, often involving fake trading platforms and simulated profits. Victims are encouraged to invest more until they are \"slaughtered,\" losing their\u00a0entire savings when the scammers vanish with their funds.",
      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "Forced labor behind these scam centers",
      "What makes these scams even more horrifying is their reliance on human trafficking. Criminal syndicates in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos force trafficked individuals to run these operations under threat of violence. These \"scam centers\" operate in lawless regions controlled by rebel groups or corrupt officials, making international intervention challenging. Survivors describe conditions akin to modern slavery, with physical abuse and even torture being common.",

      "BEST PRESIDENT\u2019S DAY DEALS",
      "Why America is a prime target",
      "Cyberscams have taken hold in the U.S. for several reasons that make it particularly vulnerable. As an American, you\u2019re likely connected to the digital world through social media platforms, messaging apps and other online tools. This high level of connectivity makes it easier for scammers to reach you directly, whether through a text message, email or social media chat. The sheer number of people online in the U.S. creates a vast pool of potential targets for cybercriminals.",
      "Additionally, the growing popularity of cryptocurrency in the U.S. has made it a\u00a0prime medium for fraud. Cryptocurrency transactions are fast, anonymous and difficult to trace, which makes them ideal for scammers looking to steal funds without leaving a trail. Many scams are designed to exploit this lack of transparency, leaving victims with little chance of recovering their money once it\u2019s gone.",
      "Another major issue is the lack of a centralized reporting system for cyberscams in the U.S. If you\u2019ve ever been scammed or know someone who has, you might have noticed how confusing it can be to figure out where to report the crime \u2014 whether to the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or another agency. This fragmented system not only makes it harder for victims to seek help but also prevents authorities from gathering comprehensive data to tackle the problem effectively. These factors combined have made Americans some of the most targeted individuals in the world when it comes to cyberscams.",

      "Several countries have implemented innovative measures to combat cyberscams, offering valuable lessons for the U.S. Singapore, for instance, has introduced a mandatory SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) that requires organizations to register their alphanumeric Sender IDs. This system effectively blocks unregistered SMS senders, significantly reducing impersonation scams. In fact, cases involving scam SMSes in Singapore fell by 70% over three months after mandating the SSIR.",
      "Britain has taken a different approach by establishing a dedicated \"159\" hotline, allowing residents to instantly verify suspicious calls. This simple yet effective system provides a quick way for individuals to check the legitimacy of unexpected communications, potentially preventing many scams before they occur.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Many nations have also implemented stricter authentication measures, such as biometric checks and in-app verifications, which have proven highly effective in reducing fraud. For example, Singapore has required facial verification for higher-risk transactions through Singpass since 2022, resulting in no further reports of malware-enabled scams involving unauthorized CPF withdrawals since its implementation in June 2023.",
      "Some countries are exploring ways to slow down cryptocurrency transactions or cap transfer amounts, which could significantly hinder scammers who rely on quick, anonymous transfers. These measures, combined with a coordinated global response involving major victim nations like the U.S. and China, could prove instrumental in dismantling criminal networks more effectively. By learning from these international examples and adapting them to the American context, the U.S. could significantly strengthen its defenses against the rising tide of cyberscams.",

      "1. Verify before you act: Always verify the identity of the person or organization contacting you. Use official contact information to reach out directly and confirm the legitimacy of the request.",
      "2. Limit personal information sharing: Avoid sharing personal or financial information over the phone, email or online unless you are certain of the recipient's identity and legitimacy.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts:\u00a0A robust password should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple platforms, and consider using a reputable\u00a0password manager to store and generate complex passwords securely.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a code sent to your phone or biometric authentication. This ensures that even if your password is compromised, unauthorized access remains highly unlikely.",
      "5. Keep your devices and software up to date:\u00a0By regularly installing the\u00a0latest updates and security patches, you can ensure your devices are equipped with the latest security features and bug fixes, reducing the risk of becoming a target for cyberattacks. Many cyberattacks exploit unpatched vulnerabilities, so enabling automatic updates for your operating system, apps and antivirus software can significantly reduce your risk.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using a service that specializes in removing your personal information from the internet to reduce your exposure to potential scammers. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "7. Monitor financial accounts: Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for any unusual or unauthorized transactions. Promptly report any suspicious activity.",
      "8. Be skeptical of unsolicited requests: Treat unexpected requests for money or personal information with caution. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into acting quickly.",
      "9. Be vigilant against phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails or messages. Ensure your devices are protected with strong antivirus software that can detect and block malicious activities. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 10:00:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Security experts have discovered that hackers are targeting apps on the App Store to spread malware that steals information from saved screenshots.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson walks you through the process.",
      "Every tech expert will tell you the App Store is safer than Google Play Store. Some might even claim it is impossible to download a malicious app from the App Store, but they are wrong.",
      "While I admit the App Store is a secure and tightly controlled ecosystem, it cannot completely shield you. Security researchers have found that hackers are targeting several apps on the App Store to spread malware that steals information from screenshots saved on a device.",
      "The issue also affects those downloading apps from the Google Play Store.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW",
      "A person holding an iPhone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "How the malware works and what makes it different",
      "According to\u00a0researchers at Kaspersky, this malware campaign is more advanced than typical info stealers, both in how it works and how it spreads. Instead of relying on social engineering tricks to get users to grant permissions like most banking trojans or spyware, this malware hides inside seemingly legitimate apps and slips past Apple and Google\u2019s security checks.",
      "One of its standout features is Optical Character Recognition. Instead of stealing stored files, it scans screenshots saved on the device, extracts text and sends the information to remote servers.",
      "Once installed, the malware operates stealthily, often activating only after a period of dormancy to avoid raising suspicion. It employs encrypted communication channels to send stolen data back to its operators, making it difficult to trace. Plus, it spreads through deceptive updates or hidden code within app dependencies, an approach that helps it evade initial security screenings by app store review teams.",
      "The infection vectors vary between Apple and Google\u2019s ecosystems. On iOS, the malware is often embedded within apps that initially pass Apple\u2019s rigorous review process but later introduce harmful functionality through updates. On Android, the malware can exploit sideloading options, but even official Google Play apps have been found to carry these malicious payloads, sometimes hidden within SDKs (software development kits) supplied by third-party developers.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "What's being stolen, and who's responsible?",
      "The scope of stolen information is alarming. This malware primarily targets crypto wallet recovery phrases but is also capable of exfiltrating login credentials, payment details, personal messages, location data and even biometric identifiers. Some versions are designed to harvest authentication tokens, allowing attackers to access accounts even if users change their passwords.",
      "The apps serving as malware carriers include ComeCome, ChatAi, WeTink, AnyGPT and more. These range from productivity tools to entertainment and utility apps. In some cases, malicious developers create these apps with full knowledge of the malware\u2019s purpose. In others, the issue appears to be a supply chain vulnerability, where legitimate developers unknowingly integrate compromised SDKs or third-party services that introduce malicious code into their applications.",
      "We reached out to Apple for a comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims. (Kaspersky)",
      "Apple's response to screenshot-scanning malware discovered in App Store",
      "Apple has removed the 11 iOS apps mentioned in Kaspersky's report from the App Store. Furthermore, they discovered that these 11 apps shared code signatures with 89 other iOS apps, all of which had been previously rejected or removed for violating Apple's policies, resulting in the termination of their developer accounts.",
      "Apps requesting access to user data such as Photos, Camera or Location must provide relevant functionality or face rejection. They must also clearly explain their data usage when prompting users for permission. iOS privacy features ensure users always control whether their location information is shared with an app. Also, starting in iOS 14, the PhotoKit API \u2014 which allows apps to request access to a user\u2019s Photos library \u2014 added additional controls to let users select only specific photos or videos to share with an app instead of providing access to their entire library.",
      "The App Store Review Guidelines mandate that developers are responsible for ensuring their entire app, including ad networks, analytics services and third-party SDKs, complies with the guidelines. Developers must carefully review and choose these components. Apps must also accurately represent their privacy practices, including those of the SDKs they use, in their privacy labels.",
      "In 2023, the App Store rejected over 1.7 million app submissions for failing to meet its stringent privacy, security and content standards. It also rejected 248,000 app submissions found to be spam, copycats or misleading and prevented 84,000 potentially fraudulent apps from reaching users.",

      "5 ways users can protect themselves from such malware",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Installing strong antivirus software can add an extra layer of protection by scanning apps for malware, blocking suspicious activity and alerting you to potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Stick to trusted developers and well-known apps:\u00a0Even though malware has been found in official app stores, users can still minimize their risk by downloading apps from reputable developers with a long track record. Before installing an app, check its developer history, read multiple reviews and look at the permissions it requests. If an app from an unknown developer suddenly gains popularity but lacks a strong review history, approach it with caution.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully:\u00a0Many malicious apps disguise themselves as legitimate tools but request excessive permissions that go beyond their stated purpose. For example, a simple calculator app should not need access to your contacts, messages or location. If an app asks for permissions that seem unnecessary, consider it a red flag and either deny those permissions or avoid installing the app altogether. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android.",
      "4. Keep your device and apps updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to distribute malware. Always\u00a0keep your operating system and apps updated to the latest versions, as these updates often contain critical security patches. Enabling automatic updates ensures that you stay protected without having to manually check for new versions.",
      "5. Be wary of apps that promise too much:\u00a0Many malware-infected apps lure users by offering features that seem too good to be true \u2014 such as free premium services, extreme battery optimizations or AI-powered functionality that appears unrealistic. If an app\u2019s claims sound exaggerated or its download numbers skyrocket overnight with questionable reviews, it\u2019s best to avoid it. Stick to apps with a transparent development team and verifiable functionalities.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The new malware campaign highlights the need for stricter vetting processes, continuous monitoring of app behavior post-approval and greater transparency from app stores regarding security risks. While Apple and Google have removed the malicious apps upon detection, the fact that they made it onto the platform in the first place exposes a gap in the existing security framework. As cybercriminals refine their methods, app stores must evolve just as quickly or risk losing the trust of the very users they claim to protect.",

      "3. Research and verify: Conduct an online search using the person's name, email address or phone number to see if any suspicious or fraudulent activities are associated with them.\u00a0Reverse image search their profile pictures to check if they are stolen from elsewhere on the internet.

      "From the outset, the endeavor touted DEI as a key part of enshrining Obama's legacy at the 19.3-acre site, where costs have ballooned from an initial $350 million to $830 million in 2021 based on its previous annual reports, with no publicly available figures available for updated projected costs. The project set out \"ambitious goals\" for certain construction diversity quotas, with its contracts to be allocated to\u00a0\"diverse suppliers,\" 35% of which were required to be minority-based enterprises (MBEs).",
      "\"With these aggressive goals, the foundation is hoping to set a new precedent for diversity and inclusion in major construction projects in Chicago and beyond,\" the Obama Foundation wrote in a 2017 press release.",
      "Former President Obama and his presidential center. (Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg, left, and Eileen T. Meslar/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images, right.)",
      "The importance of DEI was cited on several occasions in an explosive lawsuit filed last month by Robert McGee, the Black co-owner of II in One Construction. The firm is a minority-owned business subcontractor that provided concrete and rebar services for the center.",
      "It is not clear what role DEI quotas played in the hiring of II In One as a subcontractor. II In One was one of three firms that made up a joint venture called Concrete Collective. The other firms included another minority firm called Trice Construction Company along with W.E. O\u2019Neil. Together they formed a 51% minority-led joint-venture team.",
      "McGee alleged that he and his firm were racially discriminated against by Thornton Tomasetti, a New York-based company that oversees structural engineering and design services.",
      "In the lawsuit, McGee claims that Thornton Tomasetti changed standards and imposed new rules around rebar spacing and tolerance requirements that differed from the American Concrete Institute standards. The suit claims these changes resulted in his firm running up massive overruns in excess of $40 million, which put it on the verge of bankruptcy.",
      "McGee's lawsuit stems from a memorandum Thornton Tomasetti wrote to the project\u2019s leading construction partners about a year ago claiming that II in One \u2014 and the contracting firm it teamed up with on the project \u2014 were responsible for numerous challenges during the project.",
      "The memorandum contained images of cracked slabs and exposed rebar to support its claims. Thornton Tomasetti said it spent hundreds of hours reviewing, analyzing, re-designing, and responding to corrective work and that subcontractors caused \"a multitude of problems in the field.\"",
      "\"The construction issues were all unequivocally driven by the underperformance and inexperience of the concrete subcontractor,\" the memorandum states.",
      "Thornton Tomasetti said the challenges with the concrete were due solely to the subcontractors and wrote that it \"cannot stand by while contractors attempt to blame their own shortcomings on the design team.\"",

      "The Obama Presidential Center pictured this week. (Fox News)",
      "That memorandum served as the basis of McGee\u2019s lawsuit last month, as he alleges it contained \"baseless criticisms and defamatory and discriminatory accusations.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Thornton Tomasetti undermined the project\u2019s diversity and inclusion goals, which were outlined in the project's general contract. The lawsuit also cites a DEI report by the project's construction manager in 2022, which outlines the project as \"achieving significant diverse business participation.\" A report breaking down the demographics of those involved in the project was also released in April.",
      "The suit claims the plaintiffs were \"subjected to unjustified and discriminatory conduct\u2026 which directly undermined the Obama Foundation\u2019s DEI goals and commitments, and mission to bring transformative change to the construction industry and local community by providing solutions to barriers that have historically prevented disadvantaged businesses from participating on projects of this magnitude.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Thornton Tomasetti violated the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and that its alleged \"defamatory and discriminatory statements and actions,\" caused II in One, Bob McGee and the other subcontractors to suffer extreme financial losses and potential bankruptcy.",
      "The suit alleges that Thornton Tomasetti discriminated against II In One \"on the basis of race.\"",
      "McGee claims Thornton Tomasetti falsely accused II in One of lacking sufficient qualifications and experience to perform its work, while stating in the memo that non-minority-owned contractors were sufficiently qualified.",
      "The lawsuit also claims the Obama Foundation relied on Thornton Tomasetti\u2019s memo for not paying the subcontracting firms around $40.75 million for \"additional costs incurred\" at the site near Jackson Park in\u00a0Chicago.",
      "McGee's lawsuit refutes the allegations in Thornton Tomasetti's memo that his firm was inexperienced or questionably qualified, pointing to II in One\u2019s 40-year track record in the industry and its completion of major Chicagoland projects, including Millennium Park, Harold Washington Cultural Center, and the American Airlines terminal at O\u2019Hare Airport.",
      "In a memo, Thornton Tomasetti shared images of cracked slab and exposed rebar. (Lawsuit)",
      "\"Moreover, Bob McGee was aware and supportive of the Obama Foundation\u2019s diversity and inclusion goals for the project and never imagined that the Obama Foundation\u2019s structural engineer would single out a minority-owned subcontractor for unfair criticism and falsely accuse II in One of lacking sufficient qualifications and experience to perform its work, while, in the same letter, stating that the non-minority-owned contractors were sufficiently qualified,\" the memo reads.",
      "\"In a shocking and disheartening turn of events, the African American owner of a local construction company finds himself and his company on the brink of forced closure because of racial discrimination by the structural engineer,\" the lawsuit reads. \"II in One and its joint venture partners \u2026 was subjected to baseless criticisms and defamatory and discriminatory accusations by the Obama Foundation\u2019s structural engineer, Thornton Tomasetti.\"",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court has said that for an inmate to challenge an execution method under the Eighth Amendment, they must prove that it creates \"a substantial risk of serious harm\" and that there are \"known and available alternatives\" that are \"feasible, readily implemented\" and that will significantly reduce the risk of severe pain, which is why Nance's lawyers suggested the firing squad.",
      "Boulee ruled in March 2020 that Nance's arguments were procedurally barred because he had waited too long to bring them and that he had failed to prove how his constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment would be violated.",
      "Nance appealed and a panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that since lethal injection is the only method of execution authorized by Georgia law, he was effectively challenging the validity of his death sentence, which the panel said he was procedurally barred from doing.",

Justice Elena Kagan wrote in the majority opinion that he was \"not confined to proposing a method authorized by the executing State's law\" when he challenged Georgia's execution method. She said there is no reason to believe that changing state law to allow executions by firing squad would be a \"substantial impediment\" to carrying out the execution.",

      "International concern over the stability of the ceasefire reached new heights after Hamas threatened not to release any more hostages \u2013 in direct violation of the agreement \u2013 after it claimed that Israel had violated the treaty by not facilitating the transport of humanitarian aid and targeting Palestinians in airstrikes.",
      "Trump then said on Monday that Israel should cancel the ceasefire agreement if Hamas did not hand over all remaining hostages, not just the three slated to be released on Feb. 15 under the ceasefire agreement.",

      "UNITED NATIONS \u2013 President Donald Trump has made major foreign policy moves in his first few weeks in office, including cutting off U.S. funding to the controversial United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). UNRWA has long faced accusations of ties to terrorists, which have intensified over the course of the Israel-Hamas war that began with the massacre on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Former President Joe Biden initially cut off U.S. funding to UNRWA in January 2024, months into the war, after Israel accused members of the U.N. agency of taking part in Hamas\u2019 brutal attacks.",
      "U.N. Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer said Americans need to know that some U.N. agencies, such as UNRWA, are founded on \"altruistic good intentions,\" but have \"morphed into something which is the complete opposite of what it was supposed to be.\"",

      "UNRWA was founded in 1949 \"to carry out direct relief and works programs for Palestine refugees,\" according to the agency\u2019s website. However, Neuer disputes Palestinians\u2019 refugee status and says that President Trump\u2019s proposed Gaza takeover uncovered a \"truth that has been hidden.\"",
      "Neuer points out that UNRWA supporters and critics of the president\u2019s proposal have accused Trump of \"uprooting them [Palestinians] from their homes and lands,\" which would mean that \"they\u2019re not refugees.\" Gaza, which the U.N. recognizes as part of the \"State of Palestine,\" would be considered their home under this criticism, negating their refugee status.",
      "However, the problems with UNRWA go beyond ambiguous definitions. Neuer told Fox News Digital that the agency \"systematically employed individuals who were supporting terrorism.\" He pointed to Fathi al-Sharif, who served as the principal of a school run by UNRWA, as well as the agency\u2019s teachers\u2019 union in Lebanon.",
      "\"We know that the head of UNRWA's education system, namely, teacher, school principal and head of the teachers\u2019 union of 2,000 teachers in Lebanon, was a man named Fathi al-Sharif\u2026 he was the head of Hamas in Lebanon,\" Neuer said, adding that American taxpayers\u2019 money funded al-Sharif and \"the entire education system that he oversaw.\"",
      "In the case of Suhail al-Hindi, UNRWA\u2019s former head of a \"local staff union in Gaza,\" the agency insists that it suspended and fired al-Hindi after an announcement that he had been \"elected to political office with Hamas.\"",
      "In response to a request for comment, UNRWA told Fox News Digital that it \"prohibits any type of involvement of staff in a militant or armed group.

      "UNRWA referenced al-Hindi's case specifically, noting it \"also dismissed another staff member whose name appeared in the list of those newly elected to Hamas political office in Gaza.\"",
      "Contrary to critics\u2019 claims, Neuer told Fox News Digital that Israel was not always trying to shut down UNRWA, saying that the Jewish State first saw the agency as \"convenient\" in the late 1960s. However, Neuer said that Israel\u2019s view on the agency has greatly shifted, particularly since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attacks.",

      "While Israel\u2019s views on the agency have changed, prompting action from the country\u2019s government, Neuer points out that several countries, including the U.S., failed to \"take any meaningful action\" against UNRWA.

      "A protester holds a flag outside the United Nations Relief and Works Agency during the demonstration. (Ahmed Zakot/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)",

      "While Musk has received widespread attention for the upheaval he is causing in the U.S. government, as well as for his growing role in Germany, where he recently told voters to \u201cmove beyond\u201d Nazi guilt, the tech tycoon is making his influence felt in a long and growing list of other countries.",
      "Musk has posted online in support of right-wing street demonstrations in Brazil and Ireland. He has welcomed a new conservative prime minister in New Zealand and expressed agreement with a nationalist right-wing politician in the Netherlands. He\u2019s met in person several times with the right-wing leaders of Argentina and Italy. His social media app X has complied with censorship requests from right-wing leaders in India and Turkey.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 20:29:51 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan denied allegations of a quid pro quo between the administration and New York Mayor Eric Adams, calling the notion that the Justice Department moved to dismiss criminal charges against Adams in exchange for the mayor's cooperation on Trump\u2019s immigration plan \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "White House border czar Tom Homan on Sunday denied allegations of a quid pro quo between the Trump administration and New York Mayor Eric Adams, calling the notion that the Justice Department moved to dismiss criminal charges against Adams in exchange for the mayor\u2019s cooperation on immigration \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "CNN anchor Dana Bash asked Homan, \u201cIt sounds like the DOJ dropped the case against Adams and, in exchange, he let you into Rikers,\u201d referring to the New York City jail. \u201cIs that what happened?\u201d",
      "\u201cNo, I think that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Homan replied, saying the two have been discussing access to the Rikers Island jail for months.",
      "During a closed-door meeting with Homan on Thursday, Adams agreed to allow U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to operate at Rikers.",
      "The two men then sat for an interview with \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Friday, during which Homan said, \u201cI came to New York City and I wasn\u2019t going to leave with nothing,\u201d adding he would be on Adams\u2019 case and \u201cbe in his office, up his butt,\u201d if the mayor did not follow through with his commitment.",
      "Homan, who served as acting ICE director in President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration, said Sunday that the conversation between him and Adams \u2014 a former New York City police captain \u2014 was \u201ccop to cop.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just think people are making a lot about nothing,\u201d Homan said. \u201cI mean, again, I went up there as the ICE director, now the border czar, and we collaborated on how to move illegal alien crime, decrease it down in New York City, and find the worst of the worst. And that\u2019s what we talked about. It was cop to cop, not border czar to mayor, cop to cop.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department moved to dismiss corruption charges against Adams on Friday, following an internal mutiny that included a wave of resignations over the department\u2019s handling of Adams\u2019 case.",
      "At least seven DOJ officials have resigned as part of the fallout of Adams\u2019 legal saga, including Danielle R. Sassoon, who was the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered U.S. prosecutors in New York to dismiss the charges against Adams, arguing in part that the case was interfering with Adams\u2019 ability to help the administration tackle illegal immigration.",
      "Sassoon, a conservative who clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, resigned in a sharply worded memo to Attorney General Pam Bondi, which said that during a Jan. 31 meeting with Bove and Adams\u2019 lawyers, \u201cAdams\u2019s attorneys repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with Department\u2019s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed.\u201d",
      "Adams, who was elected mayor in 2021 and is up for re-election in November, was indicted last year on bribery and fraud charges and had been facing trial in April.",
      "Adams has pleaded not guilty and has insisted he is innocent and the charges are politically motivated. Adams and his lawyer, Alex Spiro, vehemently denied any quid pro quo offered in the Jan. 31 meeting."

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Uncertainty is running high on Main Street after a deluge of economic policy changes, with some entrepreneurs reporting unpaid invoices and other funding worries.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s first weeks in office have brought a flurry of changes from funding freezes and tariffs to a crackdown on diversity efforts. While courts have halted some of them, small businesses faced with higher costs, steep interest rates and more cautious consumers share a similar message: This isn\u2019t helping.",
      "David Funk said he was stunned when the U.S. Department of Agriculture rejected his $65,000 invoice for work his company had completed since October.",
      "The founder of Zero Emissions Northwest, a Spokane, Washington-based consultancy, Funk connects farmers with federal grants to subsidize equipment purchases and energy bills. A week after his invoice denial, agency representatives confirmed it was because of Trump\u2019s \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d order, which halted many projects funded through the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\u201cWhat it\u2019s resulting in is jobs lost, projects canceled and more jobs lost,\u201d said Funk, who furloughed all three of his employees about two weeks ago. Many of his clients are now stuck with equipment they can\u2019t finance on their own. \u201cIt is shocking to some of them who have voted for Trump to realize that this might directly impact them,\u201d he added.",
      "Weeks after the Office of Management and Budget rescinded the sweeping freeze on grants and loans it had issued days earlier, Shaundell Newsome, founder of Sumnu Marketing in Las Vegas, said his agency\u2019s internships could still be on the chopping block. The program, with space for four interns per year, is sustained by a Labor Department grant.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of confusion about what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not real,\u201d he said of the federal directives. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have those dollars to offset the training now, we\u2019ve got to make a business decision.\u201d",
      "Newsome still plans to make his next hire in March, after the agency that disburses the funds said they remained on track to reach him on schedule. But he\u2019s concerned about funding for the rest of the year, including a summer program for high schoolers.",
      "Funk shared that sense of urgency. \u201cNot getting paid due to a canceled contract and not getting paid due to a paused contract has the same result: We\u2019re not getting paid,\u201d he said.",
      "While small businesses remain broadly optimistic about the months ahead, the National Federation of Independent Business\u2019 latest survey also found that members\u2019 uncertainty hit its third-highest level on record. Many reported curtailing plans to invest in their businesses, wary of tapping cash reserves should economic conditions deteriorate.",
      "Not getting paid due to a canceled contract and not getting paid due to a paused contract has the same result: We\u2019re not getting paid.",
      "David Funk, founder of Zero Emissions Northwest",
      "Meanwhile, the leaders of major tech firms have been personally courting the president\u2019s favor, and there are signs of executives warming up to an administration promising deeper tax cuts and deregulation. But the nation\u2019s 33 million small businesses, which employ nearly half the U.S. workforce and account for over 43% of economic output, typically have less lobbying clout or margin to adapt to federal policy swings, advocates say.",
      "\u201cWe want to see more parity,\u201d said Richard Trent, executive director of Main Street Alliance, a coalition of more than 30,000 small businesses. Trent criticized the \u201coligarchic acolytes\u201d who he said appeared to be in Trump\u2019s \u201cinner circle\u201d and called for a more \u201cnuanced conversation where everyone\u2019s included.\u201d",
      "A White House spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump\u2019s business-friendly reputation was one of the leading factors that helped return him to the White House. While the U.S. averaged 443,302 monthly business applications during the first three years of the Biden administration as the economy recovered from Covid-19, compared with 282,362 in the equivalent period of Trump\u2019s first term, many entrepreneurs recall the current president\u2019s earlier time in office favorably. The NFIB\u2019s optimism index soared at the time, buoyed in part by Trump\u2019s tax cuts, and interest rates and inflation both remained historically low until the pandemic hit.",
      "Still, some small-business owners are now taking steps to insulate themselves from the potential negative impacts of recent White House efforts \u2014 including those that remain in limbo \u2014 before waiting to see how it all shakes out.",
      "Shortly after the election, Beatrice Barba told NBC News she was looking to purchase $200,000 worth of her regular inventory ahead of Trump\u2019s promised tariff. The sippy cups she sells at Tabor Place, her San Francisco Bay Area e-commerce line of children\u2019s goods, rely on a durable borosilicate glass from a Chinese manufacturer.",
      "But in recent weeks, Barba has opted to gamble on less cash-intensive measures. She\u2019s reduced the order to $100,000 to avoid having the products sit idle for too long, and while some of her other items need to be restocked \u2014 at an expected $50,000 cost \u2014 she\u2019s holding off for now. Barba said she suspects Trump\u2019s 10% additional tariffs on China could change or go away in trade negotiations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s an extra 5,000 bucks. I don\u2019t want to have to spend that,\u201d she said. \u201cTen percent is a lot. There is no company, retail or otherwise, that would not be forced to pass that margin on to their customers.\u201d",
      "Barba said there are ways the administration could help small businesses directly, such as by offering loans to build more U.S. factories so companies like hers could rely less on components made overseas. She\u2019d also like to see tariff exemptions for employers of fewer than 50 people.",
      "The full effects of Trump\u2019s economic policies remain to be seen. In a note to clients this month, JPMorgan analysts posed the question, \u201cIs this a business friendly administration?\u201d",
      "They highlighted the potential economic drag created by abrupt, sweeping changes to U.S. policy, including mass deportations that the White House is looking to ramp up. The impact of moves like these could be magnified \u201cthrough a tightening in labor markets that constrains Fed easing,\u201d they said, flagging the risk that more uncertainty could delay interest rate cuts.",
      "The longer steep borrowing costs persist, the more Main Street entrepreneurs could suffer a disproportionate squeeze, said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.",
      "\u201cSmall businesses tend to be more leveraged than larger businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tend to borrow more at the short end of the yield curve, rather than the long end, and they tend to have significantly less cash holdings.\u201d",
      "Corrine Hendrickson, owner of a day care center in New Glarus, Wisconsin, said she has \u201can extra layer of concern because I don\u2019t have access to capital.\u201d She began scrambling upon learning of last month\u2019s funding freeze, unsure if she could sustain her business without the Child Care and Development Block Grant that subsidizes care for a number of her clients.",
      "\u201c[One parent] saw the news and was concerned she wouldn\u2019t get the funding, and wasn\u2019t sure how they would pay me the next month, and what that would mean. Would I expel him?\u201d she said.",
      "Hendrickson said the subsidies resumed on Feb. 1, soon after the White House lifted its funding freeze following a court ruling that halted it. But she\u2019s nervously watching as Republicans pursue deep spending cuts to accommodate Trump\u2019s agenda, with one proposal calling for potential cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that helps fund the healthy meals Hendricks provides.",
      "She\u2019s also worried that the child care grant itself, which is run through the Department of Health and Human Services, could be on the chopping block. Hours after his confirmation as head of the department this week, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hinted at firings in a televised interview.",
      "An HHS representative said in an email that \u201cthere are no current cuts, pauses, or disruptions to the Child Care and Development Block Grant.\u201d",
      "Still, Hendrickson said she\u2019s wondering, \u201cDo I continue to do this, or do I look for a different job?\u201d She added: \u201cIt really just makes me nervous that I will be able to maintain my program and my business, and my life\u2019s work.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION: (Feb. 16, 2025, 11:40 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the last name of the owner of Corrine\u2019s Little Explorers. She is Corrine Hendrickson, not Hendricks."

    "story": [
      "The past week has left America\u2019s European allies reeling and searching for alternatives after the Trump administration seemingly set itself in opposition to a rules-based system that the U.S. and its trans-Atlantic friends have spent decades building together.",
      "Not only did Vice President JD Vance wade into European politics, lambasting its leadership and interfering in Germany\u2019s upcoming election on behalf of its far right, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth all but nullified American military support for Ukraine, and President Donald Trump flirted with unilateral peace talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.",
      "While the U.S., as the West\u2019s superpower, and most of Europe \u2014 the European Union is an economic market of 500 million people \u2014 have spent the period since the end of World War II in political, military and commercial sync, the continent stands at the precipice of a generational change.",
      "Europe\u2019s leaders \u201ccannot accept the fact that what was the U.S.\u00a0is not the U.S. anymore,\u201d and that the continent could no longer call it an ally, former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin said in a briefing with reporters.",
      "\u201cIn the weeks and months, you will see the people of Europe waving their hand and asking from their government a very strong government,\u201d said de Villepin, who served under French President Jacques Chirac in the 2000s.",
      "With a blistering attack on Europe\u2019s culture, commitment to democracy, migration policies and the \u201cdanger from within,\u201d Vance\u2019s speech at the Munich Security Conference \u2014 which was supposed to focus on the war in Ukraine \u2014 tore up Washington\u2019s decadeslong alliances.",
      "Vance\u2019s silence on the almost three-year war also sent a clear message to Kyiv, according to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \u201cDecades of the old relationship between Europe and America are ending,\u201d he told the conference in Munich. \u201cFrom now on, things will be different, and Europe needs to adjust to that.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s dismissal of Ukraine spoke to the broader view that the U.S. no longer considers European involvement in negotiations with Russia as vital to peace talks.",
      "The Kremlin framed a recent phone call between Putin and Trump as a shift toward peace talks between Russia and the United States. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to travel to Saudi Arabia to initiate peace negotiations, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "Zelenskyy, still excluded from discussions in Saudi Arabia as of late Saturday, has been left sidelined, and European leaders shared the Ukrainian president\u2019s unease.",
      "After years of disunity and dithering, the leaders of the E.U. and the U.K. are worried they no longer have a seat at the table in negotiations that may reshape their ally\u2019s borders, and are set to gather in Paris this week for a summit on the war, in response to concerns the U.S. is moving ahead without them.",
      "\u201cEurope urgently needs its own plan of action concerning Ukraine, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Saturday. \u201cOr else other global players will decide about our future. Not necessarily in line with our own interests.\u201d",
      "Still, Ukraine is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the faltering rapport between Europe and the U.S. over policy and ideology. At the heart of Vance\u2019s speech was a direct attack on European democracy and culture.",
      "The vice president told the conference that he was worried less about the threats of Russia or China and more about \u201cthe retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Director of National Intelligence\u00a0Tulsi Gabbard took a different approach, somewhat muddying the waters in Munich by saying challenges from \u201cRussia, China, Iran and North Korea demand a united front.\u201d",
      "But analysts say Trumpist foreign policy \u2014 involving stopping almost all funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development and seeking to shake off Kyiv \u2014 may create an opportunity for America\u2019s rivals.",
      "China\u2019s foreign ministry responded on Saturday to events in Munich, saying it wants to \u201cstrengthen solidarity\u201d and \u201cpractice multilateralism\u201d with Germany and the European Union in what can only be read as thinly veiled comment on the Trump administration\u2019s capriciousness.",
      "Europe\u2019s leaders can expect more of the same, said Keir Giles, a senior fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank.",
      "\u201cIt would be astonishing if not just China, but other adversaries of Europe were not to take advantage of the split and the gaps this presents,\u201d Giles told NBC News.",
      "Meanwhile, Vance\u2019s criticism of European leaders for shunning far-right parties was taken as an endorsement of those parties, which are on the rise in Europe, especially in the context of his later meeting with Alice Weidel, co-leader of Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.",
      "The AfD is poised to play kingmaker in any coalition emerging from elections in Germany next week. There has long been a taboo against allying with the party, which has won the support of key Trump adviser Elon Musk.",
      "The normally mild-mannered German Chancellor Olaf Scholz accused Vance of interfering in Germany\u2019s elections. \u201cThat is not appropriate, especially not among friends and allies. We firmly reject that,\u201d he told the conference.",
      "Perhaps even more striking, Germany\u2019s conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz felt the need to publicly state that he expected the U.S. to respect the results of the upcoming elections.",
      "Even so, Europe\u2019s leaders had few reasons to be surprised despite Vance\u2019s ferocious attack, according to Chatham House\u2019s Giles.",
      "Giles told NBC News that Europe has ignored decades of signals that U.S. patience has been \u201cwearing thin\u201d with Europe\u2019s reliance on American defense and that Vance\u2019s rhetoric on immigration and his outreach to the far right would resonate with European voters.",
      "Both Vance and Hegseth this week echoed Trump\u2019s long-standing view that Europe should contribute more toward its own defense.",
      "In the latest consequence of that policy, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was preparing to raise his country\u2019s defense spending ahead of a visit to meet Trump, Britain\u2019s Sunday Times\u00a0newspaper reported.",
      "Starmer will hope to win favor in Washington with the funding boost when he visits at a crucial time for both the Ukraine talks and the political balance of its E.U. neighbors.",
      "Next week, Germany goes to the polls in an election in which the AfD is expected to perform well. It may be the first test for the shifts that Vance described in Munich.",
      "The schism \u201cis not invented out of thin air,\u201d Giles said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason populist parties across the continent tap into a deep vein of frustration with Europe\u2019s elites.\u201d"

      "He and his wife, Sandy, had raised their six children and 600 dairy cows on the 253-acre property in Port Townsend, Washington. When they sold the cows in 2003 to focus on producing beef and topsoil, he said he mourned the animals\u2019 loss for the next two years.",
      "Short, 82, is first to admit the land is \u201ca difficult place to farm.\u201d As he grew older and lost his eyesight, he worried about finding a buyer for it. But he was resolved on one thing \u2014 that his farm should stay a farm. So in 2016, he secured what\u2019s known as a conservation easement, a type of legal agreement that required his property, some of which floods or lacks irrigation, to remain a farm forever.",
      "That posed some challenges, said Eron Berg, executive director of the Port of Port Townsend. If the easement \u201chadn\u2019t been there, this farm could have been sold in six 40-acre parcels,\u201d he said, and \u201cyounger, newer farmers might have been able to afford to do something.\u201d Instead, the port bought the property for $1.4 million so it could lease parts to local growers.",
      "The predicament is mirrored across the country as the next generation of farmers confronts a growing inventory of protected farmland that doesn\u2019t always suit their needs or budgets. That\u2019s leaving many acres underutilized at a time when the U.S. is steadily losing farmland and the agriculture industry keeps consolidating into ever fewer, larger farms."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration continued its string of firings across several federal agencies, including the departments of Transportation and Justice. But the moves are coming so quickly and creating such difficulty for some agencies that they are having to try to un-fire people in some cases.",
      "According to a letter obtained by NBC News, dozens of probationary Transportation Department employees were sent letters that said part of the reason they were being fired was for poor performance.

    "story": [
      "With homes vandalized, synagogues on fire and residents on edge, Australia is grappling with a surge in antisemitic attacks that has prompted dozens of arrests across the country in what its leaders say is a \u201cnational crisis.\u201d",
      "Australian lawmakers and experts say there has been a rise in both antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Between the start of the war and September 2024, there were more than 2,000 antisemitic incidents in Australia, three times the figure for the same period a year earlier, according to a report in December by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Australian affiliate of the World Jewish Congress.",
      "Over the past 16 months, Jewish Australians have faced \u201can unprecedented rise in antisemitism across the country,\u201d according to a parliamentary inquiry report tabled Wednesday.",
      "Homes, cars and schools have been set on fire or spray-painted with anti-Israel messages, and there have been arson attacks against a synagogue in Melbourne and a child care center in Sydney. Last month, police said they had disrupted a potential antisemitic attack after they discovered a caravan containing explosives in a Sydney suburb.",
      "This week, two nurses in a Sydney hospital were suspended for saying they would kill Jewish patients or refuse to treat them in a video chat with a TikTok user who told them he was from Israel.",
      "The Australian government\u2019s response to the antisemitic incidents has been criticized by Jewish groups as well as Israel.",
      "\u201cThe epidemic of antisemitism is spreading in Australia almost unchecked,\u201d Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar said on the social media platform X last month. \u201cWe expect the Australian government to do more to stop this disease!\u201d",
      "Last week, Australian lawmakers almost unanimously passed tough hate crime laws that include mandatory jail time for giving a Nazi salute in public.",
      "\u201cWe want people who are engaged in antisemitic activities to be caught, to be charged and to be put in the clink,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton agreed. \u201cThis is a time of national crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "The laws have been welcomed by Jewish communities.",
      "\u201cPrison sentences and fines are called for if there is to be any hope of stamping out this hateful behavior,\u201d the Executive Council of Australian Jewry said in a statement last week. A home formerly owned by the group\u2019s co-chief executive was among those targeted.",
      "The attacks have been concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia\u2019s most populous cities and home to 85% of the country\u2019s Jewish population.",
      "Most of them have been \u201csmall-scale, low-technology attacks,\u201d said Julian Droogan, head of the Department of Security Studies at Macquarie University in Sydney.",
      "An exception was the trailer laden with explosives, which Droogan said \u201cwas quite remarkable and almost without precedent in recent years.\u201d",
      "While police have arrested dozens of Australians in connection with the arson, they have also said they are investigating whether the attacks could be part of a large-scale concerted effort by foreign actors paying criminals for hire.",
      "\u201cSo part of our inquiries include: Who is paying those criminals, where those people are, whether they are in Australia or offshore, and what their motivation is,\u201d Australia Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said last month.",
      "Local police are enhancing their efforts as well. This month, police in New South Wales, the Australian state that includes Sydney, said they had doubled to 40 the number of investigators on a task force formed to investigate antisemitic crimes and patrol schools and places of worship.",
      "\u201cChildren shouldn\u2019t feel scared to go to school, people shouldn\u2019t feel afraid to go to prayer or practice their religion,\u201d Commissioner Karen Webb said in a statement.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war and protests around it have been a sensitive issue in Australia, where some rallies have devolved into clashes between protesters and police officers.",
      "In October, police in New South Wales cited security risks and policing costs in trying to ban a pro-Palestinian rally marking the one-year anniversary of the start of the war, which has killed about 1,200 people in Israel and more than 46,000 people in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\u201cWe often look at Australia as geographically detached, and it is. But we forget to mention that the rest of the world is represented within Australia in microcosm,\u201d Droogan said. \u201cSo conflicts and disputes in the world regularly manifest in the Australian community.\u201d",
      "The tensions have extended to Australian schools, with multiple universities urging pro-Palestinian protesters to shut down encampments similar to those set up on campuses in the United States.",
      "There have been increased reports at universities of antisemitic graffiti, protests and chants, according to the parliamentary inquiry report, which urged universities to adjust their definition of antisemitism to more closely align with one that Palestinians and some civil rights groups say mutes criticism of Israel.",
      "Some Jewish groups say that in an attempt to address growing antisemitism, lawmakers and university campuses have instead politicized the issue and worsened prejudice against Palestinians and other groups.",
      "\u201cTo address antisemitism on campus, we must also address the racism faced by other racialized groups, including First Nations, Palestinian, Muslim, Arab, and Asian staff and students,\u201d Sarah Schwartz, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, said in a statement Friday."

    "story": [
      "VIENNA \u2014 Austrian authorities said the stabbing of six people that left a 14-year-old boy dead was carried out by a man with possible connections to the Islamic State group who appeared to have acted alone.",
      "The suspect, a 23-year-old Syrian, was arrested after the attack, which took place on Saturday afternoon in the center of the southern city of Villach, close to the main square. Police said he used a folding knife. Those wounded were two 15-year-old boys and men aged 28, 32 and 36. Two were seriously wounded and two others are also still receiving hospital treatment, while one was treated for minor injuries.",
      "\u201cThis is an Islamist attack with an IS connection by an attacker who radicalized himself within a very short time via the internet,\u201d Interior Minister Gerhard Karner told reporters in Villach Sunday.",
      "State Gov. Peter Kaiser thanked a 42-year-old man, also a Syrian, working for a food delivery company who drove toward the suspect and helped prevent the situation from getting worse. \u201cThis shows how closely terrorist evil but also human good can be united in one and the same nationality,\u201d he said.",
      "As the focus shifted to migration and asylum-seekers, Karner said that it will ultimately be necessary to \u201ccarry out a mass screening without cause, because this assassin was not conspicuous.\u201d",
      "He did not elaborate on his plans. It was unclear how long the suspect had been in Austria, although authorities said he had a residence permit. Austria\u2019s far-right leader Herbert Kickl, whose party won a national election four months ago, called for \u201ca rigorous crackdown on asylum\u201d in the wake of the attack.",
      "On Sunday, Kickl said that since all other parties in Austria had failed to implement the necessary asylum restrictions, it is crucial for his party to control the Interior Ministry \u2014 which is in charge of asylum and migration \u2014 in any future government.",

      "This marks the second deadly extremist attack in Austria in recent years. In November 2020, a man who had previously attempted to join the Islamic State group carried out a rampage in Vienna, armed with an automatic rifle and a fake explosive vest, killing four people before being fatally shot by police.",
      "Last August, authorities foiled an attack on Taylor Swift shows in Vienna that was inspired by the Islamic State group.",

      "Associated Press journalists witnessed scores of residents cheering on the M23 rebels in central Bukavu on Sunday morning as they walked and drove around the city center after a dayslong march from the region\u2019s major city of Goma 63 miles away, which they captured late last month. Several parts of the city, however, remained deserted with residents indoors.",
      "The M23 rebels are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, and are supported by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to the U.N.",
      "It was not clear if the rebels had taken decisive control of the city of about 1.3 million people. Their presence in central Bukavu is an unprecedented expansion of the rebels\u2019 reach in\u00a0their yearslong fighting with Congolese forces. Unlike in 2012 when they only seized Goma in the fighting connected to ethnic tension, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power.",
      "Many Congolese soldiers were seen on Saturday fleeing the rebels\u2019 advance into Bukavu alongside thousands of civilians amid widespread looting and panic.",
      "Congo\u2019s President Felix Tshisekedi held a security meeting in the faraway capital of Kinshasa, where officials noted that Bukavu was \u201cbriefly\u201d invaded by M23 but remains under the control of the Congolese army and allies from local militia, the presidency said on X. There were no signs of fighting or of Congolese forces in most parts of Bukavu on Sunday.",
      "Tshisekedi has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict. Congo\u2019s forces are being supported in Bukavu by troops from Burundi and in Goma by troops from South Africa.",
      "Burundi\u2019s president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest his country will not retaliate in the fighting. In a post on X he said that \u201cthose people who were ready to get profit of the armed attack of Rwanda to Burundi will not see this.\u201d",
      "The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, said it was committed to \u201cdefending the people of Bukavu\u201d in a Saturday statement that did not acknowledge their presence in the city. \u201cWe call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,\u201d Lawrence Kanyuka, the alliance\u2019s spokesperson, said in a statement.",
      "The fighting in Congo\u00a0has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda says the group is \u201cfully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges."

      "The competition to name the twin cubs, born Aug. 15, launched Saturday following a celebratory ceremony attended by Hong Kong leader John Lee and other officials at Ocean Park, the theme park that houses the twins, their parents and two other\u00a0giant pandas that arrived from mainland China\u00a0last year. Residents can submit their suggestions via the park\u2019s website.",
      "Lee said the southern Chinese city now has the largest number of pandas in captivity outside of mainland China, and the cubs\u2019 names would be announced in the first half of this year.",

      "The panda carers said the female cub seemed more active than her male twin. She loves climbing the tree inside the enclosure and resting there while her brother likes to wander around and play with the plants. The male cub has been marked with two purple food-coloring spots on its back to distinguish it from his sister.",

      "But\u00a0caring for pandas in captivity is expensive. Ocean Park recorded a deficit of 71.6 million Hong Kong dollars ($9.2 million) last financial year, and in 2020 required a government relief fund to stay afloat. Observers are watching if taking care of six pandas will add to its burden or give it a chance to revive its business.",
      "Pong said raising pandas was about animal conservation and education, instead of \u201cjust a money exercise.\u201d",
      "Pandas are considered China\u2019s unofficial national mascot. The country\u2019s giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing\u2019s soft-power diplomacy."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 An IRS employee who is affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency is expected to seek access to an IRS system that houses sensitive taxpayer information, according to an administration official.",
      "The access would be to the Integrated Data Retrieval System, which allows IRS employees to access taxpayer accounts. An administration official originally said that the employee had been granted access but later clarified that the employee was expected to seek access and was not already in the system.",
      "The IDRS\u00a0allows employees to have \u201cinstantaneous visual access to certain taxpayer accounts,\u201d according to the IRS website. The system can be used for \u201cresearching account information and requesting returns\u201d and \u201cautomatically generating notices, collection documents and other outputs.\u201d",

They are not allowed to access the accounts of people with whom they have personal or financial interests, such as friends and relatives, according to an IRS document.",
      "The DOGE-affiliated person in question is an IRS employee who started after President Donald Trump's second inauguration, the administration official confirmed to NBC News. The official said the employee was carrying out the \"DOGE mission\" and acting \u201clegally and with the appropriate security clearances.\u201d",
      "\"Waste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said when asked about the employee's potential access to the sensitive system. \"It takes direct access to the system to identify and fix it.",
      "\"DOGE will continue to shine a light on the fraud they uncover as the American people deserve to know what their government has been spending their hard-earned tax dollars on,\" Fields added.",
      "The IRS did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday evening.",
      "The move, first reported by The Washington Post, is an expansion of DOGE's efforts to access sensitive information held by the federal government.",
      "DOGE, headed by Elon Musk, has zeroed in on several government agencies and departments in an effort to cut what the administration paints as wasteful spending. DOGE has aimed to cut members of the federal workforce.",

      "The group has also taken aim at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "CORRECTION (Feb. 16, 2025, 10:59 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article cited an administration official incorrectly saying a DOGE-affiliated IRS employee accessed an internal system housing taxpayer information. That employee is expected to seek access to the system, the official said, but had not yet accessed it."

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 01:51:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The Trump administration terminated hundreds of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including fellows responsible for key public health roles, sources said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Saturday terminated hundreds of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including fellows responsible for key public health roles, according to two sources at the agency who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern over retaliation.",
      "Among them were about two dozen workers who made up the\u00a0Laboratory Leadership Service, or LLS, a group responsible for training public health laboratory staffers and supporting outbreak response efforts. The two-year fellowship program launched in 2015, focusing on laboratory safety and regulatory compliance.",
      "\u201cWe have come up with a new slogan for LLS: \u2018the disease detectors.\u2019 If you\u2019re not testing, you don\u2019t know what disease is there,\u201d a current fellow, who was among those who received termination notices, told NBC News.",
      "Termination emails, which were sent to LLS staff members Saturday evening, cited poor performance as the reason for the firings, even though most of the dismissed employees have \u201cexcellent\u201d performance reviews, a midlevel CDC official said.",
      "Multiple outlets reported that a larger sister program at CDC called the Epidemic Intelligence Service, or EIS, known as the agency\u2019s \u201cdisease detectives,\u201d was expected to be cut significantly, as well. As of Sunday, though, the two officials who spoke to NBC News had not heard of firings at EIS. One, a senior CDC official, said everyone who was going to be terminated had been notified by Sunday.",
      "\"Even if EIS was spared, there are multiple other fellowships that were not, and that's a pipeline for the next generation of CDC leaders,\" the senior official said. \"We're being cut off at the knees. It is going to cripple public health for decades.\"",
      "Other departments that had cuts included the Presidential Management Fellows, which aims to develop future public health leaders, and the Public Health Associate Program, which assigns fellows to local health agencies, the two officials said.",
      "The termination process has been marked by chaos and a lack of transparency.",
      "Almost two weeks ago, the Office of Personnel Management assigned CDC leadership to look through a list of employees who were in probationary or term-limited positions \u2014 including new directors, fellows and highly skilled noncitizen scientists \u2014 and designate each as \u201cmust be retained,\u201d \u201cmission critical\u201d or \u201cnot mission critical.\u201d According to the two CDC officials, the lists did not appear to have been used in the ultimate firing decisions.",
      "Representatives for the White House, the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately reply to requests for comment.",
      "In recent years, LLS fellows have assisted with dengue fever testing in American Samoa and Oropouche virus testing in Florida. In 2020, the group oversaw Covid-19 testing for thousands of Arizona residents.",
      "The LLS fellows who received the termination notice said their co-workers were less concerned about their jobs than about what the moves signaled for public health.",
      "\"A lot of us, we could have gone to more lucrative careers,\" said the fellow, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern of compromising their remaining weeks of paid leave. \"We could have worked for pharma. We could have worked for biotech or something like that and made so much more money. But we're all passionate for public health and just want to see public health succeed.\"",
      "The dismissal messages were sent the day after the Trump administration informed CDC leaders of plans to fire nearly 1,300 probationary employees at the agency, roughly one-tenth of its total workforce.",
      "A representative for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, previously said the cuts were a part of the administration\u2019s larger effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce.",
      "\u201cHHS is following the Administration\u2019s guidance and taking action to support the President\u2019s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government. This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard,\u201d Andrew Nixon, the department\u2019s director of communications, wrote.",
      "As part of broad-based cuts to the federal government implemented by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, the Office of Personnel Management officials last week directed leaders of federal agencies to dismiss probationary employees, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of people classified under that status. Since the directive was sent out, at least some probationary employees have been sent notices by the departments of Veterans Affairs and Transportation."

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 19:55:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Anthony Mackie and Mark Waid, the comic book writer who introduced the idea of the first Black Captain America, discuss the controversy surround the superhero.",
    "story": [
      "Anthony Mackie taking on the role of Captain America, a fictional comic book character initially portrayed as a white man with blond hair and blue eyes, isn\u2019t groundbreaking to comic books fans.",
      "The idea of a Black man as the patriotic superhero was introduced in 1998 by writer Mark Waid in the comic book \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty,\u201d where, according to Waid, Sam Wilson first \u201cpicked up the costume and took on the identity of Captain America.\u201d",
      "Over two decades after Sam Wilson became Cap in the comics, a Black Captain America in the movie adaptations has turned into a contentious topic.",
      "The issue of a Black Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe first arose after Chris Evans, who portrayed Cap on-screen for eight years, passed the mantle on to Mackie\u2019s Falcon in 2019\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d Fans were upset with Evans\u2019 departure and some felt Mackie wasn\u2019t capable of taking on the superpowered role.",
      "Though some eventually warmed up to the idea after seeing him in the 2021 critically acclaimed Disney+ series, \u201cFalcon and the Winter Soldier,\u201d where Mackie\u2019s Falcon grapples with the complicated notion of what it means for a Black man to be Captain America, the vitriol against actor ramped back up during his press run for \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World.\u201d",
      "During a Q&A in January, fans threatened to boycott the film and Mackie because of his comments on what he thinks Captain America represents that some deemed unpatriotic.",
      "\u201cCaptain America represents a lot of different things, and I don\u2019t think the term \u2018America\u2019 should be one of those representations. It\u2019s about a man who keeps his word and who has honor, dignity, and integrity. Someone who is trustworthy and dependable. This is like an aspect of a dream coming true,\u201d the actor said at the time.",
      "Following the backlash, Mackie has since clarified his comments online and in interviews, saying he\u2019s a \u201cproud American,\u201d and that Captain America is \u201cimportant for kids of all races\u201d so they can have someone to look up to regardless of their race.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com about some fans\u2019 mixed reaction following the first teaser of him as Cap, Mackie, 46, says he wasn\u2019t \u201caware\u201d that a Black Captain America had become so controversial.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s funny, because we all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America,\u201d Mackie says pragmatically.",
      "Though Mackie says he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any hesitations\u201d taking on the role in the MCU, Waid \u2014 who introduced the idea of Falcon becoming the first Black Captain America in the comics \u2014 admits there was \u201ca little bit of resistance\u201d from Marvel when he pitched it in the '90s.",
      "\u201cNot because anybody disbelieved the message,\u201d Waid, 62, tells TODAY.com. \u201cNot because anybody at Marvel was on the wrong side of history here, but just because when you\u2019re dealing with a corporate character like that it\u2019s going to go through many creators hands over his 80 years of existence.\u201d",
      "We all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America.\u201d",
      "Anthony mackie",
      "Captain America was first created in 1941 during World War II. Since then, an array of people have held the role in the comics, including women and people of color, like Sam Wilson.",
      "Waid explains that Marvel wanted him to be careful and not\u00a0\u201ctoo extreme\u201d since that could potentially \u201calienate\u201d a huge part of their audience. \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the money comes from,\u201d he explains.",
      "But Waid\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t just to make sure the comic\u2019s core readers were satisfied, it was also to authentically portray the Black experience. To do this, the comic book writer says he spoke to his real-life Black friends who made him see a different perspective of America, which included sentiments of \u201cracial hatred\u201d and \u201cbigotry.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018There is more of this going on than you realize \u2026 so just be mindful of that as you go into the story,\u2019\u201d he recalls them saying.",
      "Within Marvel, Waid says his story of Falcon taking on the mantle of Captain America \u201cwas very well received.\u201d But externally, he says there was \u201ca little bit of pushback\u201d from fandom and readers, with some saying, \u2018\u2018Well, this is not Captain America. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d",
      "Looking back, Waid says the pushback by fans wasn\u2019t so severe that he recalls \u201creceiving any hate mail\u201d about it. But he suspects that if he had done this story today, \u201cpeople would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Waid notes that over the last 10 to 15 years, \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot more trolling, a lot more blow back. A lot of organized fandom full of angry white guys who are not happy that they are being quote, unquote, eclipsed by people of color, which is bulls--t.\u201d",
      "If we had done this story today, people would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Mark Waid, writer of \u00a0\u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty\u201d",
      "The tenured comic book writer says it comes as no surprise that some fans are upset and even threatening to boycott Marvel\u2019s TV shows and the movies, because \u201cthese are the same people who were up in arms about the comics.\u201d",
      "\u201cLuckily, they have been a small enough part of the audience where we didn\u2019t have to take them into account,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we lost tons of sales because these trolls were out there being actively, performatively angry about the replacement of Captain America by a Black man in a comic book. They weren\u2019t buying the comics anyway. They were just looking for something to be mad about.\u201d",
      "Waid\u2019s introduction of Sam Wilson (Falcon) as Captain America in the comic \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty #9\u201d unfolds in a time of \u201cgreat racial divide\u201d in America.",
      "Steve Rogers (Captain America) is trying to disassociate himself from white supremacists (Sons of Serpents) who are co-opting his name and image because they believe that Cap represents their cause, Waid explains.",
      "\u201c\u2018He\u2019s a blonde white guy with a strong jaw. He\u2019s showing you that this is what America should be,\u2019\u201d he says of their sentiments toward Rogers \u2014 who, during his fight to stop them, appears to get killed. It\u2019s at this juncture that \u201cSam Wilson realizes that someone has to pick up the mantle, someone has to pick up the shield, and someone has to fight to clear the name of Captain America.\u201d",
      "While the film is not exactly like the comics, there are similarities. Directed by Julius Onah, the film follows Falcon\u2019s fight to uncover a villainous plot against President Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford) while also helping to exonerate Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) \u2014 a war vet who is turned into a Super Soldier after undergoing human testings by the government \u2014 who was accused of being involved. Some fans have argued that Bradley is the first Black Captain America since he took the Super Solider serum like Cap. Mackie says Sam's sense of integrity and dedication to justice is what he leans into and tries to embody with his titular role.",
      "\u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us,\u201d Mackie tells TODAY.com. \u201cSam didn\u2019t take the (Super Soldier) serum. Sam isn\u2019t a Super Soldier. He\u2019s just a good human being, and I think that\u2019s why we all kind of are endeared to him and kind of appreciate him, because we can see the best of us in him.\u201d",
      "One thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us.\"",
      "Anthony Mackie",
      "Since its first publication in March 1941, Waid says Captain America has had a simple, altruistic purpose: he represented the American dream and showed that it was attainable. But he says Cap\u2019s mission has \u201cchanged\u201d over the years.",
      "\u201cAmerica was the land of opportunity,\u201d Waid tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd clearly it has not always been that way for some people \u2026 And I think that Captain America today stands for equality. He stands for making sure that anyone in this country has an opportunity at bettering themselves and has an opportunity to have the best life possible \u2014 if they\u2019re willing to put the work into it.\u201d",
      "And Anthony Mackie has put that work in with his over two decades in Hollywood and 10 years playing Sam Wilson. Still, even with his tenure, there will still be those who take issue with there being a Black Captain America.",
      "Mackie even gave a nod to the pressure of taking on Cap\u2019s mantle in the film. In an exchange with President Ross following the attack on his life, Mackie\u2019s Sam tells the president that he overwhelmingly understands what he\u2019s going through.",
      "\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to feel you have something to prove,\u201d he says.",
      "Later in the film, Mackie is seen grappling with his past decision to reject the Super Soldier serum and also the pressure that he\u2019s under if he fails his mission.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m not on point, I let everyone who wants a seat at that table down,\u201d he says to his First Lieutenant Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), who takes on Sam's former mantle of Falcon. \u201cThat\u2019s pressure. It makes you feel that you\u2019re not enough.\u201d",
      "The \"Captain America\" comic book writer says there\u2019s always been room\u00a0for the character to change, evolve and represent something more inclusive.",
      "\u201cCaptain America can be an Asian man. Captain America can be a woman. Captain America could be anyone who stands for the ideals that Captain America stands for,\u201d Waid explains, noting that he hopes Cap\u2019s fight eventually \u201cgets easier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs long as they\u2019re an American at heart and fight for the American way \u2026 the way we wish truly was the dream as opposed to what racism and bigotry has sort of poisoned that well.\u201d",
      "Mackie agrees, noting that his Captain America leads with two important things: \u201cCompassion and empathy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like today, we could all use a little compassion and empathy,\u201d he adds.",

Within seven months, Coleman officially became a pilot, making her the first Black woman to do so.",

    "story": [
      "\"The White Lotus\" is back, and so is Belinda, the resort masseuse played by Natasha Rothwell.",
      "Season 3 of the Emmy-winning HBO series will look sparkling new in a lot of ways \u2014 from its new set of characters to its Thailand location. But not everyone will be unfamiliar, particularly if you\u2019ve watched Season 1.",
      "One of the first season\u2019s most sympathetic characters, Belinda's storyline wrapped in a bittersweet way. Not only is she returning \u2014 she\u2019s also a guest at the resort, rather than an employee, this season.",
      "Below, we'll go over who Belinda is and what we should know about her before Season 3 premieres.",
      "What happens to Belinda in Season 1 of \u2018The White Lotus\u2019?",
      "Belinda Lindsey manages the resort spa at the White Lotus resort in Maui, Hawaii, and so has a hospitality spirit that keeps her privileged, often spoiled guests from getting upset.",
      "She bonds with guest Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge) primarily, revealing that she\u2019s low-key, empathetic and even a bit spiritual.",
      "Afterward, she and Tanya have a few conversations about opening a wellness business together (funded largely by Tanya). Alas, Tanya\u2019s attention soon turns to her new boyfriend, local sport fisherman Greg. She blows off a dinner with Belinda \u2014 and chooses to invest herself, and her money, in his plans.",
      "Shattered when Tanya abandons their shared dream, Belinda is buoyed slightly when the guest hands her an envelope stuffed with cash. It\u2019s not what she hoped for, but it\u2019s still better than nothing.",
      "What\u2019s Belinda\u2019s storyline in Season 3?",
      "To be determined. According to what Rothwell told Entertainment Weekly, Tanya is still an employee of The White Lotus but is \u201cin Thailand doing sort of an exchange program to learn more about the wellness programs that the Thailand White Lotus offers.\u201d",
      "In that capacity, Tanya is both employee and guest, but she\u2019ll get to take classes while she\u2019s there and enjoy the hotel\u2019s amenities.",
      "As a \u201cdownstairs\u201d employee hanging out with the \u201cupstairs\u201d folks, she\u2019ll likely empathize with the hotel workers, while also using her skills and charm to make friends with some of the guests.",
      "Expect class struggle between the haves and have-nots as she wanders the resort alongside a clutch of longtime friends vacationing together, a curious couple and two parents traveling with their three grown kids. It\u2019s a combination that echoes Season 1 of the series.",
      "The trailer does reveal that a robbery takes place and Belinda is shown urging someone to call the police. When someone quips, \u201cGo big or go home\u201d in the trailer, she responds knowingly, \u201c\u2026 in a g\u2014damn body bag.\u201d",
      "But as for her dreams \u2014 we think Belinda still has that wellness center dream. All she really needs from this vacation may be an angel investor!",
      "But we won\u2019t really know where she\u2019s going until after the show premieres.",
      "What has Natasha Rothwell said about returning?",
      "Belinda is still recovering from Tanya\u2019s (well-paid) ghosting, Rothwell told Entertainment Weekly \u201cShe was so devastated by Tanya taking what little hope she had and shattering it,\u201d says Rothwell.",
      "\u201cOver the course of the Italy (second) season of \u2018White Lotus\u2019 in the world that we\u2019ve created, she\u2019s been trying to dig herself out of that sadness and really be inspired again. Her purpose for coming to Thailand is to have a dream again.\u201d"

He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",
      "Daniel and Taylor",
      "Daniel Hastings and Taylor Haag matched each other\u2019s energy from their first conversation. He joked about proposing a few minutes into their chat and she playfully went along.

      "They also bonded over their love of Christmas. In Episode 5, they gifted each other Christmas ornaments and stockings and marveled over their similarities. \u201cThe Christmas thing means a lot to me,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBut even if it wasn\u2019t Christmas stuff, I feel like we were meant to find each other.\u201d",

But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",

      "Joey Leveille and Monica Danus\u2019 time in the pods was drama-free. Joey, a 35-year-old physician associate, and Monica, a 28-year-old digital marketer, seemed to only form a bond with each other.

In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",

      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",

      "After Madison ended things with Mason, she told Meg what happened. Meg confronted Mason in the pods at the end of Episode 5. She questioned if she was only there by \u201cdefault\u201d because Madison rejected him.",
      "He said he validated the \u201cwrong person\u201d because he was \u201cconfused\u201d at the time.",
      "When he said she was always his first choice, Meg replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t yesterday, just to be fair.\u201d She said he never affirmed his feelings for her until it was too late.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll never know if what you\u2019re saying is true because we don\u2019t get the opportunity for you to pick,\u201d she told him in Episode 6. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to get past that.\u201d",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:24:40 GMT",
    "summary": "What is performing or writing for \"Saturday Night Live\" really like? TODAY.com talked to past and present cast to learn what really goes on behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Shortly before \"NBC's Saturday Night\" lit up American TV sets on Oct. 11, 1975, producer Lorne Michaels and seven unknown actors and comedians appeared on \"The Tomorrow Show,\" a late-night talk show with Tom Snyder, to promote their new 90-minute variety series.",
      "\"We've got eight and we're hoping for two for it to really work,\" Michaels deadpanned to Snyder about his new cast. \"So, not all of these people will become stars.\"",
      "Sitting next to him? Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Gilda Radner, John Belushi and Laraine Newman. Despite Michaels' tongue-in-cheek prediction, they would, in fact, go on to become not only stars, but legends as the original Not Ready For Prime Time Players on the soon-to-be renamed \"Saturday Night Live.\"",
      "Now, 50 years later, the sketch comedy show has gone on to become the most Emmy-decorated television show in history, receiving countless nominations, awards and accolades. And in 2017, those original cast members were inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame.",
      "Defined by its satirical and often censor-defying comedy, along with performances by cutting-edge musicians and artists, \"SNL\" has been a touchstone of American pop culture for five decades. In that time, more than 160 cast members have come and gone, many of them going on to become legends in their own right.",
      "In honor of \"SNL's\" golden anniversary, TODAY.com sat down with past and present cast members to learn what really goes on behind the scenes of the late night show \u2014\u00a0from the anxiety to the exhilaration \u2014 what viewers at home might be surprised to find out, along with their take on the best character breaks and sketches that didn't go quite as planned.",
      "Here's what they revealed.",
      "Answers have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Laraine Newman (1975 to 1980)",
      "You can only be aware of the audience that's in the studio. There's no sense, at least from my experience, that there's millions of people watching.",
      "It's like everything I was trained to do at The Groundlings where we did sketches and were in place, in costume, doing the sketch, lights out, run off, change, get back down to your spot, lights up and do the next sketch. That's exactly what \"SNL\" is.",
      "What's heroic is that the set designers, they have four days to build sets for sketches that might not even make it to air. The craft of the look of the show, the work that goes into that, the thought that goes into it. The fact that the writers get to collaborate with every aspect \u2014 wardrobe, makeup, everything \u2014 to really optimize their material. I don't think there's any show like that.",
      "Lorne (Michaels) did not want us to laugh, and I never got close to laughing, except when Rodney Dangerfield hosted. We were doing a takeoff on the Woody Allen movie \"Manhattan\" called \"Manhasset.\" (Dangerfield) is saying, \"Tracy, don't go to Manhasset. I tell ya, it's rough. I got a waterbed and there was a guy at the bottom of it.\"",
      "Now, I'd heard that joke in read-through and the rehearsal and it still got me. If you watch it, you can't tell. But I am dying. It is everything I could do not to laugh.",
      "Nora Dunn (1985 to 1990)",
      "There's something about the camera coming on \u2014 you come to life. Because right before that, you're not. It's like your dead, and you're revived and it's a \"do-or-die\" situation. And you go, \"Well, I got here.\" I always tell myself, \"You got here. There's a reason that you are here.\"",
      "I don't think you do it. I think the other side does it. The lights do it. They go, \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ... boom!\" It just happens. You can't plan it.",
      "When you're watching a sketch, right behind that wall, someone's taking their clothes off and putting on a costume and having a wig grabbed off their head and put something else on it. You have to make those quick changes.",
      "You might be on with a guest star, the host, and you're like, \"Gotta get my clothes off!\" You're not naked, but next to naked. Every time there's a sketch on \"Saturday Night Live,\" there's all kinds of stuff going on in the background.",
      "We were not supposed to use cue cards, but we all did. But Lorne was like (imitating Michaels), \"They're there if you need them. That's why they're not there, because you don't know your lines.\"",
      "So, Jon (Lovitz) and I had to do a sketch with Charlton Heston. He needed glasses, but he said he didn't. He didn't wear glasses, so they had to make his cue cards huge. So, we had huge stacks of cue cards and we were doing an Egyptian scene. We're dressed up as a couple that's having pyramids built, and the cue card guy lost control of the cards. They spread all over the floor. Lorne was standing 15 feet away and he was furious. We just beelined away from Lorne because he was going to say (imitating Michaels), \"Well, someone didn't learn their lines.\" He was not happy with us.",
      "Kevin Nealon (1986 to 1995)",
      "It's unlike anything I've ever experienced before. It's like sitting in a rollercoaster car, right at the beginning, just anticipating and waiting for it all to happen. And it was a rollercoaster, there were ups and downs, it was crazy.",
      "I remember before I did my first sketch, it was \"Mr. Subliminal,\" and right before, Lorne Michaels comes up to me, puts his hand on my shoulder, and he said, \"Are you sure this is what you want?\" It was funny and it relaxed me a little bit.",
      "But I remember the excitement of the first show. I think The Pretenders were on, and I remember finishing a sketch, then running back to get made up and I'm hearing the band playing and I'm thinking, \"Oh my God,\" and I got filled with such energy and excitement that, \"This is it, man, this is live, this is 'Saturday Night Live.'\"",
      "I think the audience doesn't realize how small the studio is when they get there. And I don't think they realize that we're scrambling to figure out what sketches to cut from rehearsal, how to improve a sketch and what didn't work and what you're surprised that did work.",
      "But, also, I think a lot of times they don't realize how frightened we are about going out there.",
      "(Breaking character) was very rare for me and for a lot of people on our cast because, at the time, Lorne thought of that as being very \"hacky.\" Also, it was a disservice to the writer. If you put all this labor into writing a sketch and then people are breaking on it, it's like, \"Well, there goes that sketch.\"",
      "I did break with Chevy Chase on \"Weekend Update\" once, but that was one of the only times I ever broke in nine years.",
      "Molly Shannon (1995 to 2001)",
      "It's exhilaration. When I hosted, for example, right before you go on, you're in the back and you're with a stage manager and they're like, \"OK ... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...\" So, you're like, \"Ugh (clutches her stomach).\"",
      "I got advice when I hosted. Steve Higgins, a wonderful producer on the show was like, \"Take your time. You don't have to run out there. It's OK.\" So, I thought that was good advice. Set yourself on stage, take a deep breath. But, definitely, there's nerves. I would say, an excited, kind of nervous feeling.",
      "I remember years ago, when I did the show, we would all have dinner after the rehearsals, before the live show. And I remember, because we had the whole week of writing comedy sketches, rehearsing them at dinner, I felt like, \"Ugh, this is time to just relax before the big comedy show live at 11:30 p.m.\"",
      "But people would still be doing comedy bits at dinner, and I remember thinking I just wanted to talk seriously and not have anybody joke around, like, have a quiet dinner before we have to go do a show. I was like, \"No comedy bits at dinner, like, please, let's just eat.\"",
      "Will Ferrell and I were characters who had recently lost 100 pounds, and we were very excited about it. We did it center stage and Will Ferrell and I always had a deal that, if you bombed, if you were tanking, and people weren't laughing, you would still have to commit as an actor, pour your heart into it even more.",
      "While we're performing it, there were crickets, no laughter at all. I remember during the scene, looking at Will, we were like (grimace), but we just kept performing it like the greatest dramatic actors, and we thought it was so funny. So, it entertained us that you had to bomb with grace and dignity, to just jump into bombing and be OK with it. Scoring and bombing were on equal planes \u2014 you had to respect both.",
      "Cheri Oteri (1995 to 2000)",
      "I would always be in the bathroom. That's how fearful I was. I was always very nervous. It's sheer fear and excitement. But because you only get a chance to do it once, it's more fear for me. But I've always been like that, even when I did theater. I was always in the bathroom until it was like, \"10, 9, 8 ...\"",
      "We have a two-hour draft show at 8 o'clock, then a half hour is cut out of that and you're just ... nothing's ever settled until 11:30 p.m. You're working to get your sketches in during the week and you don't know if they're going to get in. And if they do get in, they could always be cut between dress and air.",
      "Nothing is guaranteed. So that's kind of hard. I always say it's a show that you audition for every week, that you already got.",
      "There was one time I broke and it was doing \"Morning Latte.\" It was with Jerry Seinfeld. In this sketch, Will (Ferrell) goes like this (makes hitting motion) with a book and it hits me in the head. That book hit me so hard in the head \u2014 but it didn't hurt. It just clocked. And because of the book being a hardcover, the sound just reverberated and the audience went, \"Ooohhh.\"",
      "I went back and I saw stars. I started laughing and I couldn't stop. Will had to say my lines. Tears are coming down, I'm laughing so much. I've never not been able to recover from something. But because I saw stars, I couldn't stop laughing.",
      "But it was dress, so on air, I knew it was coming. But that was the one and only time I broke.",
      "Ana Gasteyer (1996 to 2002)",
      "Those last 15 seconds right before you go live, I think it's largely fear. It's not fear, necessarily, about failing or anything like that, but it's all so last-minute that it's just your brain synthesizing what has inevitably changed in your sketch moments before you've started and the breakneck pace of it because it really is live.",
      "What people don't understand \u2014\u00a0it's live, and it's written that week, that minute, that day. We may have written a sketch on Tuesday night, but it got rewritten on Thursday. It got rewritten again on Friday and then rewritten before your dress.",
      "You may have just come off another experience, may have had a failed quick change or stressed moment because commercial breaks are only two minutes. They might feel long when you're at home, but two minutes is really, really, really fast to have to change an entire outfit and wig. So, what's happening in those 15 seconds is kind of rooting yourself in the space of what you're going to do.",
      "You know, when you're coming back from a commercial and you're at home and you're like, \"Gosh, why is this taking so long? Why am I looking at this picture of Ariana Grande for so incredibly long?\"",
      "That's because, wildly, some set has not been assembled. That's what those bumper (photo) cards are for, to buy a little bit of time on the edges of your returns.",
      "There was a sketch we did, a Sally Jessy Raphael with Christina Ricci. She had never done live television before, so she was really spooked and kind of addled, and maybe had a little champagne. There was a bad teen sketch and I was Sally Jessy, there was a fist fight.",
      "It looked bad at dress. Lorne, in the notes, between dress and air, was like, \u201cLet\u2019s work on that punch.\u201d We didn\u2019t have a fight coordinator, it was very unrehearsed and the depth perception was off. We got to air and (Christina) was so focused, and that fist hit my nose in such a dramatic, hilarious, painful ... I mean, in the moment I remember my Sally Jessy red signature frames went flying up off my face and landed in, like, slow motion. It was insane. It was like a full-face TKO. I remember just being like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to maintain the impression,\u201d because I was so nervous about my Sally Jessy impression the whole time.",
      "Rachel Dratch (1999 to 2006)",
      "It's kind of a mix. Definite excitement, nerves ... fear is a factor. Doing theater before \"SNL,\" the fear is kind of what drives you. So, the fear is good actually. But, overall, excitement.",
      "This is kind of common sense, but you don't think of it when you're watching at home: That in between when you're watching a commercial, all the madness is happening because it's live. Someone's changing costume, hair, someone can go from being a baby to an old man in that commercial. There's a team of people working \u2014\u00a0every person has their own hair, makeup and wardrobe person. So, there's this huge transformation taking place or the sets are being moved.",
      "A sketch that went wrong in the best way possible was the \"Debbie Downer at Disney World,\" where we started laughing. That's the one everyone seems to remember so well. People tell me they watch when they're sad to cheer them up and that makes me so happy.",
      "But, yes, of course, we try not to laugh on the show. But that one, knowing the camera was coming in every time after I was saying this total bummer fact, and trying to keep it together, it just shows that this show is live. If there's any doubt, things can go wrong. And sometimes it's very funny when they do.",
      "Amy Poehler (2001 to 2008)",
      "Performing on \"SNL\" feels like working in a comedy emergency room. So you are rushing around sometimes, sometimes things are slow. You are around trained professionals, you have high stakes and it feels often very life or death.",
      "There's so many surprising things about \"SNL\" that people wouldn't realize. It's such a unique unicorn of a show and the way it's put together. I think a lot of people don't realize how tired everyone is all the time, especially during read through, because people have stayed up all night and then go in and have to perform.",
      "I think people also don't realize how most of your time at \"SNL\" is wondering when your food is going to get there. That's about 75% of your brain space, \"When is my food going to come?\" So, I think a lot of people are thinking that when (viewers) are thinking that they're thinking about sketches.",
      "My first year on \"SNL,\" the great John Goodman hosted and was so nice to me, even though I was a lone freshman. I remember I did a sketch with Chris Kattan and I got flipped into a dumpster \u2014 on purpose. I think I kind of passed out for a second and then woke up and I remember thinking, \"I wonder if anyone's ever passed out on 'SNL'?'\" Then I thought, \"How long have I been in this dumpster?\" So, that was fun. That was a good entry into what was a wild ride.",
      "Mikey Day (2013 to Present)",
      "It's so week-to-week. That's how the show works. You could have a week when you're in everything, you could have a week where you have three lines and one thing. It all depends. So, I feel like the emotions vary depending on that week.",
      "However, one constant is that after, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night,\" and the band starts playing \u2014 that's when the adrenaline (starts) and I'm always reminded, \"Oh wow, it's 'SNL,'\" and I always get kind of a little high off that.",
      "There's so many heroes on that show. The crew, itself, is, like, Tetris because Studio 8H isn't that big. So, they're constantly moving and all the equipment feels like it's from the '70s. This stuff has that old-school feel in terms of its size and bulk, and moving it to and fro on Saturday is pretty crazy. But they make it work somehow.",
      "Also, the filmed pieces, they build those sets in a day \u2014 a literal day \u2014 and sometimes there's three films being shot in one week, which is wild.",
      "Most recently, it was \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" with Ryan Gosling. It was a lot of fun. Heidi (Gardner) broke, Ryan and I were laughing, giggling like two schoolboys.",
      "But I remember the first time I laughed and it was in an unpredictable sketch called \"Dog Head Man.\" It's like geneticists who have created Dog Head Man. It was so dumb. At dress they were feeding the dog some treat or something and the dog didn't really like it. We're like, \"Can we just give it bread?\" And then it just went to town on this bread and I started laughing because Sam Rockwell and I were talking about such heavy stuff, and you just see the dog is so happy, going to town on human food.",
      "Dog Head Man stands out as one that I remember as the first time I kind of lost it. It wasn't too bad, but when you start to go, you're like, \"Oh no, I haven't done this before, am I going to get in trouble?\"",
      "Heidi Gardner (2017 to present)",
      "It's all of those things, actually. But I always just remind myself to have fun, take a few deep breaths. I'm going to do my job, the words are going to come out. That's always the biggest fear: Am I just going to stop knowing how to read cue cards? But it happens.",
      "I had never seen the show as a fan \u2014 I was a fan, but I had never gone to it. I really didn't understand that it was all in the same studio. I thought \"Weekend Update\" was in a separate room, that you walked down the hall to \"Weekend Update,\" then you walk to a sketch, but it's all in the studio. So, those two-minute commercial breaks really are like just complete chaos. The most organized chaos in the world. And it's really its own art form to watch the crew navigate that.",
      "Well, obviously, \"Beavis and Butt-Head,\" but there was one last season I did with Kristen Wiig, where we were \"Mad Men\" type secretaries, and she was supposed to fall through a desk, like sit on a desk and it breaks away. And I was supposed to fall through a wall and both of us just didn't quite have the strength to break either one.",
      "So, she sat on the desk and it didn't break and then she had to hop down. I went into the wall and it didn't break. So it was very funny to try and navigate that live.",
      "Chloe Fineman (2019 to Present)",
      "Performing on \"SNL\" is truly a fever dream. After so many shows, I'm like, \"Wait, what? I was with who? And I kissed so and so?\" Or, \"I was on stage with Ariana Grande?\" It really runs the gamut. It's very surreal, I'd say.",
      "I think viewers at home would be surprised to learn about the machine that happens during the live show. Anytime I've had friends and family come, it's amazing to watch. The sets are running over here and we're running here and there's heels and this thing's getting taken apart and put together. It happens like clockwork and, really, so much can go wrong. For some reason, it doesn't and it's magic. To me, that's almost as entertaining as the show.",
      "We did a \"Cast Away\" sketch with Jason Momoa, and he was supposed to lift me up and we were supposed to pretend to, like, have our bodies move, but he's so much bigger than me and I'm so short and little, that I really was like, \"Woo!\" He really thrusted me in a way that took my breath away. Honestly, that's a favorite."

      "Stark arrived in the Bay Area for the game Feb. 13, just a few hours before his team was set to practice for the first time. His appearance in the game comes amid filming for the back half of Season 8 of \"9-1-1,\" which returns with new episodes March 6.",
      "\"To be quite honest with you, I finished filming about 4 a.m. last night, outside in the rain, so to then wake up and get on an 8 a.m. flight was a little challenging,\" he says. \"But '9-1-1' were actually super accommodating in making sure I was free to do this, but they did send me on my way with a night shoot.\"",

      "Season 7, Episode 4, which aired April 4, 2024, saw Buck deal with a newfound jealousy over his best friend Eddie's (Ryan Guzman) new friendship with Tommy (Louis Ferrigno Jr.) Later in the episode, Buck learns via Eddie's wall calendar that he and Tommy have plans to play pick-up basketball, which he decides to crash.",

After Eddie steals the ball, Buck chases him down before shoving him, fracturing Eddie's ankle. In the end, Tommy apologizes for excluding Buck, while Buck cops to feeling jealous and admitting he had been trying to get Tommy's attention.",

      "\"I think I'm trying to focus on, 'I'm just here to have fun,' but I do know that my competitive side will probably take over,\" he says. \"But listen, I might spend the whole game on the bench.\"",

      "This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "So listen, it's been a little while since I've played basketball competitively. I played a lot in high school, but that was some years ago. So as soon as I got the email about this, to be quite honest with you, I said, 'Yes.' I put my phone down. I went to the park, and I've pretty much been there ever since playing day in and day out, just to kind of get it back in my body a little bit.",
      "(Laughs) Well, I'll tell you, one of the things that I miscalculated was, you know, I'm 6' 2\", and so I thought that maybe, you know, for the kind of game that it is, that I might be on the taller side. But I'm actually one of the shorter players. So I'm going to put that as a weakness. And I'm going to put, and I say this tentatively, but sports IQ in my in my strengths column, and hope that works in my favor.",
      "Most of their reactions were to do with my somewhat injured knee that I've been struggling with for the past year. And basically everyone said, \"Is your knee going to be able to handle that?\" To which I said, \"I don't know. I guess we'll find out.\"",
      "But over the weeks of prepping for it, I feel good about it and having told that to them, they're all really excited. And they've all said to make sure I let them know exactly what network it's on, what time, and they're going to be cheering me on from back down in Los Angeles.",
      "\"9-1-1\" returns March 6 with Season 8, Episode 9, titled, \"Sob Stories.\" The midseason finale of the show left Buck reeling when Eddie told him he plans to move to El Paso to be closer to his son, Christopher. Buck has also been mourning the end of his relationship with Tommy, who broke up with Buck in Episode 6. Meanwhile, a trailer for the Season 8 return hints that Buck's sister, Maddie, is about to be kidnapped by a serial killer.",
      "Yeah, there's a ton of different stuff going on. There's a lot of tension  in the upcoming episodes between characters that we don't often see tension between. I think the stories across these (episodes), it's going to be quite a fraught and intense atmosphere for a good healthy portion of it. And that's not something that '9-1-1' tends to do, right? In general, our main cast, our main characters, are a pretty tight knit group, whereas we're going to be looking at what happens when you kind of start to tug at a thread, and you know, it keeps on pulling and pulling, and you kind of watch a lot of things unravel as that goes.",
      "Definitely, and I think they're going to be kind of explored and looked at in a way that is more obvious than kind of has ever been done before on the show. To an extent where I was actually surprised by the extent to which it's going to be explored. So, yeah, no, absolutely, that is to come very soon.",
      "Not that specifically. But just kind of an exploration of what the feelings are.",
      "Yeah... I'll say no more on that."

      "With homes vandalized, synagogues on fire and residents on edge, Australia is grappling with a surge in antisemitic attacks that has prompted dozens of arrests across the country in what its leaders say is a \u201cnational crisis.\u201d",
      "Australian lawmakers and experts say there has been a rise in both antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Between the start of the war and September 2024, there were more than 2,000 antisemitic incidents in Australia, three times the figure for the same period a year earlier, according to a report in December by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Australian affiliate of the World Jewish Congress.",
      "Over the past 16 months, Jewish Australians have faced \u201can unprecedented rise in antisemitism across the country,\u201d according to a parliamentary inquiry report tabled Wednesday.",
      "Homes, cars and schools have been set on fire or spray-painted with anti-Israel messages, and there have been arson attacks against a synagogue in Melbourne and a child care center in Sydney. Last month, police said they had disrupted a potential antisemitic attack after they discovered a caravan containing explosives in a Sydney suburb.",
      "This week, two nurses in a Sydney hospital were suspended for saying they would kill Jewish patients or refuse to treat them in a video chat with a TikTok user who told them he was from Israel.",
      "The Australian government\u2019s response to the antisemitic incidents has been criticized by Jewish groups as well as Israel.",
      "\u201cThe epidemic of antisemitism is spreading in Australia almost unchecked,\u201d Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar said on the social media platform X last month. \u201cWe expect the Australian government to do more to stop this disease!\u201d",
      "Last week, Australian lawmakers almost unanimously passed tough hate crime laws that include mandatory jail time for giving a Nazi salute in public.",
      "\u201cWe want people who are engaged in antisemitic activities to be caught, to be charged and to be put in the clink,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton agreed. \u201cThis is a time of national crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "The laws have been welcomed by Jewish communities.",
      "\u201cPrison sentences and fines are called for if there is to be any hope of stamping out this hateful behavior,\u201d the Executive Council of Australian Jewry said in a statement last week. A home formerly owned by the group\u2019s co-chief executive was among those targeted.",
      "The attacks have been concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia\u2019s most populous cities and home to 85% of the country\u2019s Jewish population.",
      "Most of them have been \u201csmall-scale, low-technology attacks,\u201d said Julian Droogan, head of the Department of Security Studies at Macquarie University in Sydney.",
      "An exception was the trailer laden with explosives, which Droogan said \u201cwas quite remarkable and almost without precedent in recent years.\u201d",
      "While police have arrested dozens of Australians in connection with the arson, they have also said they are investigating whether the attacks could be part of a large-scale concerted effort by foreign actors paying criminals for hire.",
      "\u201cSo part of our inquiries include: Who is paying those criminals, where those people are, whether they are in Australia or offshore, and what their motivation is,\u201d Australia Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said last month.",
      "Local police are enhancing their efforts as well. This month, police in New South Wales, the Australian state that includes Sydney, said they had doubled to 40 the number of investigators on a task force formed to investigate antisemitic crimes and patrol schools and places of worship.",
      "\u201cChildren shouldn\u2019t feel scared to go to school, people shouldn\u2019t feel afraid to go to prayer or practice their religion,\u201d Commissioner Karen Webb said in a statement.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war and protests around it have been a sensitive issue in Australia, where some rallies have devolved into clashes between protesters and police officers.",
      "In October, police in New South Wales cited security risks and policing costs in trying to ban a pro-Palestinian rally marking the one-year anniversary of the start of the war, which has killed about 1,200 people in Israel and more than 46,000 people in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\u201cWe often look at Australia as geographically detached, and it is. But we forget to mention that the rest of the world is represented within Australia in microcosm,\u201d Droogan said. \u201cSo conflicts and disputes in the world regularly manifest in the Australian community.\u201d",
      "The tensions have extended to Australian schools, with multiple universities urging pro-Palestinian protesters to shut down encampments similar to those set up on campuses in the United States.",
      "There have been increased reports at universities of antisemitic graffiti, protests and chants, according to the parliamentary inquiry report, which urged universities to adjust their definition of antisemitism to more closely align with one that Palestinians and some civil rights groups say mutes criticism of Israel.",
      "Some Jewish groups say that in an attempt to address growing antisemitism, lawmakers and university campuses have instead politicized the issue and worsened prejudice against Palestinians and other groups.",
      "\u201cTo address antisemitism on campus, we must also address the racism faced by other racialized groups, including First Nations, Palestinian, Muslim, Arab, and Asian staff and students,\u201d Sarah Schwartz, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, said in a statement Friday."

      "That threat was brought sharply into focus just over three years ago when ISIS launched a large attack on Al Sina Prison, killing dozens of guards and freeing hundreds of prisoners. Battles raged around the prison for over a week until they were eventually quelled with the help of the U.S. military.",
      "\u201cWe have intelligence that ISIS is planning to attack the prisons again, because the prisoners are considered to be a primary force for them,\u201d Abdi said. \u201cIf they find a way out, ISIS will be able to reorganize and reconstitute.\u201d",
      "Those concerns were repeatedly echoed by the U.S. military, which said in a statement last month that the prison population was \u201ca literal and figurative \u2018ISIS Army\u2019 in detention.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "For a country ravaged by two years of brutal civil war and with over 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance, President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan.",
      "As battles rage in the North African country, a network of communal kitchens has had to immediately stop most of its operations due to a lack of funding, about 75% of which came from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to their organizers.",
      "Part of Sudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs) \u2014\u00a0a civilian-led, grassroots effort to provide humanitarian support \u2014 the kitchens have been able to provide food, medicine and other basic supplies to people in parts of the country unreachable by aid agencies.",
      "Without the American funding \u201ca lot of people will die because of hunger,\u201d Abuzar Osman Suliman, the coordinator of the ERRs in Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region, told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Suliman, who said it cost $10,000 for a single kitchen in Darfur to feed 250 families for two weeks, gave a 10 to 20 day window for people to start dying.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 freezing foreign assistance, forcing American-funded aid and development programs worldwide to shut down and lay off staff.\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had sought to mitigate the damage by issuing a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs, but USAID officials and aid groups say neither funding nor staffing have been reinstated in order to allow even the most essential programs to start working again.",
      "In Sudan, Suliman said all 40 of ERRs\u2019 community kitchens had to close in Darfur\u2019s Zamzam camp, where more than 1 million displaced people have sought refuge from the conflict between the country\u2019s two main warring powers \u2014 the Sudanese Armed Forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.",
      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021. But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance spectacularly broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "Because of intense fighting and an ongoing RSF siege in the surrounding area, U.N. agencies have been unable to get substantial amounts of food relief to the Zamzam camp and a famine was declared in the camps in August, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an international system that sets a scale used by the United Nations and governments.\u00a0So people are now facing the choice between staying in the camp to die from hunger, or risk their lives by moving through Darfur areas besieged by the RSF, Suliman said.",
      "Famine has since spread to four other areas of Sudan, according to the IPC, and is expected to deepen and spread in coming months due to the war and impeded access to humanitarian assistance.",
      "In Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, intense block-by-block fighting has made aid delivery almost impossible.\u00a0The World Food Program said it was only able to deliver its first shipment in December, 20 months after the conflict erupted, and even then, it said it had to rely on the ERRs for distribution.",
      "Across Khartoum, the ERRs were operating 742 kitchens and serving around 816,000 people before Trump's executive order, but now 80% of those kitchens have closed, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the Emergency Response Rooms.",
      "In a country riven by ethnic and political divisions, the ERRs have espoused neutrality and solidarity, allowing them to operate in areas controlled by SAF as well as the RSF, leveraging local know-how to navigate hostile terrain.",
      "The kitchens are organized locally and entirely volunteer-led, Kuka said, adding the whole ERR system was run by housewives, doctors, engineers, electricians \u2014 \u201cjust everybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis minute, I\u2019m trying to save the lives of the people in the district and the volunteers,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just, like, going crazy trying to get any money.\u201d",
      "Without immediate funding, famine could take hold in the city, he added.",
      "Because USAID was often distributing money through other nongovernmental organizations working in Sudan, Kuka said the ERR organizers weren\u2019t always aware of how crucial USAID was to their funding, until the money was taken away.",
      "On Friday, Kuka said he found out that a $50,000 grant he expected from the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services (CRS) had been suddenly canceled because of the U.S. freeze.",
      "The humanitarian agency told NBC News they could not comment on the grant cancellation.",
      "CRS, which has about 5,000 employees, told staffers last week to expect layoffs because of the administration\u2019s cuts to their foreign aid grants, according to Reuters. The organization has a $1.5 billion budget, about half of it funded by USAID.",
      "Across Sudan, the cost of operating the kitchens was around $20 million a year, the ERR communications officer said. But the localized ad-hoc nature of the work is also what made them so vulnerable to U.S. funding cuts, Kuka added.",
      "While U.N. agencies may have several months of supplies in the pipeline, the ERRs often relied on purchasing goods directly from local markets. So when the cash flow was cut off, the kitchens could no longer buy and cook food.Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official and country representative in Sudan, said the exemption issued by Rubio was \u201cvery complicated, nobody really knows how it works.\u201d",
      "Tracy, who is currently vice president of Proximity 2 Humanity, a nonprofit working to shore up funding for Sudan\u2019s ERRs, added that some agencies might be big enough to continue operations, relying on a future reimbursement if an exemption is granted, but a lot of smaller organizations can\u2019t do that.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge paused an order putting USAID staff on administrative leave, but Tracy said it is still not clear to what capacity the agency will be able to operate.",
      "\u201cIn theory they have a week where they\u2019re able to work again \u2014access to emails, etc. \u2014 but what they could do before this was heavily curtailed, so unclear as to how much they can do, like make payments.\u201d",
      "Kuka said he is also appealing to any other institutional donors to fill in the funding gaps, using what little they have left to support emergency assistance programs.",
      "\u201cAfter a month, it will be completely done,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cWe agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other\u2019s Nations,\u201d Trump wrote Wednesday on Truth Social after the call. \u201cWe have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.\u201d",
      "Senior Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Rubio and the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, have been huddling in Germany this weekend for the Munich Security Conference, a forum for international security policy where the Russia-Ukraine war remains a critical topic of discussion.",
      "Rubio spoke by phone with Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday. Their discussion included the war in Ukraine and other topics, according to readouts of the call from both countries.",
      "In a speech at the security conference Saturday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine must be involved with any negotiations to end the war.",
      "\"Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs,\" he said. \"No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine, no decisions about Europe without Europe.\"",
      "Rubio said in an interview Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that \"the Europeans will have to be involved\" in negotiations about the end of the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"If it\u2019s real negotiations, and we\u2019re not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved because they\u2019re the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they\u2019re the \u2014 they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and they\u2019ve contributed to this effort,\" Rubio said.",
      "During a panel discussion Saturday on the sidelines of the conference, Kellogg said that \u201cof course\u201d Ukrainians would be at the table in discussions to end the war. However, he said \u201cthe answer is no\u201d when he was asked whether he could assure Europeans that they, too, would have a seat at the table.",
      "\u201cWhen you sit at the table, there\u2019s really, there\u2019s two protagonists when you look at it, and there\u2019s one, hopefully it\u2019ll be an intermediary,\u201d Kellogg added. When the moderator asked for clarification, he indicated that Ukrainians, Russians and Americans would be \u201cat the table talking.\u201d",
      "He later said a group\u2019s not being at the table \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the interests are not taking a part of, they\u2019re not considered, they\u2019re not used, they\u2019re not developed.\u201d",
      "An aide close to Zelenskyy said that as of Saturday evening, Ukraine has still not been invited to the peace talks between the United States and Russia in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"It is dangerous to speak with enemies before you speak with allies,\" the aide added. \"Ukraine\u2019s position remains unchanged: We need to have a joint position of Ukraine, the U.S. and Europe before any negotiations with Putin.\u201d",
      "Two U.S. officials confirmed that Ukraine was not invited to the talks in Saudi Arabia but said the intention is for the United States to host a bilaterial meeting with Russia, then a bilateral meeting with Ukraine and then talks together.",

      "\u201cAs far as the negotiation, it\u2019s too early to say what\u2019s going to happen. Maybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won\u2019t, and it\u2019s all dependent on what is going to happen,\u201d he said at a news conference alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",

    "story": [
      "VIENNA \u2014 Austrian authorities said the stabbing of six people that left a 14-year-old boy dead was carried out by a man with possible connections to the Islamic State group who appeared to have acted alone.",
      "The suspect, a 23-year-old Syrian, was arrested after the attack, which took place on Saturday afternoon in the center of the southern city of Villach, close to the main square. Police said he used a folding knife. Those wounded were two 15-year-old boys and men aged 28, 32 and 36. Two were seriously wounded and two others are also still receiving hospital treatment, while one was treated for minor injuries.",
      "\u201cThis is an Islamist attack with an IS connection by an attacker who radicalized himself within a very short time via the internet,\u201d Interior Minister Gerhard Karner told reporters in Villach Sunday.",
      "State Gov. Peter Kaiser thanked a 42-year-old man, also a Syrian, working for a food delivery company who drove toward the suspect and helped prevent the situation from getting worse. \u201cThis shows how closely terrorist evil but also human good can be united in one and the same nationality,\u201d he said.",
      "As the focus shifted to migration and asylum-seekers, Karner said that it will ultimately be necessary to \u201ccarry out a mass screening without cause, because this assassin was not conspicuous.\u201d",
      "He did not elaborate on his plans. It was unclear how long the suspect had been in Austria, although authorities said he had a residence permit. Austria\u2019s far-right leader Herbert Kickl, whose party won a national election four months ago, called for \u201ca rigorous crackdown on asylum\u201d in the wake of the attack.",

We are grateful to have found asylum and protection in Austria,\u201d the association said.",

      "\u201cAt the same time, I am angry \u2014 angry at those politicians who have allowed stabbings, rapes, gang wars and other capital crimes to become the order of the day in Austria. This is a first-class failure of the system, for which a young man in Villach has now had to pay with his life,\u201d Kickl said.",

      "Not only did Vice President JD Vance wade into European politics, lambasting its leadership and interfering in Germany\u2019s upcoming election on behalf of its far right, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth all but nullified American military support for Ukraine, and President Donald Trump flirted with unilateral peace talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.",
      "While the U.S., as the West\u2019s superpower, and most of Europe \u2014 the European Union is an economic market of 500 million people \u2014 have spent the period since the end of World War II in political, military and commercial sync, the continent stands at the precipice of a generational change.",

      "\u201cIn the weeks and months, you will see the people of Europe waving their hand and asking from their government a very strong government,\u201d said de Villepin, who served under French President Jacques Chirac in the 2000s.",

      "Vance\u2019s silence on the almost three-year war also sent a clear message to Kyiv, according to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \u201cDecades of the old relationship between Europe and America are ending,\u201d he told the conference in Munich. \u201cFrom now on, things will be different, and Europe needs to adjust to that.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s dismissal of Ukraine spoke to the broader view that the U.S. no longer considers European involvement in negotiations with Russia as vital to peace talks.",

      "After years of disunity and dithering, the leaders of the E.U. and the U.K. are worried they no longer have a seat at the table in negotiations that may reshape their ally\u2019s borders, and are set to gather in Paris this week for a summit on the war, in response to concerns the U.S. is moving ahead without them.",
      "\u201cEurope urgently needs its own plan of action concerning Ukraine, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Saturday. \u201cOr else other global players will decide about our future. Not necessarily in line with our own interests.\u201d",
      "Still, Ukraine is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the faltering rapport between Europe and the U.S. over policy and ideology. At the heart of Vance\u2019s speech was a direct attack on European democracy and culture.",
      "The vice president told the conference that he was worried less about the threats of Russia or China and more about \u201cthe retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.\u201d",

      "Associated Press journalists witnessed scores of residents cheering on the M23 rebels in central Bukavu on Sunday morning as they walked and drove around the city center after a dayslong march from the region\u2019s major city of Goma 63 miles away, which they captured late last month. Several parts of the city, however, remained deserted with residents indoors.",
      "The M23 rebels are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, and are supported by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to the U.N.",
      "It was not clear if the rebels had taken decisive control of the city of about 1.3 million people. Their presence in central Bukavu is an unprecedented expansion of the rebels\u2019 reach in\u00a0their yearslong fighting with Congolese forces. Unlike in 2012 when they only seized Goma in the fighting connected to ethnic tension, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power.",
      "Many Congolese soldiers were seen on Saturday fleeing the rebels\u2019 advance into Bukavu alongside thousands of civilians amid widespread looting and panic.",
      "Congo\u2019s President Felix Tshisekedi held a security meeting in the faraway capital of Kinshasa, where officials noted that Bukavu was \u201cbriefly\u201d invaded by M23 but remains under the control of the Congolese army and allies from local militia, the presidency said on X. There were no signs of fighting or of Congolese forces in most parts of Bukavu on Sunday.",
      "Tshisekedi has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict. Congo\u2019s forces are being supported in Bukavu by troops from Burundi and in Goma by troops from South Africa.",
      "Burundi\u2019s president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest his country will not retaliate in the fighting. In a post on X he said that \u201cthose people who were ready to get profit of the armed attack of Rwanda to Burundi will not see this.\u201d",
      "The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, said it was committed to \u201cdefending the people of Bukavu\u201d in a Saturday statement that did not acknowledge their presence in the city. \u201cWe call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,\u201d Lawrence Kanyuka, the alliance\u2019s spokesperson, said in a statement.",
      "The fighting in Congo\u00a0has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda says the group is \u201cfully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges."

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:55:41 GMT",
    "summary": "A competition to name twin panda cubs launched Saturday following a ceremony at the Hong Kong theme park that houses the twins and their parents.",
    "story": [
      "Panda craze has once again gripped Hong Kong as residents compete to name the territory\u2019s\u00a0first locally-born giant panda cubs\u00a0who just turned six months old.",
      "The competition to name the twin cubs, born Aug. 15, launched Saturday following a celebratory ceremony attended by Hong Kong leader John Lee and other officials at Ocean Park, the theme park that houses the twins, their parents and two other\u00a0giant pandas that arrived from mainland China\u00a0last year. Residents can submit their suggestions via the park\u2019s website.",
      "Lee said the southern Chinese city now has the largest number of pandas in captivity outside of mainland China, and the cubs\u2019 names would be announced in the first half of this year.",
      "The pair, currently identified as the \u201cElder Sister\u201d and the \u201cLittle Brother,\u201d will make their public debut on Sunday and meet visitors for five hours daily. Those who want to enjoy time with the cubs outside regular visiting hours, before the park opens, can pay 1,500 Hong Kong dollars (about $190).",
      "During a media preview session on Saturday, the male cub laid on a swing playing with a tree stick before a carer placed him on a slide. The female cub explored the enclosure before climbing onto a tree.",
      "The panda carers said the female cub seemed more active than her male twin. She loves climbing the tree inside the enclosure and resting there while her brother likes to wander around and play with the plants. The male cub has been marked with two purple food-coloring spots on its back to distinguish it from his sister.",
      "The birth of the baby pandas last year made their mother Ying Ying the world\u2019s oldest first-time panda mom.",
      "Their popularity on social media also raised hopes for the city\u2019s tourism boost. Officials have encouraged businesses to capitalize on the panda craze to seize opportunities in what some lawmakers have\u00a0dubbed the \u201cpanda economy.\u201d",
      "Ocean Park\u2019s chairman Paulo Pong told reporters on Saturday that the park already saw income increases over the Christmas period and Lunar New Year holiday, alongside an uptake in overseas tourists, after the newly arrived pandas from mainland China\u00a0started to greet the public.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re turning the page and we believe the pandas are definitely helping the income of the park,\u201d he said.",
      "But\u00a0caring for pandas in captivity is expensive. Ocean Park recorded a deficit of 71.6 million Hong Kong dollars ($9.2 million) last financial year, and in 2020 required a government relief fund to stay afloat. Observers are watching if taking care of six pandas will add to its burden or give it a chance to revive its business.",
      "Pong said raising pandas was about animal conservation and education, instead of \u201cjust a money exercise.\u201d",
      "Pandas are considered China\u2019s unofficial national mascot. The country\u2019s giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing\u2019s soft-power diplomacy."

      "The attack, which took place Thursday during a trade union demonstration, injured dozens of people between the ages of 2 to 60, with eight seriously hurt, police said earlier in the week.",
      "The suspect, who drove a white vehicle into the crowd of thousands of people, was arrested on 36 counts of attempted murder, as well as grievous bodily harm and reckless driving.",

He was known to authorities \u201cfrom investigations in which he was a witness due to his previous work\u201d as a store detective, Munich police have said. He did not have any prior convictions."

Doctors may detect pneumonia by listening for a crackling or whistling sound in the lungs while the patient breathes, but often other tests are needed including a chest X-ray and pulse oximetry that measures how much oxygen is in the blood.

    "story": [
      "HOHENFELS, Germany \u2014 As the morning fog lifted over rolling, wooded hills in Bavaria, southeast Germany, a drone swept down to the grassy clearing and two U.S. infantrymen ran out of a nearby forest to change two long, black batteries.",
      "Under the cover of trees nearby, another soldier was on a laptop monitoring the activity of that drone and several others, tracking an enemy vehicle several miles away.",
      "Developed and tested using information from the real-life battlefield in Ukraine, the drone was one of several pieces of technology including light vehicles and updated communication devices that were being tested for the first time by the U.S. Army in Europe.",
      "\u201cThese drones are definitely smarter than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d 1st Lt. Jake Baumert told NBC News earlier this month as his new unmanned systems platoon experimented with the new\u00a0equipment to figure out how best to use it in traditional infantry fighting.",
      "\u201cThey have missions and they are semiautonomous, not fully autonomous, but you plan it, and you can direct it if you want to,\u201d added the 28-year-old from Dallas.",
      "Deploying multiple drones including short-range quadcopters similar to those available in stores to the public, his platoon observed the opposing force\u2019s tactical vehicles. They also sent up larger unmanned aerial vehicles that flew semiautonomously.",
      "As well as being able to start and land them with a click of a button on their laptop, operators could also hand control of the drones to other units hidden in dense forest several miles away, while the information they gathered could be shared instantly with colleagues or commanders.",
      "\u201cI think the biggest advantage is the technology that\u2019s in the drone and its ability to give you data,\u201d Baumert said.",
      "Elsewhere, soldiers tested vehicles that seat more soldiers than traditional Humvees. Smaller and often more agile in steep terrain, they are easier to camouflage and are equipped with hybrid engines, making them quieter and less likely to be spotted by drones with thermal cameras.",
      "Lessons learned during Ukraine\u2019s three-year war with Russia and Israel\u2019s fight with Hamas in Gaza had \u201creally identified that we\u2019ve got to get faster at staying competitive,\u201d Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael Weimer said in an interview late last month.",
      "Experience garnered during Iran\u2019s missile and drone attacks on Israel, as well as those by its Houthi proxy army in Yemen was also being taken into account, he added.",
      "\u201cThe character of war is changing at a speed we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get faster at staying competitive with the technology that\u2019s changing.\u201d",
      "Information from the battlefield was coming via several avenues in Ukraine, he said.",
      "\u201cTraditionally, we wouldn\u2019t give such new technology to soldiers this early. Traditionally, we would grab a few soldiers, and we would allow them to use the gear, experiment with it, get some feedback from them, then go back, do some more research and development,\u201d added Weimer. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here, because so much of this is commercial off the shelf, is we\u2019re expediting our ability to learn.\u201d",
      "The lessons U.S. and NATO troops are learning from Ukraine and implementing in their training are game changers, according to Ed Arnold, a European security expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cUsing drones to spot targets is one of the most important things we have learned from Ukraine. As an example, using artillery strikes. There\u2019s nowhere to hide on the battlefield,\u201d he said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "He added that the maritime capabilities were \u201cprobably more significant than the land capabilities,\u201d because Ukraine\u2019s military had been able to use marine drones to destroy Russian ships and infrastructure. This had allowed Ukraine to keep vital shipping lanes open so it could continue exporting critical products like grain.",
      "The U.S. military had also learned a lot from the way Ukraine has defended parts of the Black Sea, he said.",
      "Back on the training ground in Hohenfels, Col. Josh Glonek, the commander of the 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, said incorporating the new technology had dramatically reduced the time it took to make a firing decision after spotting an enemy.",
      "This had gone from double digits to under two minutes, said the 43-year-old from Gordon, Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cThe lessons that are coming out of Ukraine are ones that we are very rapidly adapting to and incorporating into our own training,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s provided, I would say, a sense of urgency, not only for us, but for our NATO allies as well, to very rapidly modernize.\u201d",
