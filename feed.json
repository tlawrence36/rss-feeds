      "The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster",
      "LONDON -- The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning.",
      "The century-old, publicly funded BBC faced criticism after its flagship TV news program spliced together sections of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, so that it appeared he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "The BBC chairman apologized Monday for an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d A letter from Trump\u2019s attorney threatened legal action, demanding that the broadcaster \u201cretract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements\u201d and compensate the president for the harm caused.",
      "Critics say the episode is just the latest example of bias at the BBC, but supporters maintain that it is one of the most trusted sources of news in the U.K. and around the world, and that the departure of its most senior executives casts a chill on public-service broadcasting.",
      "\u201cThis is an existential crisis for the BBC,\u201d said Julie Posetti, a journalism professor at City St. George\u2019s University of London. \u201cIn capitulating so quickly, it has sent a signal that it\u2019s relatively easy to cow the BBC.\u201d",
      "That is \u201cincredibly dangerous\u201d in an increasingly polarized environment \u201cwhere the information ecosystem is incredibly polluted,\u201d she warned.",
      "A look at the scandal, past criticism of the BBC and uncertainty about its future:",
      "The furor unfolded days after the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper last week published details from an internal memo compiled by a former external editorial standards adviser to the BBC.",
      "The memo raised concerns over how the BBC\u2019s \u201cPanorama\u201d documentary program edited a speech by Trump.",
      "The program, which was broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. election, as Trump ran for a second term, spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "Among the parts that were cut was a segment where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.",
      "The BBC\u2019s director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned Sunday.",
      "The broadcaster\u2019s chair, Samir Shah, acknowledged that the editing gave \u201cthe impression of a direct call for violent action.\u201d Turness said Monday that mistakes were made, but she insisted \"there\u2019s no institutional bias\u201d at the BBC \u2014 a position supported by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "The memo also criticized BBC coverage of transgender issues, alleging that the broadcaster\u2019s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda, and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service.",
      "Reacting to the resignations Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a screen grab of an article headlined \u201cTrump goes to war with \u2018fake news\u2019 BBC.\u201d Trump himself wrote on social media that BBC journalists were \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201ctried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.\u201d",
      "Critics have long charged that the broadcaster leans left, though some have also accused it of being too cautious to challenge successive Conservative Party governments. On Monday, the hard-right leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage, told a news conference that the BBC \u201chas been institutionally biased for decades\u201d to loud applause from supporters.",

      "\u201cThis is the BBC\u2019s last chance,\u201d Farage said. \u201cIf the BBC doesn\u2019t now get a grip \u2026 then I think what you would see within the next couple of years are many, many millions just refusing, just not wanting to have the license fee.\u201d",

      "La Fenice opera house in Venice faces a dispute over the appointment of Beatrice Venezi as musical director",
      "VENICE, Italy -- The storied Venetian opera house La Fenice is embroiled in a dispute with its orchestra and chorus over the appointment of a young and telegenic musical director with ties to Premier Giorgia Meloni but none with the musicians she has been hired to conduct.",
      "La Fenice\u2019s general manager, Nicola Colabianchi, who joined the theater in March, has defended his choice of 35-year-old Beatrice Venezi, saying her youthful energy will bring a new audience to the theater where Giuseppe Verdi premiered \u2018\u2019Rigoletto\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019La Traviata\u2019\u2019 more than 170 years ago.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s young and dynamic, she\u2019s already written several books and she\u2019s conducted many orchestras. She\u2019s a person who attracts a great deal of media attention. So all of this will only bring attention to the theater and the theater\u2019s future,'' Colabianchi said in an interview. \u201dWe can\u2019t think the theater can survive with 80-year-old season ticket holders.\u2019\u2019",
      "In the six weeks since Venezi\u2019s appointment, effective next October, was announced by La Fenice on social media, striking workers forced the cancellation of an opera premiere and unions have called for Colabianchi\u2019s resignation.",
      "Another protest was planned for Monday, backed by other Italian opera houses in solidarity.",
      "Critics say Venezi doesn\u2019t have the requisite experience for a theater of La Fenice\u2019s profile, where famed conductors Arturo Toscanini, Claudio Abbado and Riccardo Muti have lifted their batons. They also suggest the choice was influenced by Venezi\u2019s ties to Meloni and her far-right Brothers of Italy.",
      "Venezi has not publicly commented on the La Fenice dispute, and canceled a public appearance to avoid polemics.",
      "She is the daughter of a prominent member of Forza Nuova, another hard-right party, and has identified with the right\u2019s conservative values. However, she told the daily La Stampa in 2023 that she was \u201coffended when they call me a little fascist.\u2019\u2019",
      "La Fenice\u2019s unions say they are not contesting Venezi\u2019s youth, gender or political leanings, but the lack of consultations with the musicians whom she must lead. They note that Colabianchi had pledged an open process just days before Venezi\u2019s appointment was announced.",

      "La Fenice\u2019s unions have asked Colabianchi to revoke Venezi\u2019s appointment, and relaunch the selection process, allowing the musicians time to work with and become familiar with any candidates, Venezi included. They also have demanded Colabianchi's resignation.",
      "Colabianchi, for his part, has apologized for hiring Venezi without more consultations, but he remains firm in his choice.",
      "\u2018\u2019I chose Beatrice Venezi because I had invited her, while I was the general manager in Caglieri, for three separate operas, and she was a huge success,'' Colabianchi said, adding she has a broad repertoire of more than 50 operas. \"She is young, and we need to promote the young; she is a woman, and we need to promote women.\u2019\u2019",
      "He said there was no question of his resigning and that he would bring Venezi to the theater as soon as the protests against her appointment cease. Her first appointment to conduct with the full orchestra would be in July, for a concert in St. Mark\u2019s Square, though others could be added earlier, Colabianchi said.",

      "Salman Rushdie is among those being honored at the Dayton Literary Peace Prize event in Ohio",
      "DAYTON, Ohio -- DAYTON, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Salman Rushdie was among the honorees Sunday at the Dayton Literary Peace Prize event in Ohio, receiving a lifetime achievement award after publishing his first work of fiction since being stabbed on a New York lecture stage three years ago.",
      "The prizes honor both literary merit and the writers' promotion of peace through their work, with separate awards annually for fiction, nonfiction and lifetime achievement. The Ohio city was the site of negotiations that led to the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995, ending a war in the Balkans marked by ethnic cleansing that killed more than 300,000 people, as well as the displacement of 1 million residents.",
      "The 78-year-old Rushdie is best known for his 1988 novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which includes a dream sequence about the Prophet Muhammad that prompted allegations of blasphemy and a 1989 call from Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for the Indian-born writer's death, driving him into hiding. He was blinded in one eye from the 2022 attack before a stunned audience, and his assailant \u2014 who wasn't born when \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d was published \u2014 was sentenced to 25 years in prison.",
      "In accepting his award, Rushdie said it can be difficult to write about peace while living in a time of \u201cinexcusable violence,\u201d including the conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan.",
      "\u201cA book cannot stop a bullet. A poem cannot intercept a bomb,\" he said.",
      "But through literature, he said, writers can express solidarity with those who are suffering and others on the front lines of conflict zones, such as journalists.",

      "Authorities said Rushdie's attacker, Hadi Matar, then 24 and a U.S. citizen, was attempting to carry out the decades-old edict calling for his death when he traveled from his home in Fairview, New Jersey, to target the writer at the summer retreat of Chautauqua, New York, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) southwest of Buffalo.",
      "Rushdie published an acclaimed memoir about the attack, \u201cKnife,\u201d in 2024, a finalist for the National Book Award for Nonfiction. His most recent work, his 23rd, is \u201cThe Eleventh Hour,\u201d which includes three novellas and two short stories.",
      "Other past recipients of the lifetime achievement award include former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, feminist movement icon Gloria Steinem and writers Margaret Atwood, John Irving, Barbara Kingsolver, and Studs Terkel. The lifetime achievement award, also known as the Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award, is named for the American diplomat who was an architect of the Dayton Peace Accords.",
      "Other honorees this year include Kaveh Akbar for his novel, \u201cMartyr!\" about a poet and son of Iranian immigrants dealing with a mysterious family past, and Sunil Amrith, for \u201cThe Burning Earth,\u201d a history of how the global environment has been shaped by empires, wars and humanity's increasing freedom of movement.",

      "On the heels of the worst box office weekend of 2025, \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d faced little competition from new titles. Not accounting for inflation, the $40 million opening marked a new high for the dreadlocked alien franchise, besting the $38.3 million launch of 2004\u2019s \u201cAlien vs. Predator.\u201d",
      "\u201cPredator: Badlands,\u201d written and directed by Dan Trachtenberg, collected another $40 million overseas for the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s 20th Century Studios.

      "\u201cBadlands,\u201d the eighth movie in the franchise that began with 1987\u2019s \u201cPredator,\u201d offers a novel twist for the sci-fi series. On a remote planet, a young, outcast predator (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) encounters an android researcher (Elle Fanning), and the two set off on a journey. Reviews (85% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) have been good. Moviegoers gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Good news had lately been hard to find in movie theaters. On Wednesday, AMC Theaters, the largest theater chain, posted a $298.2 million quarterly loss, partly due to a less-than-stellar summer season. But the fall has been worse. Last month was the lowest-grossing October in nearly three decades. Few awards hopefuls have made much of a mark.",
      "This weekend, a new wave hit theaters. But despite plenty of star power, most fell flat.",
      "\u201cDie My Love,\u201d starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, launched with $2.8 million from 1,983 theaters. The film, directed by Lynne Ramsay, stars Lawrence as a new mother and Pattinson as her husband.

      "\u201cChristy,\u201d starring Sydney Sweeney as the professional boxer Christy Martin, debuted with $1.3 million in 2,011 theaters. The film, the first one distributed by production company Black Bear Pictures, has earned Sweeney awards buzz since its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.",
      "Sony Pictures Classics\u2019 \u201cNuremberg,\u201d a post-World War II drama about the Nuremberg trials starring Rami Malek and Russell Crowe, managed to do a bit better. It opened with $4.1 million in 1,802 theaters.",
      "It was slightly edged by the best performer of the newcomers: \u201cSarah\u2019s Oil.\u201d The Amazon MGM release opened with $4.5 million from 2,410 locations. It stars Naya Desir-Johnson as a young Black girl in the early 1900s who learns that her Oklahoma land allotment is rich with oil. \u201cSarah\u2019s Oil\u201d scored a rare \u201cA+\u201d CinemaScore from ticket buyers.",

The family drama\u2019s cast includes Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, and, in her second movie of the weekend, Elle Fanning.

      "A clip of the BBC \u201cPanorama\u201d episode shared by The Daily Telegraph appears to show different parts of Trump\u2019s speech edited into one quote.

      "Thieves made away with eight objects on display at the Paris museum, including a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century Queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense.

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lea Michele was just a kid actor backstage at the Imperial Theatre on Broadway when she first heard a song from the musical \u201cChess\u201d on a stereo. Some three decades later, she finds herself singing that same tune in the same theater.",
      "The \u201cGlee\u201d and Broadway veteran, who got her professional start in \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d at age 8, has returned, now a mother and a bankable star, to her old stomping grounds, which coincidentally is the very theater where \u201cChess\u201d made its debut in 1988.",
      "\u201cThe Imperial Theatre really has a soul. Every show that\u2019s ever been in it is absorbed in the walls. It\u2019s a little eerie, but very powerful. Other theaters can feel a little sterile, but this does not feel that way,\u201d she says.",
      "She remembers exactly where she sat the first time she saw \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d \u2014 orchestra left, six rows in \u2014 hearing Paige O\u2019Hara as Fantine sing \u201cI Dreamed a Dream\u201d in the musical that she would soon join, playing Young Cosette and Young Eponine.",
      "\u201cI was in the show and I told my parents, I said \u2018I love this. I want to do this for the rest of my life.\u2019 And it\u2019s really very emotional to be here 30 years later still working, thank God, back at this theater,\u201d she says. The icing on the cake? An electrician on her return simply said: \u201cWelcome home.\u201d",
      "\u201cChess,\u201d which opens Nov. 16 and is set primarily in Bangkok and Budapest during the Cold War, tells the fictional story about two chess grandmasters \u2014 an American played by Aaron Tveit and a Soviet, portrayed by Nicholas Christopher \u2014 facing off to win for their respective nations, a task complicated by the appearance of a woman they both love, played by Michele.",
      "\u201cThis is the hardest character in a lot of ways that I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d Michele says. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman. She\u2019s strong. I don\u2019t have comedy to lean on as a crutch or as a kind of like a protective cloak.\u201d",
      "The show reunites Michele with Tony Award-winning director Michael Mayer, who directed her both in her breakout \u201c Spring Awakening \u201d in 2006 and also in \u201cFunny Girl\u201d in 2022.",
      "Mayer also has great memories of the Imperial Theatre. It was the place where he saw his first Broadway show \u2014 \u201cPippin\u201d in 1976 with Ben Vereen. He was in the back row of the mezzanine, eight seats in from the right aisle. \u201cI sat there and everything came back,\u201d he says.",
      "The show, with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA, originated as a concept album in 1984 and includes the goosebump-raising \u201cAnthem,\u201d the pop-pulsing \u201cOne Night in Bangkok\u201d\u2014 which reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 and the lilting \u201cI Know Him So Well.\u201d",
      "The musical, first staged in London in 1986 and heavily revised for a Broadway production in 1988, has a cult fan base, but the Broadway production was a flop, lasting less than 90 performances. Attempts have been made to resuscitate it over the years with concerts and new stagings. A new story has been written for the latest iteration by screenwriter Danny Strong.",

    "story": [
      "The theft of the Louvre's crown jewels has increased calls for the museum to be more transparent about the colonial origins of the treasures it displays",
      "PARIS -- As French police race to track where the Louvre's stolen crown jewels have gone, a growing chorus wants a brighter light on where they came from.",
      "The artifacts were French, but the gems were not. Their exotic routes to Paris run through the shadows of empire \u2014 an uncomfortable history that France, like other Western nations with treasure-filled museums, has only begun to confront.",
      "The attention sparked by the heist is an opportunity, experts say, to pressure the Louvre and Europe\u2019s great museums to explain their collections' origins more honestly, and it could trigger a broader reckoning over restitutions.",
      "Within hours of the theft, researchers sketched a likely colonial-era map for the materials: sapphires from Ceylon (Sri Lanka), diamonds from India and Brazil, pearls from the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean and emeralds from Colombia.",
      "That doesn\u2019t make the Louvre robbery less criminal. It does complicate the public's understanding of what was lost.",
      "\u201cThere is obviously no excuse for theft,\u201d said Emiline C.H. Smith, a criminologist at the University of Glasgow who studies heritage crime. \u201cBut many of these objects are entangled with violent, exploitative, colonial histories.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s no credible evidence these specific gems were stolen \u2014 experts say that doesn\u2019t end the argument: What was legal in the imperial age could still mean plunder in today\u2019s lights. In other words, the paperwork of empire doesn\u2019t settle the ethics.",
      "Meanwhile, the heist investigation grinds on. Police have charged suspects, but investigators fear the jewels could be broken up or melted down. They are too symbolic to fence, but easy to monetize for metal and stones.",
      "The Louvre provides scant information about how the gems in the French crown jewels \u2013 showcased in the Apollo Gallery until the theft \u2014 were originally extracted.",
      "For example, the Louvre\u2019s own catalog describes the stolen diadem of Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie as set with \u201cCeylon sapphires\u201d in their natural, unheated state, bordered with diamonds in gold. It says nothing about who mined them, how they moved, or under what terms they were taken.",
      "Provenance isn\u2019t always a neutral ledger in Western museums. They sometimes \u201cavoid spotlighting uncomfortable acquisition histories,\u201d Smith said, adding that the lack of clarity about the gems\u2019 origins is likely no accident.",
      "The museum did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The stolen tiaras, necklaces and brooches were crafted in Paris by elite ateliers, and once belonged to 19th-century figures such as Marie-Am\u00e9lie, Queen Hortense, and the wives of two Napoleons, Empress Marie-Louise of Austria and Empress Eug\u00e9nie. Their raw materials, however, moved through imperial networks that converted global labor, resources \u2014 and even slavery \u2014 into European prestige, experts say.",
      "Pascal Blanchard, a historian of France\u2019s colonial past, draws a line between craftsmanship and supply. The jewels \u201cwere made in France by French artisans,\u201d he said, but many stones came via colonial circuits and were \u201cproducts of colonial production.\u201d They were traded \u201cunder the legal conditions \u2026 of the time,\u201d ones shaped by empires that siphoned wealth from Africa, Asia and South America.",
      "Some French critics press the point further. They argue that national outcry over loss should sit beside the history of how imperial France acquired the stones that court jewelers later set in gold.",
      "India is waging the best-known battle over a single colonial-era treasure \u2014 the Koh-i-Noor diamond.",

      "India has repeatedly pressed the U.K. to return the mythologized 106-carat jewel, now set in the Queen Mother\u2019s crown at the Tower of London. It likely originated in India's Golconda diamond belt \u2014 much like the Louvre's dazzling Regent diamond, one that was also legally acquired in imperial times and spared by the Oct. 19 robbers.",
      "The Koh-i-Noor passed from court to court before landing in British hands, where it is hailed in London as a \u201clawful\u201d imperial gift and denounced in India as a prize taken under the shadow of conquest. A 2017 petition to India\u2019s Supreme Court seeking its return was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, but the political and moral dispute endures.",
      "France is not Britain, and the Koh-i-Noor is not the Louvre's story. But it frames the questions increasingly applied to 19th-century acquisitions: not only \u201cwas it bought?\u201d but \u201cwho had the power to sell?\u201d On that measure, experts say, even jewels made in France can be considered products of colonial extraction.",
      "The Louvre case lands in a world already primed by other fights. Greece presses Britain to reunite the Parthenon Marbles. Egypt campaigns for the Rosetta Stone in London and the Nefertiti bust in Berlin.",
      "France has moved \u2014 narrowly. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pledge to return parts of Africa\u2019s heritage produced a law enabling the return of 26 royal treasures to Benin and items to Senegal. Madagascar recovered the crown of Queen Ranavalona III through a specific process.",
      "Critics say restitution is structurally blocked: French law forbids removing state-held objects unless Parliament makes a special exception, and risk-averse museums keep the rest behind glass.",
      "They also say that under former Louvre chief Jean-Luc Martinez, the museum's narrow definition of what counts as \u201clooted\u201d \u2014 and its demand for near-legal levels of proof \u2014 created a chilling effect on restitution claims, even as the museum publicly praised transparency. (The Louvre says it follows the law and academic standards.)",
      "Asking museum visitors to marvel at artifacts like the French crown jewels without understanding their social history is dishonest, says Erin L. Thompson, an art-crime scholar in New York. A decolonized approach, she and others argue, would name where such stones came from, how the trade worked, who profited and who paid \u2014 and share authorship with origin communities.",
      "Egyptian archaeologist Monica Hanna calls the contradiction glaring.",
      "\u201cYes, the irony is profound,\u201d she said of the outcry over last month's Louvre theft, \u201cand it\u2019s central to the conversation about restitution.\u201d She expects the heist will trigger action on restitutions across Western museums and fuel debate about transparency.",
      "At a minimum, Hanna and other experts say, what's needed from museums are stronger words: plain-spoken labels and wall texts that acknowledge where objects came from, how they moved, and at whose expense. It would mean publishing what is known, admitting what isn\u2019t, and inviting contested histories into the gallery \u2014 even when they cloud the shine.",
      "Some offer a practical path.",
      "\u201cTell the honest and complete story,\u201d said Dutch restitution specialist Jos van Beurden. \u201cOpen the windows, not for thieves, but for fresh air.\u201d",

      "A host of talent is on deck to announce the nominees, including Gayle King, Doechii, Karol G, Lizzo, Mumford & Sons, Nicole Scherzinger, Sabrina Carpenter, Sam Smith, Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, Brandi Carlile, CeCe Winans, David Foster, Jon Batiste, Little Big Town, Masaki Koike and last year's best new artist winner, Chappell Roan.",
      "Only recordings commercially released in the U.S. between Aug. 31, 2024 through Aug. 30, 2025 are eligible for nominations, so don\u2019t expect to see Taylor Swift's \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d included. But do expect to see Carpenter's \u201cMan's Best Friend\u201d among the nominees; it was released just under the wire on August 29.",
      "That might have a little something to do with the new addition of a stand-alone category for best album cover. Carpenter sparked considerable discourse when its artwork was revealed; it shows the pop star kneeling on the ground in a dog-like pose while an unseen person pulls her by the hair.",
      "There are plenty of unknowns going into the nomination announcements, too. The most obvious contenders for album of the year did not release new full-lengths within the eligibility window \u2014 artists like Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Adele. But there have been a few heavy hitters, like Kendrick Lamar's \u201cGNX,\" Lady Gaga's \u201cMayhem\u201d and Bad Bunny's \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\u201d If any of them took home the top prize, it would be for the first time.",

      "The report is the 20th edition of the annual tracking by GLAAD and charts a remarkable leap from just 47 LGBTQ+ characters in the first study.

      "France's court of auditors has urged the Louvre museum to prioritize security modernization",
      "PARIS -- France's court of auditors urged the Louvre museum to speed up its security modernization plans as a priority, in a report conducted before the Oct. 19 jewels heist that noted major delays in the renovation of the world\u2019s most-visited museum.",
      "Thursday\u2019s report by the Cour des Comptes comes after a series of failings and security issues came to light following the robbery of the $102-million worth Crown Jewels that shocked the world. The thieves used a truck-mounted basket lift to reach a window of the Apollo Gallery and fled with the trove within minutes.",
      "\u201cThe theft of the crown jewels is undoubtedly a deafening alarm bell,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, head of the court of auditors, said at a news conference.",
      "The report, focusing on the 2018-2024 period, said the museum's investments prioritized \u201cvisible and attractive operations\u201d like buying new pieces of art and improving visitor experience. That was \u201cat the expense of the maintenance and renovation of buildings and technical installations, particularly safety and security systems,\u201d it said.",
      "A plan to modernize security equipment was being studied since 2018 but its implementation kept being delayed, the report said. Actual technical work was only to start next year and was planned to be fully implemented by 2032.",
      "\"The pace is far too slow,\" Moscovici said.",
      "The court of auditors believes security can be improved without hiring more staff at the museum, Moscovici added. A previous assessment shows that the Oct. 19 heist was made possible by outdated security systems, not because of lack of staff, he said.",
      "The cost for security modernization is estimated to 83 million euros ($95 million), out of which only 3 million euros ($3.5 million) have been invested between 2018 and 2024, according to the report.",
      "The museum said that over the past three years, 134 digital cameras have been installed to supplement or replace outdated cameras throughout the museum, the report noted.",

      "The court of auditors, which is an independent body, recommended that the Louvre focuses on priorities including bringing the museum\u2019s technical facilities, particularly safety and security, up to standards, and cut its expenses in other areas. That means reducing art acquisition and saving on museum rooms' renovation projects, the report said.",
      "In response to the audit, the Louvre on Thursday said it \u201cregretted\u201d that the report did not take into account the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the 2024 Paris Olympics, which the museum said impacted certain decisions.",
      "The Louvre said it agrees with most of the court of auditors\u2019 recommendations and already made similar proposals. It noted that the Oct. 19 theft occurred weeks before planned security improvements were to start being implemented.",
      "The decade-long \u201cLouvre New Renaissance\u201d plan, which includes security improvements, was launched earlier this year. It is estimated it would cost up to 800 million euros ($933 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the famed Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "Last week, Culture Minister Rachida Dati said the Louvre will install streetside anti-ramming and anti-intrusion devices in the next two months, following a provisional investigation that found a \u201cchronic, structural underestimation\u201d of the risk of theft at the Paris landmark.",
      "Dati acknowledged \u201csecurity gaps,\u201d refused the resignation of the museum director and cited four failings: underestimated risk, underequipped security, ill-suited governance and \u201cobsolete\u201d protocols.",
      "Four suspects in the Louvre heist were arrested last week, including three believed to be members of the team of four that was filmed using a basket lift to reach the museum\u2019s window. They face preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. The jewels have not been recovered, authorities said.",

      "ByHeart officials expanded the voluntary recall from two lots announced Saturday to all products in consumers' homes and in stores. That includes ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula and Anywhere Pack pouches of powdered formula. The company sells about 200,000 cans of infant formula a month online and in stores such as Target, Walmart, Albertsons and Whole Foods, according to Dr. Devon Kuehn, chief medical officer.",

      "Canada is no longer measles-free because of ongoing outbreaks, international health experts said Monday, as childhood vaccination rates fall and the highly contagious virus spreads across North and South America.",
      "The loss of the country\u2019s measles elimination status comes more than a year after the highly contagious virus started spreading.",
      "Canada has logged 5,138 measles cases this year and two deaths. Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.",
      "Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.",
      "Measles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it\u2019s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World Health Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.",
      "It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.",
      "\u201cIt's a deeply disheartening development. It's a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it's an embarrassing development,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. \u201cNo country with the amount of resources of Canada \u2014 or other countries in North America even \u2014 should lose their measles elimination status.\u201d",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.",
      "But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada\u2019s loss.",
      "Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada\u2019s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.",
      "It has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cAs a region, we have eliminated measles twice,\u201d Barbosa said. \u201cWe can do it a third time.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance.",
      "The virus is one of the most contagious known to medicine. One infected person can spread it to up to 9 out of 10 unprotected people they come into close contact with. Health experts say, by far, the best prevention against measles is the vaccine, which provides 97% protection after two doses.",
      "Barbosa's organization has confirmed nearly 12,600 cases this year across 10 countries, a 30-fold increase from 2024. The vast majority are in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, but Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have active outbreaks.",

      "Some states acted quickly to direct their EBT vendors to disburse full monthly benefits to SNAP recipients.

Scientists say it then takes some \u201cenvironmental\u201d trigger, such as an infection, smoking or pollutants, to set the disease into motion. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus is linked to MS.",
      "Scientists are zeroing in on the earliest molecular triggers. For example, white blood cells called neutrophils are first responders to signs of infection or injury \u2014 but abnormally overactive ones are suspected of playing a key role in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases.",

      "But men do suffer from autoimmune diseases. One especially severe one named VEXAS syndrome wasn\u2019t discovered until 2020. It mainly affects men over 50 and in addition to typical autoimmune symptoms it can cause blood clots, shortness of breath and night sweats.",

      "The list goes on: A new count from the National Institutes of Health tallied 140 autoimmune conditions, many rare but altogether a leading cause of chronic disease that\u2019s often invisible.",

      "What that looks like now: One evening last February, Wilson bubbled with nerves and excitement at finally meeting some members of her online lupus support group. At UMass Chan Medical School, Wilson greeted the two women and two men with hugs. They shared symptoms and treatments \u2014 and rueful stories of well-meaning relatives urging them to just get more sleep to combat the lupus fatigue that rest can't conquer.",
      "A month later, Wilson traveled to Washington for a meeting organized by the Lupus Research Alliance, where she urged scientists and drug company researchers to heed patient reports of changes in their everyday lives, such as whether a new therapy helps brain fog.",

      "Wearing bright orange vests, the humans ring bells, blow whistles and strike rocks and trees with walking sticks as they weave through bamboo and brush. Using GPS trackers, they follow the monkeys' movements and radio teammates to close in when nearby. The aim is to herd the animals back into the mountains and away from farms and homes.",

      "Enter the Monkey Chasing Squad, about 50 paid, part-time civil servants who try to control the monkeys.",
      "Before 2023, nearly all the monkeys in Ariake, a district of Azumino city, lived within the town, with only 1% in the mountains, said Masaya Miyake, who moved to Azumino five years ago and now leads the squad. According to the city, the macaques spend about half their time in the hills and the remainder in the villages, an improvement both Miyake and the city attribute to the group\u2019s efforts.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just returning them to where they\u2019re supposed to be,\u201d said Miyake. \u201cNaturally, the food in the village is more nutritious and tastier. They're not simply being mischievous; they\u2019re just coming down to eat.\u201d",

      "\u201cI want to share with as many people as possible the peaceful behavior of monkeys in their natural habitat,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "One winter morning deep in the mountains, Matsuda encountered a hunter authorized to cull monkeys, which Azumino estimates at a population of about 600 in the city. Capturing monkeys is done by hunting organizations with the government's permission.",
      "\u201cWhen I asked why he killed that specific monkey, he told me it was simply because he had seen it,\" Matsuda said.",
      "\"He hadn't considered whether the monkey was from a group that encroached on human settlements and actually destroyed fields or attacked humans at random, or one that stayed deep in the forest.\"",
      "That made Matsuda question the city's approach. \u201cIn Japan today, opinions have become polarized between \u2018don\u2019t kill a single one\u2019 and \u2018kill them all,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI oppose the wasteful taking of life and want effective measures so we don\u2019t have to keep killing monkeys forever.\"",

Macaques live about 20 years, so we need to take a long-term approach.\u201d",
      "Michael Johnson, a retired English professor who has lived in Azumino since 2011, said that monkeys have broken into his house four times. A 2021 raid by 12 monkeys resulted in a five-hour cleanup after they feasted on eggs, bread, grains, fruit and almost everything else in sight.",

      "Drone warfare exploded following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022",
      "AALBORG, Denmark -- In a warehouse more than 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) from Ukraine's capital, workers in northern Denmark painstakingly piece together anti-drone devices. Some of the devices will be exported to Kyiv in the hopes of jamming Russian technology on the battlefield, while others will be shipped across Europe in efforts to combat mysterious drone intrusions into NATO's airspace that have the entire continent on edge.",
      "Two Danish companies whose business was predominantly defense-related now say they have a surge in new clients seeking to use their technology to protect sites like airports, military installations and critical infrastructure, all of which have been targeted by drone flyovers in recent weeks.",
      "Weibel Scientific\u2019s radar drone detection technology was deployed ahead of a key EU summit earlier this year to Copenhagen Airport, where unidentified drone sightings closed the airspace for hours in September. Counter-drone firm MyDefence, from its warehouse in northern Denmark, builds handheld, wearable radio frequency devices that sever the connection between a drone and its pilot to neutralize the threat.",
      "So-called \u201cjamming\u201d is restricted and heavily regulated in the European Union, but widespread on the battlefields of Ukraine and has become so extensive there that Russia and Ukraine have started deploying drones tethered by thin fiber-optic cables that don\u2019t rely on radio frequency signals. Russia also is firing attack drones with extra antenna to foil Ukraine\u2019s jamming efforts.",
      "Drone warfare exploded following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia has bombarded Ukraine with drone and missile attacks, striking railways, power facilities and cities across the country. Ukraine, in response, has launched daring strikes deep inside Russia using domestically produced drones.",
      "But Europe as a whole is now on high alert after the drone flyovers into NATO\u2019s airspace reached an unprecedented scale in September, prompting European leaders to agree to develop a \u201cdrone wall\u201d along their borders to better detect, track and intercept drones violating Europe\u2019s airspace. In November, NATO military officials said a new U.S. anti-drone system was deployed to the alliance\u2019s eastern flank.",
      "Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing NATO\u2019s response, which raised questions about how prepared the alliance is against Russia. Key challenges include the ability to detect drones \u2014 sometimes mistaken for a bird or plane on radar systems \u2014 and take them down cheaply.",
      "The Kremlin has brushed off allegations that Russia is behind some of the unidentified drone flights in Europe.",
      "Andreas Graae, assistant professor at the Royal Danish Defense College, said there is a \u201chuge drive\u201d to rapidly deploy counter-drone systems in Europe amid Russia's aggression.",
      "\u201cAll countries in Europe are struggling to find the right solutions to be prepared for these new drone challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have all the things that are needed to actually be good enough to detect drones and have early warning systems.\u201d",

      "\u201cFor the past couple of years, we\u2019ve heard in Ukraine that they want to put machines before people\u201d to save lives, Hermansen said.",

MyDefence went from the vast majority of its business being defense-related to inquiries from officials representing police forces and critical infrastructure.",

The American Merops system, which is small enough to fit in the back of a midsize pickup truck, can identify drones and close in on them using artificial intelligence to navigate when satellite and electronic communications are jammed.",

      "North of Copenhagen, Weibel Scientific has been making Doppler radar technology since the 1970s. Typically used in tracking radar systems for the aerospace industry, it\u2019s now being applied to drone detection like at Copenhagen Airport.",
      "The technology can determine the velocity of an object, such as a drone, based on the change in wavelength of a signal being bounced back. Then it's possible to predict the direction the object is moving, Weibel Scientific chief executive Peter R\u00f8pke said.",

      "The report by the International Energy Agency said renewable energy, led by solar power, will grow faster than any other major source in the next few years and that coal and oil demand will likely peak globally by the end of this decade. The report noted that many natural gas projects were approved in 2025, due to changes in U.S. policy, indicating worldwide supply will rise even as questions remain about how it will be used. Meanwhile, global nuclear power capacity is set to increase by at least a third by 2035 after being stagnant for years.",

      "\u201cIn a break from the trend of the past decade, the increase in electricity consumption is no longer limited to emerging and developing economies,\u201d IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a release. Birol said that electricity use is also rising in advanced economies.",
      "Nations are grappling with meeting demand while preparing for the risks brought on by the planet\u2019s warming. The IEA says the world is falling short on universal energy access and climate change goals. Around 730 million people still live without electricity, according to the IEA, and despite progress, nearly one-quarter of the global population still relies on inefficient cooking methods that hurt their health or the environment. 2024 was also the hottest year on record.",
      "Nations should diversify their energy sources and cooperate to expand supply chains for critical minerals, the IEA said. This also includes making quick improvements to the grid, energy storage and broader infrastructure.",
      "\u201cWhen we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once,\u201d Birol said. \u201cWith energy security front and (center) for many governments, their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that can arise with other policy goals \u2013 on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change.\u201d",
      "Wednesday's edition of the yearly report is the first released since the start of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.

      "Etharin Cousin, a former director of the United Nations World Food Program and founder of the nonprofit Food Systems for the Future, said the cutoff of SNAP benefits had immediate impacts on grocers and convenience stores of all sizes, most of which operate on slim profit margins of 1% to 2%.",
      "\u201cSNAP isn\u2019t just a social safety net for families. It\u2019s also a local economic engine,\u201d Cousin said. \u201cSNAP benefits flow directly into neighborhoods, stores, regional distributors and community jobs.\u201d",

      "Air travelers could face more frustration as busy U.S. airports need to meet a higher Federal Aviation Administration target for reducing flights Tuesday after already canceling thousands to scale back demands on the nation\u2019s aviation system during the government shutdown.",
      "The FAA ordered domestic airlines last week to drop 4% of their flights at 40 major U.S. airports, saying absences and signs of stress among traffic controllers made it imperative to act in the name of public safety. After already canceling more than 7,900 since Friday, the goal for cutting flights is set to rise to 6% on Tuesday and again to 10% on Friday.",
      "But it was unclear exactly how many additional flights would need to be canceled Tuesday. The average cancellation rate over the last few days already exceeded the FAA\u2019s requirement, according to aviation analytics company Cirium. The FAA also expanded its flight restrictions Monday, barring business jets and many private flights from using a dozen airports already under commercial flight limits.",
      "However, controller shortages continued to lead to flight delays, including one of about five hours for arriving flights Monday evening at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport, where wintry weather added to staffing-related disruptions earlier in the day. The FAA warned that staffing at over a dozen towers and control centers could delay planes departing for Phoenix, San Diego, the New York area and Houston, among other cities.",

      "That's typical, analysts say, of the trend for the extended discount campaign that is China's equivalent to Black Friday sales, initiated by China\u2019s Alibaba in 2009 as a 1-day event on Nov. 11 -- Double 11 in Chinese parlance, and considered a symbol of unattached singles.",

      "It remains to be seen if the appetite for spending may finally be recovering after the pandemic and a prolonged downturn in the property market.",

      "Economists and analysts say spending on big ticket items remains downbeat as value-minded shoppers focus on necessities and more affordable goods.",
      "\u201cConfidence remains quite downbeat among households,\u201d said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank.",

      "\u201cA lot of people have been complaining that the discounts (this year) are not very strong,\u201d said Yaling Jiang, an independent Chinese consumer analyst, adding that she observed a stronger sense of \u201cconsumer fatigue.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history appears to be nearing an end, but not without leaving a mark on an already-struggling economy.",
      "About 1.25 million federal workers haven't been paid since Oct. 1. Thousands of flights have been canceled, a trend that is expected to continue this week even as Congress moves toward reopening the government. Government contract awards have slowed and some food aid recipients have seen their benefits interrupted.",
      "Most of the lost economic activity will be recovered when the government reopens, as federal workers will receive back pay. But some canceled flights won't be retaken, missed restaurant meals won't be made up, and some postponed purchases will end up not happening at all.",
      "\u201cShort-lived shutdowns are usually invisible in the data, but this one will leave a lasting mark,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at accounting giant EY said, \"both because of its record length and the growing disruptions to welfare programs and travel.\u201d",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a six-week shutdown will reduce growth in this year's fourth quarter by about 1.5 percentage points. That would cut growth by half from the third quarter. The reopening should boost first-quarter growth next year by 2.2 percentage points, the CBO projected, but about $11 billion in economic activity will be permanently lost.",
      "The previous longest government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days but only partially shut the government because many agencies had been fully funded. It only nicked the economy by about 0.02% of GDP, the CBO said then.",
      "The current shutdown is adding to the economy's existing challenges, which include sluggish hiring, stubbornly elevated inflation, and President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have caused uncertainty for many businesses. Still, few economists foresee a recession.",
      "About 650,000 federal workers didn't work during the shutdown, which will likely boost the unemployment rate by about 0.4 percentage points in October, or to 4.7% from 4.3% in August, when the last report was released. Those workers would all then be counted as employed once the government reopens.",
      "Here are the ways the government closure is weighing on the economy:",
      "All told, federal workers will have missed about $16 billion in wages by mid-November, the CBO estimates. That has meant less spending at stores, restaurants, and likely reduced holiday travel. Large purchases will probably be postponed, slowing the broader economy.",
      "Trump had threatened during the shutdown to not provide back pay but the deal struck in Congress would replace those lost wages once the government reopens.",
      "The shutdown has added to the Washington, D.C. area's economic woes, where the unemployment rate was already 6% before the shutdown, after Trump's cuts to the federal workforce this spring caused job losses. While the Washington, D.C. area \u2014 including the nearby suburbs in Virginia and Maryland \u2014 has the highest concentration of federal workers, most live and work outside of the nation's capital.",
      "Federal workers make up about 5.5% of Maryland's workforce, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. But they also comprise 2.9% of New Mexico's workers, 2.6% of Oklahoma's, and 3.8% of Alaska's.",
      "Then there are the federal contractors. Bernard Yaros, an economist at Oxford Economics, estimates they could total as many as 5.2 million, and they are not guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends.",
      "Airlines scrapped more than 2,000 flights by Monday evening after canceling 5,500 since Friday on orders from the Federal Aviation Administration, which is seeking to reduce the burden on overworked air traffic controllers, who have now missed two paychecks.",
      "Even before the flight cancellations, Tourism Economics, an economic consulting firm, estimated that the shutdown would reduce travel spending by $63 million a day, which means a six-week standoff would cost the travel industry $2.6 billion.",

      "\u201cThe federal award spigot has all but turned off at the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d Yaros wrote.",
      "The shutdown delayed the payment of $8 billion in monthly SNAP food aid to 42 million recipients in November, creating a significant financial disruption for many households that likely reduced spending. Some states have managed to pay full benefits for this month, though the Trump administration is still fighting over the issue in court.",
      "The deal currently under consideration in Congress to reopen the government includes full funding of SNAP benefits.",
      "The government shutdown cut off the flow of economic data on unemployment, inflation, and retail spending that the Federal Reserve depends on to monitor the economy's health. Even as the government reopens, some of that data will still be delayed. As a result, the Fed may not deliver a third interest rate cut at its December meeting, which was widely expected before the shutdown.",
      "\u201cWhat do you do if you're driving in the fog? You slow down,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference late last month.",
      "Powell said the Fed's interest-rate setting committee is deeply divided over whether to reduce its key rate, partly because the economy's health is unusually cloudy right now. The government has missed two monthly jobs reports and the October inflation data, scheduled to be published Thursday, will likely never be issued.",
      "Powell said a rate cut in December was not a \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d and added that the lack of data could contribute to a decision by the Fed to skip a rate cut at its next meeting December 9-10. Fewer rate cuts could discourage borrowing and spending and weigh on the economy in the coming months.",

      "Laura and JR are two 25-year-olds newly employed at the same company, in the same role.",
      "On her first day at work, Laura committed 10% of her $75,000 salary to her 401(k). That earned her company\u2019s 3% annual match (it matches 50% up to 6%), and 13% in total savings. She still had room in her budget for weekends filled with activities.",
      "JR was more worried about now. Rather than putting money into a 401(k) he wouldn\u2019t touch for decades, he enjoyed his $75,000 salary. Five years later, JR began to build his nest egg. He opted for the minimum contribution rate to qualify for the company match, contributing 6% with a 3% match.",
      "Laura and JR\u2019s employer offered many investment vehicles, including target-date funds. One invested only in public stocks and bonds; the other kept a 15% allocation to private equity and private credit across the glide path.",
      "Laura preferred the public-only target-date fund for its simplicity and transparency. JR was also drawn to the target-date options and their ease of use. However, he went with the private market option since it promised higher returns, and to make up for his late start. He figured he could quickly recover five years of missed contributions, given that he had 35 years until retirement.",
      "Laura and JR both rose steadily to senior management positions. Their career progression, and their salaries, stayed in tandem. By the time they were turning 65 and approaching retirement, each was earning $178,620 a year. There had been no changes to their 401(k) contribution rates or their company\u2019s matching formula. As Laura and JR prepared to retire, they reviewed their 401(k)s.",
      "For JR, the target-date fund with private markets had paid off. Over 35 years of investing, the fund delivered an annualized return of 8.9%, compared with 8.4% for the public-only option. This left him with a balance of about $2 million. Combined with Social Security, JR felt that he could enjoy retirement without the risk of outliving his savings.",
      "The public-only TDF underperformed compared with the private markets TDF, but Laura didn\u2019t mind. Over 40 years of investing, her 401(k) account balance grew to more than $3 million. By starting earlier and contributing more she harnessed the power of compounding returns to a much greater extent than JR had.",
      "JR\u2019s private markets sleeve gave him a small edge, but Laura\u2019s decision to start saving earlier and save more made the real difference. Compounding did the rest, turning her steady contributions into a balance far larger than JR\u2019s.",

      "In illustrating the importance of saving early and saving more, we had to make several assumptions. We assumed that Laura and JR earn the same salary and stay at the same employer for their entire careers, with no breaks in employment. We assumed stocks, bonds, and private markets all delivered the long-term return expectations set by Morningstar Investment Management. It\u2019s not a given that a target-date fund with a 15% allocation to private markets would outperform a similar strategy focused solely on public stocks and bonds, especially after fees.",
      "There is debate about whether private equity funds outperform their public counterparts. A Morningstar analysis concluded that private equity funds are best thought of as another form of active management, where a handful of funds may significantly outperform their peers, but median returns are similar (or worse) to public market funds.",
      "Moreover, private markets present additional challenges for forecasting due to the heterogeneity in the underlying investments. The results should be viewed as more of a best-case scenario for target-date funds with private market exposure.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Billionaire Warren Buffett warned shareholders Monday that many companies will fare better than his Berkshire Hathaway in the decades ahead because of its massive size though others might say the company's prospects will dim because \u201cFather Time\u201d is catching up with the 95-year-old icon who plans to step down as CEO in January.",
      "Buffett reflected on life and his health in a new letter to shareholders where he announced $1.3 billion in new charitable gifts to the four family foundations run by his children that \u2014 along with the Gates Foundation \u2014 have been helping steadily give away his fortune since 2006.",
      "Berkshire is known for consistently outperforming the stock market during the past 60 years under Buffett \u2014 which helped earn him legions of fans \u2014 although that has become harder to do in recent years because of the huge size of the conglomerate. Berkshire owns Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several large utilities and a diverse assortment of manufacturing and retail businesses, including such well known brands as Dairy Queen, See's Candy and Helzberg Diamonds. But Buffett also reassured shareholders that he remains confident in his successor.",
      "Buffett promised to keep in touch with shareholders through Thanksgiving letters in the future, but he confirmed that next year Greg Abel will take over Buffett's famous yearly letter and answer all the questions at the annual meeting after he becomes CEO in January. Buffett will remain chairman.",
      "Buffett said that \u201cthrough dumb luck, I drew a ridiculously long straw at birth\u201d by being born in Omaha, Nebraska, where he met many lifelong friends \u2014 including several who helped shape Berkshire's fortune \u2014 and both his wives after attending public schools. He said he has been fortunate to have his life saved three times by doctors who lived nearby while managing to avoid the kind of calamities that often cut life short.",
      "Buffett recounted spending several weeks in the hospital after having his appendix out as a child where he turned to fingerprinting all the nuns who were taking care of him just in case they turned to a life of crime later. Buffett previously battled prostate cancer in 2012, but that wasn't considered life threatening.",

I can\u2019t think of a CEO, a management consultant, an academic, a member of government \u2013 you name it \u2013 that I would select over Greg to handle your savings and mine,\u201d Buffett wrote.",

      "\u201cIn aggregate, Berkshire\u2019s businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems. However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll,\u201d Buffett said.",

      "LONDON -- The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning.",

Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman and Nevada Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen also voted yes. All other Democrats, including Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, voted against it.",

      "It\u2019s unclear whether the two parties would be able to find any common ground on the health care subsidies before a promised December vote in the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he will not commit to bringing it up in his chamber.",
      "On Monday, Johnson said House Republicans have always been open to voting to reform what he called the \u201cunaffordable care act\u201d but again did not say if they would vote on the subsidies.",
      "Some Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19-era tax credits as premiums could skyrocket for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies. Some argue that the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals.",
      "Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins said Monday that she's supportive of extending the tax credits with changes, like new income caps. Some Democrats have signaled they could be open to that idea.",
      "\u201cWe do need to act by the end of the year, and that is exactly what the majority leader has promised,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Other Republicans, including Trump, have used the debate to renew their yearslong criticism of the law and called for it to be scrapped or overhauled.",
      "In a possible preview, the Senate voted 47-53 along party lines Monday not to extend the subsidies for a year. Majority Republicans allowed the vote as part of a separate deal with Democrats to speed up votes and send the legislation to the House.",

      "A legislative package to end the government shutdown appears on track",
      "WASHINGTON -- A legislative package to end the government shutdown appears on track Monday after a handful of Senate Democrats joined with Republicans to break the impasse in what has become a deepening disruption of federal programs and services, the longest in history.",
      "What's in and out of the bipartisan deal drew sharp criticism and leaves few senators fully satisfied. The legislation provides funding to reopen the government, including for SNAP food aid and other programs, while also ensuring backpay for furloughed federal workers the Trump administration had left in doubt.",
      "But notably lacking is any clear resolution to expiring health care subsidies that Democrats have been fighting for as millions of Americans stare down rising insurance premiums. That debate was pushed off for a vote next month, weeks before the subsidies are set to expire.",
      "President Donald Trump noted the deal as he arrived at the White House after watching the Washington Commanders' game on Sunday evening against the Detroit Lions, on the 40th day of the funding lapse. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re getting close to the shutdown ending,\u201d he said.",
      "The Senate could wrap up passage as soon as Monday. The bill cleared a procedural hurdle, 60-40, late Sunday, with eight Democrats joining most Republicans. In a rare dissent, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York voted against because it failed to fully address the health care funds.",
      "It would next go to the House, where lawmakers have been away since September but were being told to prepare to return to Washington this week. Then, it's to Trump's desk for his signature.",
      "Here's a look at the deal as it's moving through Congress:",
      "Included is funding to keep much of the federal government running for the next couple of months, to Jan. 30, with a stopgap measure. It largely funds government operations at their current rates.",
      "Yet in a breakthrough for what's considered a more normal appropriations process, the package also includes several bills to fully fund other government operations including agricultural programs and military construction along with veterans' affairs for the full fiscal year, through September 2026.",
      "Additionally, the package ensures states would be reimbursed for money they spent to keep the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and the Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC, running during the shutdown.",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said she was \u201crelieved.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis shutdown has gone on far too long,\" she said. \"And I also think it\u2019s highly significant that we\u2019ll have three yearlong appropriations bills attached. Veterans Day is coming very soon, and it would be wonderful if we get the full-year Veterans Affairs bill signed into law.\u201d",
      "The Democrats failed to secure their main demand during the shutdown, which was an extension of the health care subsidies that many of the 24 million people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act rely on to help defray costs.",

      "One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against advancing the package Sunday, and he is said to have concerns over a hemp industry provision. And three ultra-conservative GOP senators held up voting for more than two hours as they demanded consideration of their ideas. It is unclear if any of them plans to stage further protests.",
      "Democrats, who have fought for the past month in their hopes of preserving the health care subsidies, also could delay final passage, and their next steps are uncertain.",
      "And the package faces fresh scrutiny once it goes to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana holds a slim GOP majority and would likely need almost all Republicans to support the bill in the face of objections from Democrats who are holding out for the health care funds.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the party will fight the bill, forcing the Republicans in the House to pass it largely on their own.",

      "Air travelers should expect worsening cancellations and delays this week even if the government shutdown ends, as the Federal Aviation Administration rolls out deeper cuts to flights at 40 major U.S. airports, officials said Monday.",
      "The fourth day of the flight restrictions saw airlines scrap over 2,300 flights Monday and more than 1,000 flights set for takeoff Tuesday. Unpaid for more than a month, some air traffic controllers have begun calling out of work, citing stress and the need to take on second jobs.",
      "President Donald Trump took to social media on Monday to pressure controllers to \u201cget back to work, NOW!!!\u201d He called for a $10,000 bonus for those who've stayed on the job and suggested docking pay for those who haven't.",
      "Rep. Rick Larsen, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and Sen. Tammy Duckworth, ranking member of the Senate\u2019s Aviation Subcommittee, condemned the president\u2019s remarks, saying controllers deserve appreciation and support \u2014 not attacks.",
      "The head of the controllers union says its members are being used as a \u201cpolitical pawn\u201d in the shutdown fight.",
      "Meanwhile, the Senate passed legislation Monday to reopen the government, though the bill also needs to clear the House and final passage could be days away. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy made clear last week that flight cuts will remain in place until the FAA sees staffing levels stabilize at its air traffic control facilities.",
      "And because the flight disruptions are widespread and ongoing, many planes aren\u2019t where they\u2019re supposed to be, which could also slow the airlines\u2019 return to normal operations even after the FAA lifts the order, said Mike Taylor, who leads research on airports and airlines at J.D. Power.",
      "\u201cIf you think about it, there\u2019s all these aircraft that didn\u2019t fly where they were supposed to on a normal route,\u201d Taylor said, noting airlines will need to track down all their planes, figure out where each needs to be, and find pilots and cabin crew for those flights.",
      "Since Friday, airlines have canceled about 8,000 flights under orders to drop 4% of flights at 40 of the nation\u2019s busiest airports. That will rise to 6% on Tuesday and 10% by week's end, the FAA says.",
      "One in 10 flights nationwide were scratched Sunday \u2014 the fourth worst day for cancellations in almost two years, according aviation analytics firm Cirium.",
      "Controller shortages also led to five-hour delays Monday evening at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport, where wintry weather added to the disruptions earlier in the day, and the FAA warned that staffing at over a dozen towers and control centers could cause delays in cities including Philadelphia, Nashville and Atlanta.",

      "The FAA also expanded flight restrictions Monday, barring business jets and many private flights from using a dozen airports already under commercial flight limits.",
      "Airports nationwide have seen intermittent delays since the shutdown began because the FAA slows air traffic when it's short on controllers to ensure flights remain safe.",

      "During the six weekends since the shutdown began, an average of 30 air traffic control facilities had staffing issues. That\u2019s almost four times the number on weekends this year before the shutdown, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans sent through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center system.",

      "The Dallas Mavericks have fired general manager Nico Harrison",
      "The Dallas Mavericks fired general manager Nico Harrison on Tuesday, an admission nine months later that the widely criticized trade of Luka Doncic backfired on the franchise.",
      "The move came a day after Mavericks governor Patrick Dumont attended a 116-114 loss to Milwaukee in which fans again chanted \u201cfire Nico,\u201d a familiar refrain since the blockbuster deal that brought Anthony Davis from the Los Angeles Lakers and angered the Dallas fan base.",
      "The Mavericks appointed Michael Finley and Matt Riccardi as co-interim general managers to oversee basketball operations.",
      "Dumont\u2019s hope for goodwill with the fans never came even after Dallas landed No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg with just a 1.8% chance to win the draft lottery.",
      "There have been plenty of empty seats in the upper deck of American Airlines Center this season, something not seen consistently since 2018, when the Mavericks traded up to get Doncic with the third overall pick.",
      "Doncic was a 25-year-old generational point guard in his prime when Harrison unloaded him for the oft-injured Davis, who has missed 30 of 44 regular-season games since his arrival in February.",
      "Harrison was in his fourth season and had engineered three trades that helped the Mavs go on a run to the Western Conference finals in 2022 and the NBA Finals two years later.",
      "The Doncic trade and a slow start to the first full season without the young superstar led to a stunning downfall. Dallas is 3-8, and Davis has missed six of the 11 games with a calf injury.",
      "Dumont approved Harrison\u2019s decision to trade Doncic, which kept the Mavericks from having to commit to a $346 million, five-year supermax extension for the Slovenian star.",
      "Harrison tried to defend the deal by repeating a \u201cdefense wins championships\u201d line. But with Davis sidelined by a calf injury and star guard Kyrie Irving still out after tearing the ACL in his left knee last March, defense hasn\u2019t mattered much because Dallas has one of the worst offenses in the NBA.",
      "With Davis and Irving playing together for just part of one game last season, the Mavericks missed the playoffs a year after Doncic led them to the NBA Finals.",
      "The slow, injury-plagued start to this season for the Mavericks coincided with Doncic joining Wilt Chamberlain as the only NBA players to open a season with three consecutive games of at least 40 points.",

      "The hiring of Harrison was the first step in trying to restore stability after former general manager Donnie Nelson was fired, then Rick Carlisle resigned as coach a day later. Nelson and Carlisle had been together for 13 years.",
      "Harrison hired Jason Kidd as coach, and the Mavericks reached the Western Conference finals their first season together after Harrison\u2019s first blockbuster trade.",
      "He broke up the European pairing of Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis and got Spencer Dinwiddie, who played a key supporting role with Doncic as the Mavericks stunned Phoenix with a Game 7 blowout in the second round before losing to Golden State in five games.",
      "A year later, Dinwiddie was part of the next blockbuster trade, which brought Irving from Brooklyn. The Mavericks faltered the rest of that season largely because of injuries, but they reached their first NBA Finals in 13 years in 2023-24, led by the pair of star guards.",
      "Cuban sold the Mavericks to the Las Vegas-based casino families of Dumont and Miriam Adelson just a few months before the run to the NBA Finals. He said at the time of the sale that he would maintain control of basketball operations, but that didn\u2019t happen.",
      "Dumont quickly put full control of the basketball side in the hands of Harrison, who saw Davis as a championship-caliber player in the mold of Bryant. Davis won a title with LeBron James and the Lakers in 2020.",
      "Cuban criticized the trade of Doncic, saying he never would have approved it and adding that he didn\u2019t think Dallas got enough in return. Months later, though, Cuban credited Harrison for his salary cap management.",

      "The NFL has seen a surge in international interest, with the first batch of tickets for the first regular-season game in Spain selling out quickly",
      "MADRID -- The initial batch of tickets for the first regular-season NFL game in Madrid were gone in a matter of hours, with nearly 700,000 people trying to get a seat to watch the Miami Dolphins play the Washington Commanders on Sunday at Real Madrid\u2019s iconic Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.",
      "For the first game in Ireland last month, organizers said some 600,000 digital devices were logged on to try to buy tickets for the Pittsburgh Steelers' game against the Minnesota Vikings at Dublin\u2019s famed Croke Park.",

      "The host cities themselves have treated the games as their Super Bowls, with a series of promotional events and fan activities planned in the weeks ahead and high-profile artists performing at halftime. They have generated massive fan interest locally and attracted fans from nearby European countries, allowing host cities to gain financially and in visibility.",
      "Gerrit Meier, managing director and head of NFL International, said organizers went into the game in Dublin last month with \u201ca real sense of a mini Super Bowl coming to town.\u201d",
      "There were NFL experiences and shops brought to iconic venues, and murals and light projections were visible throughout the Irish city. Similar activities were being promoted for Spain\u2019s inaugural game in Madrid.",
      "Puerto Rican superstar Daddy Yankee and Argentine producer Bizarrap are set to perform at halftime in Madrid. British singer Myles Smith was the star at halftime in Dublin, while Grammy award-winning artist Karol G performed in Sao Paulo in September. Grammy-nominated Kid Laroi was the headliner for Berlin's first regular-season game last week, while the games in London included shows by British singer Raye and British rapper Giggs.",
      "The three games played in London this season took the total there to 42 games since 2007, which is when the NFL officially kicked off its push to grow internationally with regular-season games abroad. The league has been aggressively expanding in recent years, and the seven games played internationally this season are the most ever for the NFL. Next year, it will go to Australia and add a game in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",
      "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has reiterated that the league plans to increase the number of international games to a point where each team will get to play a game abroad every year. He said in September that the NFL also wants to play in Asia. The league may also look at possible locations for a game in Abu Dhabi in United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia could possibly be in the mix as well.",
      "\u201cProbably a day doesn\u2019t go by where someone on our international team doesn\u2019t receive outreach from a city or an entity interested in working with the NFL and potentially hosting a game,\u201d said Peter O\u2019Reilly, the NFL vice president in charge of international affairs. \u201dThere\u2019s very strong interest.

      "The estimated economic impact for London since the first game was played there in 2007 has reportedly reached $2.6 billion. The first time the NFL played in Germany in 2022, the economic impact was more than $80 million for the Munich area, and Spain expects similar numbers, according to some local estimates.",

The Dolphins will be playing their eighth regular-season game abroad, second only to the 14 played by the Jacksonville Jaguars.",

      "A power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, is impacting global auto production",
      "A battle for control of a little-known chipmaker has threatened global auto production by choking off the semiconductor supply chain, though there are signs the crisis is inching toward a resolution.",
      "The power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, highlights how technology supply chain vulnerabilities are squeezing auto makers, most notably forcing Honda to halt production at a Mexican factory making its popular HR-V crossover for North American markets. It also exposes how Europe is caught in the middle of the wider geopolitical showdown between Washington and Beijing.",
      "Here's a look at the dispute:",
      "The turmoil erupted into public view in mid-October, when the Dutch government announced it had invoked a rarely used World War II-era law to take effective control of Nexperia weeks earlier.",
      "The Dutch ministry of economic affairs said it took action because of national security concerns. Officials said they intervened because of \u201cserious governance shortcomings\u201d at Nexperia, asserting control to prevent the loss of crucial tech know-how that could threaten Europe's economic security.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s Chinese owner Wingtech Technology, a partially state-owned company, is at the heart of the dispute. Amid the boardroom battle, a Dutch court granted the ministry's request to oust Nexperia's Chinese CEO Zhang Xuezheng. American officials told the Dutch government he would have to be replaced to avoid trade restrictions, according to a court filing.",
      "Nexperia makes simple semiconductors such as switches and logic chips. The auto industry \u2014 one of Nexperia's biggest markets \u2014 uses its chips for numerous functions, such as adaptive LED headlight controllers, electric vehicle battery management systems and anti-lock brakes.",
      "Headquartered in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, Nexperia was spun off from Philips Semiconductors two decades ago. It was eventually purchased by China's Wingtech Technology in 2018 for $3.6 billion.",
      "Nexperia has wafer fabrication plants in Britain and Germany. It operates an assembly and testing center in China's southern manufacturing heartland of Guangdong \u2014 which accounts for around 70% of its end-product capacity \u2014 and similar centers in the Philippines and Malaysia.",
      "The dispute is part of the broader struggle between the U.S. and China over tech supremacy, which has left Europe caught in the middle.",
      "It stems from Washington\u2019s decision late last year to place Wingtech on its \u201centity list,\" which subjects companies to export controls because of national security risks. In late September, the U.S. expanded that list to Wingtech\u2019s subsidiaries, including Nexperia, pressuring allies to follow suit.",
      "After the Dutch government asserted control of Nexperia, Beijing responded soon after, blocking the export of Nexperia chips from its assembly plant in the Chinese city of Dongguan. It blamed the Netherlands for \u201cturmoil and chaos\u201d in the chip supply chain.",
      "There were signs of hope following last month's high-profile meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, when the White House said Beijing would ease the export ban as part of a U.S.-China trade truce.",
      "Despite Beijing also confirming exports would be allowed to resume, Nexperia\u2019s Chinese unit said headquarters suspended shipments of wafers used to make chips to its Chinese factory, potentially crimping its ability to deliver finished products.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s head office hit back in a statement Wednesday, saying the Chinese unit refused to pay for the wafers and accused it of \u201cignoring the lawful instructions\" from its global management team. The company said it can\u2019t guarantee the quality of any chips delivered from its China plant since Oct. 13.",
      "Modern automobiles rely on so-called discrete chips made by companies like Nexperia, which, unlike more advanced microprocessors, perform a single function. Leaders at big carmakers spelled out their worries in the latest round of earnings calls, saying that finding a replacement for Nexperia at scale in the short term will be difficult.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Don\u2019t lose sleep over headlines linking melatonin to heart failure.",
      "That\u2019s the message after some scary-sounding reports about a preliminary study involving the sleep-related supplement. It raised questions about the safety of long term use of melatonin for insomnia.",
      "Doctors have long known that too little or interrupted sleep raises the risk of heart disease. But heart experts say this kind of so-called observational study can't prove that melatonin use plays any role \u2014 instead of the insomnia patients were trying to treat.",
      "\u201cWe should not raise the alarm and tell patients to stop taking all their melatonin,\u201d said Dr. Pratik Sandesara, an interventional cardiologist at Emory Healthcare who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",

      "People may take lab-produced melatonin to help them fall asleep or to adjust for jet lag or time changes.",
      "The new study used international electronic health records, tracking adults diagnosed with insomnia who had a melatonin prescription that suggested they used the supplement for at least a year.",
      "Over five years, 4.6% of the chronic melatonin users developed heart failure compared to 2.7% of insomnia patients whose charts showed no melatonin use, the researchers found. The study is being presented at an American Heart Association meeting but hasn\u2019t undergone peer review.",
      "But only certain countries require a melatonin prescription. It\u2019s over-the-counter in the U.S., meaning Americans in the study might have used the supplements without it being recorded, said Northwestern University cardiology chief Dr. Clyde Yancy, who wasn't involved in the study. The study also did not show dosages.",
      "Also, U.S. supplements don\u2019t require government approval, meaning brands can vary in their ingredients. The researchers, from SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, characterized the findings as a call for more research.",
      "Meanwhile, patients wondering about melatonin should talk it over with their doctors, said Emory\u2019s Sandesara. Generally doctors recommend it for short-term use, like for jet lag.",

      "On a foggy Saturday morning in 1953, a tall, skinny 24-year-old man fiddled with shapes he had cut out of cardboard. They represented fragments of a DNA molecule, and young James Watson was trying to figure how they fit together in a way that let DNA do its job as the stuff of genes.",

      "His first reaction: \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d",
      "But it was more than that. Discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was a breakthrough that would help open the way to a revolution in medicine, biology and other fields as diverse as crime-fighting, genealogy and ethics.",
      "Watson died Thursday, according to his former research lab. The Chicago-born scientist was 97 years old. His career was marked by significant achievements, including his role in mapping the human genome. However, his legacy is complicated by controversial remarks on race, which led to his condemnation and loss of honorary titles.",

      "Watson shared the Nobel Prize with collaborator Francis Crick and scientist Maurice Wilkins. They were aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in his book \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked.",
      "Both of his Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004. Franklin died in 1958.",
      "Their discovery instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how a cell duplicates its DNA before dividing so that each resulting cell inherits a copy. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.",

      "Among non-scientists, the double helix has become an instantly recognized symbol of science. And for researchers, it helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees.",
      "That in turn has raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering a person\u2019s genome in a way that is transmitted to one\u2019s offspring.",
      "Watson\u2019s initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease, maybe in time to help his son.",
      "Watson never made another lab finding as big as the double helix. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",

      "In the decades after his discovery, Watson\u2019s fame persisted. Apple Computer used his picture in an ad campaign. At conferences, graduate students who weren\u2019t even born when he worked at Cambridge nudged each other and whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s Watson. There\u2019s Watson.\u201d They got him to autograph napkins or copies of \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d",
      "A reporter asked him 2018 if any building at the Cold Spring Harbor lab was named after him. No, Watson replied, \u201cI don\u2019t need a building named after me. I have the double helix.\u201d",
      "His 2007 remarks on race were not the first time Watson struck a nerve with his comments. In a speech in 2000, he suggested that sex drive is related to skin color. And earlier he told a newspaper that if a gene governing sexuality were found and could be detected in the womb, a woman who didn\u2019t want to have a gay child should be allowed to have an abortion.",
      "More than a half-century after winning the Nobel, Watson put the gold medal up for auction in 2014. The winning bid, $4.7 million, set a record for a Nobel. The medal was eventually returned to Watson.",

In her review, Jocelyn Noveck writes, \u201cThe chief weakness of \u2018Freakier Friday\u2019 \u2014 an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante.

    "story": [
      "Lisa Emery, a respiratory therapist, is deeply concerned about West Virginia coal miners suffering from black lung disease",
      "OAK HILL, W.Va. -- Lisa Emery loves to talk about her \u201cboys.\u201d With each word, the respiratory therapist\u2019s face softens and shines with pride. But keep her talking, and it doesn\u2019t take long for that passion to switch to hurt. She knows the names, ages, families and the intimate stories of each one\u2019s scarred lungs. She worries about a whole community of West Virginia coal miners \u2014 including a growing number in their 30s and 40s \u2014 who come to her for help while getting sicker and sicker from what used to be considered an old-timer\u2019s disease: black lung.",
      "\u201cI love these guys,\u201d she said, wiping tears. \u201cI tell them \u2026 \u2018Every single one of y\u2019all that sits down in that chair is why I feel like I was put on this earth.\u2019\u201d",
      "As director of the New River Health Association Black Lung Clinic, Emery\u2019s seen guys as young as 45 getting double lung transplants as disease rates soar among miners forced to dig through more rock filled with deadly silica to reach the remaining coal \u2014 far worse than the dust their grandfathers inhaled. A rule approved last year by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration would cut the federal limit for allowable respirable crystalline silica dust exposure by half to help protect miners of all types nationwide from the current driving force of black lung and other illnesses.",
      "But, now, it\u2019s in jeopardy amid other Trump administration cutbacks and proposals targeting workers\u2019 health and safety guardrails: Stuck in a politically charged environment that promotes industry, with lawmakers arguing to change it and the federal agency that wrote the rule not pushing to enforce it. Some angry retired miners with black lung are fighting back, demanding that President Donald Trump honor promises he made to the people who voted him in.",
      "The opposition comes months after Trump signed executive orders to allow coal-fired plants to pollute more and to streamline the permitting process and open up new areas for mineral production, including oil and natural gas drilling and mining of \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201d He was celebrated at the White House by smiling miners in hard hats, including some with West Virginia stickers, as he promised to put more people to work underground.",
      "\u201cOne thing I learned about the coal miners: That\u2019s what they want to do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou could give them a penthouse on Fifth Avenue in a different kind of a job, and they\u2019d be unhappy. They want to mine coal.\u201d",
      "But since his inauguration in January, a volley of firings, department eliminations and proposed regulation rollbacks have targeted hard-won health and safety protections fought for over decades to safeguard coal miners and other working-class folks.",
      "The silica rule was delayed in April after industry groups suing the government filed an emergency request in court to block it from taking effect, citing costs and difficulties implementing it. Around the same time, the Trump administration told nearly all employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health that their jobs were being cut. That included those running a congressionally mandated surveillance program that certifies black lung cases.",
      "Loud public uproar and bipartisan criticism followed, and a fraction of the agency\u2019s positions were reinstated. That came only after a West Virginia coal miner diagnosed with black lung sued. A federal judge in that case issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to bring back respiratory health division workers at NIOSH.",
      "But some jobs, including those focused on mine safety and research, have not been restored. And even employees who have been recalled say a lack of funding and loss of expertise in specialized positions, from chemists to engineers, have made it impossible for them to operate at the same level as before.",
      "In addition, the Labor Department has proposed altering some mining regulations to weaken the authority of district mine health and safety managers that could impact ventilation, roof prevention and training programs.",
      "The result of all these changes is that many blue-collar workers and first responders nationwide \u2014 from commercial fishermen and miners to firefighters and construction workers \u2014 will have fewer people working to help keep them safe and healthy while doing some of the country\u2019s most dangerous jobs, many of them deep in Trump country.",
      "In fact, the two reddest states in America \u2014 Wyoming and West Virginia \u2014 had the highest overall worker death rates in 2023, according to the latest government figures. Together they experienced more than a dozen fatalities in the mining, quarrying and oil and gas sector that year.",
      "As a United Steelworkers union leader representing about 700 trona miners in Wyoming, Marshal Cummings worries the little-known white powdery rock he digs \u2014 used in everything from glass and detergents to paper \u2014 could be making workers sick. He helped push for the silica rule to cover miners like him, offering them the same free health screenings as coal miners, and was forced to wait for researchers from NIOSH to investigate air quality at his site after a request he filed was initially killed by the layoffs.",
      "\u201cWe got promised that we were going to make America great again, make America healthy again,\u201d Cummings said at the time.",
      "\u201cYou should be making these cuts with the scalpel,\u201d he added. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be using a chainsaw and chunking out all these things because you\u2019re impacting workers.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the country, Emery sits in her office off a busy highway nestled amid West Virginia\u2019s breathtaking mountains and whitewater rivers that attract tourists from across the world. Data collected from her clinic along with more than two dozen others nationwide, spell out what she sees in real time every day: Of the 11,500 coal miners from central Appalachia with X-rays analyzed by NIOSH-certified readers from mid-2020 through mid-2025, 55% had some form of black lung with the highest annual rate \u2014 62% \u2014 recorded among miners seen in the past year, according to researcher Kirsten Almberg at the University of Illinois Chicago. That compares to 41% elsewhere in the U.S. over the same five-year period.",
      "Experts say that\u2019s because much of the easy-to-reach coal has already been extracted in West Virginia and neighboring Virginia and Kentucky, forcing miners to use massive equipment to eat through walls of quartz-filled sandstone to reach the remaining thin coal seams. This creates excess dust laced with shards of silica, which also cause lung cancer and kidney disease. It\u2019s 20 times more toxic than coal dust, the major culprit of the past that often sickened older workers. The silica crystals embed in miners\u2019 lungs, causing chronic inflammation and eventually irreversible scarring that peppers X-rays with chalky spots.

      "He said he wore his protective respirator throughout his nearly 30-year career, but was still diagnosed with a progressive form of complicated black lung and silicosis when he was 45. NIOSH certified his X-ray, allowing him to move to a job on the surface with no pay cut. Now, just four years later, he said he doesn\u2019t have the wind to mow his lawn.",
      "He said he worries about younger miners. Some, no longer protected by unions, were afraid to speak to The Associated Press or question bosses who may be skirting health and safety regulations.",
      "From 1970 to 2016, more than 75,000 miners\u2019 deaths were connected to black lung, according to NIOSH. Disease rates dropped after Congress put the agency\u2019s Coal Workers\u2019 Health Surveillance Program in place, but have surged since the late 1990s. NIOSH and unions have highlighted the need for the silica rule for decades, which cuts permissible silica dust levels inside mines from 100 to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over an eight-hour shift \u2014 the same levels already enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in other industries such as construction. In 2018, NIOSH published a report showing around one in five coal miners with at least 25 years\u2019 experience in central Appalachia had black lung. Those findings were based largely off of working miners who may not have been sick when X-rayed. Researchers say the newer numbers collected from black lung clinics like Emery\u2019s show a bleaker picture because they capture miners who are disabled or retired, many of whom were never screened by NIOSH.",
      "In July, seven House Republicans, led by Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, who chairs the House Education and Workforce committee, wrote a letter to the Mine Safety and Health Administration opposing parts of the silica rule, saying it ignored commonsense controls such as job rotation and personal protective equipment. The letter did not mention black lung or other diseases caused by silica dust, but said the rule was an example of Biden administration red tape and \u201cimposed hundreds of millions of dollars in costs\u201d on the mining industry.",
      "Walberg did not respond to questions from AP, but a committee spokesperson said in a statement that while the Republicans support ensuring miner safety, the current silica rule does not provide mine operators enough flexibility to apply the standards in an economically feasible way.",
      "The White House and the Labor Department insisted the administration can maintain miners\u2019 health and safety while rolling back regulations.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump cares about our miners more than any other president in modern history \u2013 which is why he has implemented his energy dominance agenda to protect their jobs and revive the mining industry,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.",
      "But sick miners say the cost, for them, is their lives. Even after removing all exposure to silica and coal dust, symptoms continue to worsen, typically resulting in only two options: A risky, expensive lung transplant or death.",
      "\u201cI feel like in our part of the country \u2026 we\u2019re kinda forgotten about,\u201d said John Robinson, a former miner from Nickelsville, Virginia, who uses a walking stick and oxygen after being diagnosed with the disease 12 years ago at age 47. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "Emery said her youngest patient with the most complicated form of black lung, called progressive massive fibrosis, was just 31 when he was diagnosed after only 10 years underground. And he\u2019s not alone: Rates in the region have jumped in recent years \u2014 hitting an all-time high for long-tenured miners in the mid-2000s, according to NIOSH data.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing at the black lung clinics is just really alarming,\u201d she said. \u201cSo truly, if the rule got put in place today, cutting the silica exposure level in half, you already have sick miners. It\u2019s going to take a solid 15 to 20 years for us to start to see this taper off.\u201d",
      "The history of disease and sacrifice is everywhere in these mountains. Just a few miles from Emery\u2019s office, silica created one of the worst occupational disasters in U.S. history when more than 750 miners \u2014 most of them Black \u2014 died from breathing the toxic dust while drilling the Hawks Nest tunnel in the early 1930s to divert water to power a metal plant.

      "It was the first mining disaster broadcast on national television, shocking the public and enraging workers. A few months later, roughly 40,000 West Virginia coal miners walked off the job in an unauthorized wildcat strike, demanding better black lung protections and benefits when the state was a Democratic stronghold. Congress responded by passing the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which required government oversight and enforcement at coal mines and established breathable dust standards \u2014 the same ones the 2024 silica rule would cut in half \u2014 and compensation for miners disabled by black lung.",
      "The federal black lung surveillance program was created as part of that act, which also helped lay the framework for broader workplace safety legislation a year later that formed OSHA and NIOSH as agencies. While OSHA is charged with enforcing worker health and safety standards under the Department of Labor, including citing employers for violations, NIOSH is the quiet research and development arm. It focuses on making recommendations to avoid work-related illness and injury and is overseen by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

      "Unions estimate around 500 employees remain on administrative leave while their future is hashed out in court after lawsuits were filed to have the jobs reinstated. Others took buyouts or have accepted positions elsewhere. The Trump administration has attacked federal employee unions, including those representing the agency, attempting to strip collective bargaining rights. That too has prompted lawsuits.",
      "NIOSH was slated to become part of the newly planned Administration for a Healthy America, and Kennedy proposed its budget for fiscal year 2026 be slashed to $73 million \u2014 an 80% decrease from the previous year. Meanwhile, in September, the Trump administration provided $625 million in funding to expand and improve coal-powered plants.",
      "Prior to the government shutdown, the House and Senate appropriations committees recommended the agency\u2019s funding either be slightly reduced or maintained near pre-Trump levels. Experts have argued NIOSH is a bargain, costing about $2.20 per working American annually. In 2023, the nonprofit National Safety Council found workplace injuries alone amount to about $177 billion each year.",
      "\u201cWe like to say that NIOSH is the little agency that no one\u2019s heard of that\u2019s probably helped save your life,\u201d said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, an industrial hygienist at the agency\u2019s Cincinnati offices, who spoke as vice president of the AFGE Local 3840 union. \u201cEvery single workplace safety and health regulation is written in blood.\u201d",

All they\u2019re worried about is the almighty dollar in D.C. They don\u2019t care about the little people that put them there.\u201d",
      "Outgoing United Mine Workers of America union president Cecil Roberts went a step further, accusing those delaying the silica rule of holding a pillow over miners\u2019 faces, suffocating workers. The UMWA has tried to intervene in the silica rule lawsuit to help push for its enforcement, but government lawyers have opposed it.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s stop the killing in Appalachia!\u201d he yelled into the crowd. \u201cThis country owes coal miners so much. \u2026 We allowed those fat-ass people up on Wall Street to be millionaires and billionaires. It\u2019s our turn!\u201d",
      "The silica rule lawsuit is backed by a number of industry groups that represent different types of mining nationwide.",
      "\u201cWe are absolutely supportive of the new lower levels,\u201d said Ashley Burke, a spokeswoman at the National Mining Association, which is part of the lawsuit. She said the problem is instead with how the new rule is regulated.",
      "Industry wants it to match more closely with OSHA\u2019s methods of compliance, including allowing personal protective equipment to be used more to help meet the standards. But the mining rule calls for company ventilation systems and dust suppression devices to be used as part of the primary means of control.",
      "Miners say respirators clog up frequently, making it hard to breathe, and they often slip or don\u2019t seal properly due to beards, sweat or coal dust. They can also make it difficult for them to hear, see or talk in the noisy environment underground.",
      "Retired miners who attended the rally say they also are pushing to make sure the Mine Safety and Health Administration isn\u2019t weakened. Wayne Palmer was recently confirmed to lead the agency, which has seen a dwindling number of inspectors. Palmer previously worked as an executive for an industrial minerals trade association that filed a legal brief opposing the silica rule. Protest organizers say they asked to meet with Palmer, but never got a reply. The Labor Department did not respond to specific questions about the silica rule or whether Palmer planned to address the group.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like having a fox in a chicken house,\u201d said Gary Hairston, 71, president of the National Black Lung Association, who came out of the mines in southern West Virginia sick at 48 years old. He said coal companies cannot be trusted to police themselves, adding he used to put tape over his air monitor to make sure he didn\u2019t get bad samples because he feared being fired. He said the company also alerted miners when inspectors arrived to make sure all the safety violations were hidden. \u201cYou ain\u2019t got nobody to go to.\u201d",
      "The Mine Safety and Health Administration houses inspectors who would be responsible for enforcing the silica rule, which the agency agreed to pause in April, citing restructuring at NIOSH and technical issues. This administration did not push back against the industry lawsuit in federal appeals court and was granted another delay in October, due to the government shutdown. The Labor Department has also proposed changes that would limit district managers\u2019 authority to force mines to comply with ventilation, roofing and training regulations to carry out Trump\u2019s directive to eliminate bureaucracy.",
      "But at Emery\u2019s black lung clinic in southern West Virginia, far from the lawsuits and the policy changes, all she can think about is one gasping miner arriving after another. Many are still working with limited lung capacity just to keep their health insurance, and they come to her with questions, hoping she can help delay the inevitable. She sees the young ones struggling to throw a football in the yard or make it to school sporting events.",
      "\u201cThese families, you know, they\u2019re my families,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s miners whose kids go to school with my kids.\u201d",

      "Some facts about typhoons:",
      "They\u2019re all the same \u2014 officially, tropical cyclones. But they get different names in different parts of the world. Hurricane is used in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, central and northeast Pacific. They are typhoons in the northwest Pacific. In the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, they are called cyclones.",
      "Tropical cyclone is used in the southwest India Ocean; in the southwestern Pacific and southeastern India Ocean, they are severe tropical cyclones.",
      "A storm gets a name and is considered a tropical storm at 39 mph (63 kph). It becomes a hurricane, typhoon, tropical cyclone, or cyclone at 74 mph (119 kph). There are five strength categories, depending on wind speed. The highest category is 5 and that\u2019s above 155 mph (249 kph). Australia has a different system for categorizing storm strength.",
      "Kalmaegi is on the stronger side of typhoons, experts said. Its maximum winds in the Philippines reached 132 mph (213 kph), including sustained winds on the ground of 93 mph (150 kph).",
      "The highest tropical cyclone winds recorded were in 2015's Hurricane Patricia in the eastern Pacific, while Typhoon Tip in 1979 had the lowest barometric pressure, which is a key measurement that meteorologists use.",
      "If they are north of the equator they rotate counterclockwise. If they are south, they rotate clockwise.",
      "The Atlantic and central Pacific hurricane seasons are June 1 through Nov. 30. Eastern Pacific is May 15 to Nov. 30; northwestern Pacific season is nearly all year, with the most from May to November. The cyclone season in the south Pacific and Australia runs from November to April. The Bay of Bengal has two seasons, April to June and September to November.",
      "Vietnam tends to get landfalling typhoons around this time of year.",
      "The northwestern Pacific where Typhoon Kalmaegi hit is the busiest place on Earth because of the year-round warm water, weak upper-level crosswinds and frequent thunderstorm activity that can provide the seeds for storms to form, said Kristen Corbosiero, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany.",

      "By this time of year, the Northwest Pacific averages 23 named storms, 14 of which become typhoons, according to Colorado State University's storm database. A normal year there involves 27 named storms. Kalmaegi and Fung-Wong are the 26th and 27th named storms, with Kalmaegi the 15th typhoon. While there are slightly more storms than normal, Corbosiero said this has been generally a weaker season. The measurement that meteorologists use, which combines storm strength, frequency and duration, shows this season is only 62% of average so far. Kalmaegi is the fourth-strongest typhoon this season.",
      "By comparison the Atlantic averages 14 named storms a year and this year there have been 13, with the last one, Hurricane Melissa, causing major destruction in Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "Because the Northwest Pacific has warm enough water to fuel storms practically year-round, the key often is storminess in the atmosphere to start something going, Corbosiero said. In this case \u2014 and many others \u2014 it's an atmospheric disturbance called the Madden-Julian Oscillation, often called the MJO. This is a natural system in the tropics that starts around the Indian Ocean and moves eastward, increasing rainfall and storminess ahead of it and suppressing thunderstorm activity behind it. It can circle the globe in 30 to 60 days.",
      "A strong MJO can trigger tropical cyclone activity. It did that this summer in the Northwest Pacific but then sort of shut down as the oscillation moved east, Corbosiero said. But a strong one just moved through, helping with these storms' formation, she said.",

      "Space weather forecasters have issued an alert for incoming severe solar storms",
      "NEW YORK -- Space weather forecasters issued an alert on Tuesday for incoming severe solar storms that could produce colorful northern lights and temporarily disrupt communications.",
      "In the past few days, the sun has burped out several bursts of energy called coronal mass ejections that could reach Earth Tuesday night and early Wednesday. The potential severe geomagnetic storms could disrupt radio and GPS communications, according to forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "How bright the auroras are and how far south they are visible will depend on when the solar bursts get here and how they interact with Earth's atmosphere. The vibrant displays could be visible across much of the northern U.S., and as far south as Alabama and Northern California.",
      "The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come.",
      "Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
      "Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major face-lift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.",
      "Last year, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And soon afterward, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.",
      "The sun\u2019s active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won\u2019t be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and NOAA.",
      "Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth.",
      "When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit. Severe storms are capable of scrambling other radio and GPS communications.",
      "In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and set telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam.",

      "The last major atlas of ancient Roman road networks was published 25 years ago. Since then, advances in technology and other newly accessible sources have greatly expanded researchers\u2019 ability to locate ancient roadways.",
      "Over five years, a team of archaeologists combed through historical records, ancient journals, locations of milestones and other archival data. Scientists then looked for clues in satellite imagery and aerial photography, including recently digitized photos taken from planes during World War II.",
      "When ancient accounts hinted at lost roads in a certain area, researchers analyzed the terrain from above to spot subtle traces \u2014 things like faint differences in vegetation, soil variations or shifts in elevation, as well as traces of ancient engineering like raised mounds or cut hillsides \u2014 that revealed where Roman lanes once ran.",
      "\u201cIt becomes a massive game of connecting the dots on a continental scale,\u201d said Tom Brughmans, an archaeologist and co-author of the study published in Scientific Data.",

      "The updated map fills in more obscure details about \u201csecondary roads, like the country lanes, that connected villas and farms\u201d and other locations, said Brughmans, who's based at Aarhus University in Denmark.",
      "Researchers previously tallied the extent of Roman roads as covering around 117,163 miles (188,555 kilometers). The new work shows nearly 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) of roads across the extent of the Roman Empire, allowing travel from Spain to Syria.",
      "The study added a lot to archaeologists' knowledge of ancient roads in North Africa, the plains of France and in the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece.",

But during that time, they also funded underprivileged schools, immigration reform and efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Now, the billionaire couple is shifting the bulk of their philanthropic resources to Biohub, the pair's science organization, and focusing on using artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discovery. The idea is to develop virtual, AI-based cell models to understand how they work in the human body, study inflammation and use AI to \u201charness the immune system\u201d for disease detection, prevention and treatment.",

Biohub is going to be the main focus of our philanthropy going forward,\u201d Zuckerberg said Wednesday evening at an event at the Biohub Imaging Institute in Redwood City, California. Three other Biohub institutes \u2014 in New York, San Francisco and Chicago, focus on addressing different scientific challenges.",
      "Chan and Zuckerberg have pledged 99% of their lifetime wealth \u2014 from shares of Meta Platforms, where Zuckerberg is CEO \u2014 toward these efforts. Since 2016, when Biohub launched, they have donated $4 billion to basic science research, a figure that does not include operating expenses for running a large-scale computer cluster for life science research. The organization says it is now on track to double that amount over the next decade, with an operating budget of about $1 billion a year.",

      "The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the couple\u2019s charitable organization, has been faced with criticism recently for curtailing its other philanthropic work. Earlier this year, it stopped funding grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion, immigration advocacy and other issues currently in the crosshairs of the Trump administration \u2014 though the focus has been shifting to science and away from social issues for years, the couple says, long before the 2024 election.",
      "\u201cSo we basically looked at the ecosystem of science funding and decided that the place that we can make the biggest impact was on tool development,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd specifically working on long-term projects, 10 to 15 years, where the output of them was taking on a biological challenge that would produce a tool that scientists everywhere could use to accelerate the pace of science.\u201d",

      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones, following a spate of incursions into NATO airspace in recent months that exposed the alliance\u2019s vulnerabilities and put Europe on edge.",
      "The American Merops system, which is small enough to fit in the back of a midsized pickup truck, can identify drones and close in on them, using artificial intelligence to navigate when satellite and electronic communications are jammed.",
      "As well as being deployed in Poland and Romania, Merops will also be used by Denmark, NATO military officials told The Associated Press, part of a move to boost defenses on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank.",
      "The aim is to make the border with Russia so well-armed that Moscow's forces will be deterred from ever contemplating crossing, from Norway in the north to Turkey in the south, the officials said.",
      "The need for such technology became acute after around 20 Russian drones flew into Polish airspace in early September. Multimillion-dollar jets were scrambled to respond to drones which cost tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "Romania later faced a drone incursion, while drones temporarily closed airports in Copenhagen, Munich, Berlin and Brussels. There were also sightings near military bases in Belgium and Denmark.",
      "While the origin of the drones could not always be traced to Russia or linked to its war in Ukraine, the urgent need to bolster defenses is clear. A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of missiles.",
      "\u201cWhat this system does is give us very accurate detection,\u201d said Col. Mark McLellan, assistant chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command. \u201cIt\u2019s able to target the drones and take them down and at a low cost as well \u2026 It\u2019s a lot cheaper than flying an F-35 into the air to take them down with a missile.\u201d",
      "Drones fly low and slow, making them hard to pinpoint on radar systems calibrated for spotting high-speed missiles. They can also be mistaken for birds or planes. The Merops system, NATO officials said, helps plug those gaps.",
      "Merops \u201cbasically flies drones against drones,\u201d said McLellan, either by firing directly at the hostile drone or information from the system can be passed to ground or air forces so that they can shoot it down.",
      "Merops gives commanders \u201ca certain amount of time to be able to assess the threat and decide \u2014 to shoot or not shoot,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Thomas Lowin, deputy chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command.",
      "It can be used to protect both critical infrastructure, such as airports, and armed forces maneuvering in a combat zone, he added.",
      "NATO is now deploying the first systems along the borders of Poland and Romania, while Denmark has also decided to acquire the Merops technology, Lowin said.",
      "Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has invested in Merops, but both he and the company are keeping a low public profile, declining requests for interviews. Defense officials from Poland and Romania also refused to comment publicly.",
      "The Russian incursions have concentrated minds in Europe, highlighting the need for new defenses against a rapidly developing form of warfare. The Merops system is one of many that European militaries would need to tip the scales of a drone war in NATO\u2019s favor.",

      "Russia has conscription and a large military, which means it has more forces immediately deployable than NATO along its borders. The alliance needs to build defenses which offset that manpower advantage by using its technological capabilities, Donahue said.",
      "Merops is the first phase of building those defenses, said Lowin, a process which is forecast to take two to five years.",
      "The drone incursions and the instability on NATO\u2019s eastern flank stem from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, now approaching the end of its fourth year. The conflict has become a crucible for drone development, transforming the battlefield into a testing zone for new technology which now has applications elsewhere in Europe.",

That's thanks to technological advances and the proliferation of generative AI tools, including video generation tools from OpenAI and Google.",
      "These tools give millions of users the ability to easily spit out content, including for nefarious purposes that range from depicting celebrities Taylor Swift and Katy Perry to disrupting elections and humiliating teens and women.",
      "In response, Denmark is seeking to protect ordinary Danes, as well as performers and artists who might have their appearance or voice imitated and shared without their permission.

      "If enacted, Danish citizens would get the copyright over their own likeness. In theory, they then would be able to demand that online platforms take down content shared without their permission. The law would still allow for parodies and satire, though it\u2019s unclear how that will be determined.",
      "Experts and officials say the Danish legislation would be among the most extensive steps yet taken by a government to combat misinformation through deepfakes.",
      "Henry Ajder, founder of consulting firm Latent Space Advisory and a leading expert in generative AI, said that he applauds the Danish government for recognizing that the law needs to change.",
      "\u201cBecause right now, when people say \u2018what can I do to protect myself from being deepfaked?\u2019 the answer I have to give most of the time is: \u2018There isn\u2019t a huge amount you can do,\u2019\" he said, \u201dwithout me basically saying, \u2018scrub yourself from the internet entirely.\u2019 Which isn\u2019t really possible.\"",

      "Some small grocery stores and neighborhood convenience stores are eager for the U.S. government shutdown to end and for their customers to start receiving federal food aid again",
      "A little more than a year ago, Ryan Sprankle welcomed President Donald Trump to one of the three grocery stores his family owns near Pittsburgh. Trump was on the campaign trail; they talked about high grocery prices, and the Republican nominee picked up a bag of popcorn.",
      "But these days, Sprankle would have a different message if Trump or any lawmakers visited his store. He wants them to know that delayed SNAP benefits during the government shutdown hurt his customers and his small, independent chain.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t take away from the most needy people in the country. It\u2019s inhumane,\u201d Sprankle said. \u201cIt's a lack of empathy and it's on all their hands.",
      "The Trump administration froze funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at the end of October, impacting food access for some 42 million Americans. On Monday, the U.S. Senate passed legislation that would reopen the federal government and replenish SNAP funds, but the U.S. House of Representatives still must consider the bill. It's unclear when SNAP payments might resume if the government reopens.",
      "In 2024, SNAP recipients redeemed a little more than $96 billion in benefits, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the program. The majority \u2013 74% -- was spent at superstores and supermarkets, a category that includes big chains like Walmart and Kroger but also some independent stores like Sprankle's.",
      "Around 14% was spent at smaller grocery and convenience stores, businesses often tucked into neighborhoods and more easily accessible to SNAP beneficiaries.",
      "Etharin Cousin, a former director of the United Nations World Food Program and founder of the nonprofit Food Systems for the Future, said the cutoff of SNAP benefits had immediate impacts on grocers and convenience stores of all sizes, most of which operate on slim profit margins of 1% to 2%.",
      "\u201cSNAP isn\u2019t just a social safety net for families. It\u2019s also a local economic engine,\u201d Cousin said. \u201cSNAP benefits flow directly into neighborhoods, stores, regional distributors and community jobs.\u201d",
      "Walmart declined to comment on the impact of the SNAP funding lapse but noted that it has been lowering prices and donating to local food banks. Kroger also declined to comment.",
      "Shoppers not receiving their food benefits affects all retailers but becomes \u201ca big problem more quickly\u201d at small chains, Sprankle said. His Kittanning, Pennsylvania, store gets 25% of its revenue from SNAP, but customers who don't get government assistance also are worried about the shutdown, according to Sprankle. They're spending less, trading down to cheaper goods or heading to food banks, he said.",
      "Sprankle said lower sales cut into the overtime he can offer to the chain's 140 employees. Many are worried about losing their jobs, he said.",
      "\u201cThey have families to feed, they have kids for buy gifts for,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I have to sell my truck, we're going to give Christmas bonuses.\"",

      "Abunaw opened the supermarket in September after years spent selling produce at pop-up markets and in delivery boxes. Only about 12% of Abunaw\u2019s revenue comes from SNAP benefits right now, she said. But without it -- or if SNAP recipients spend less money in her store -- it will slow Forty Acres\u2019 growth and make it harder to pay the workers, suppliers and farmers who depend on her, she said.",
      "\u201cSNAP is currency. I get money I then use in this economy. It's not a food box,\u201d Abunaw said. \u201cThe economic impact of SNAP is larger than the dollars spent.\u201d",
      "The suspended food aid also had an immediate impact on Kanbe\u2019s Markets, a nonprofit that stocks produce in coolers at 110 convenience stores around Kansas City, Missouri. Kanbe\u2019s distributes a mixture of donated food and food purchased from wholesalers to keep prices low, founder and CEO Maxfield Kaniger said.",
      "Kanbe\u2019s also distributes free food to 50 food pantries and soup kitchens around the city.",
      "Kaniger said some of the convenience stores he works with saw their sales drop 10% in the days after Nov. 1, when SNAP benefits weren't paid. At the same time, the food pantries he supplies asked for double or triple their usual orders.",
      "Because it's giving away more food than usual, Kanbe\u2019s has to spend more buying produce for the coolers it stocks. It\u2019s frustrating for Kaniger, who must make decisions quickly before food spoils.",
      "\u201cIt should be enough that people are going without food. Period, end of sentence. People going without food is wrong,\u201d he said.",
      "Babir Sultan sells berries, lemons, potatoes, bananas and other produce from Kanbe\u2019s at his four FavTrip convenience stores in the Kansas City area. His stores are in food deserts, far from other groceries or big retailers, he said, so it's important to him to stock fresh produce for those neighborhoods.",
      "Sultan said foot traffic at his stores fell 8% to 10% in early November after SNAP funding ceased. He decided to offer $10 of free produce to SNAP beneficiaries but said he\u2019s also happy to help out other customers who might be struggling right now.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in need, just ask, we\u2019ll take care of you,\u201d Sultan said. \u201cEverybody is affected whenever the customer is feeling the pinch.\u201d",

      "\u201cI used to tell the kids, \u2018Put a sweatshirt on.\u2019 But when I got sick, I got really thin, and we had to push it up a lot more,\u201d said Berry, 47. \u201cWe burned a lot more fuel last year than we ever did.\u201d",

But MaineHousing is reallocating $2.2 million earmarked for weatherization to make initial payments for roughly 4,000 households that applied early to the broader Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.",
      "Borrowing funds from one program to pay for another is not ideal, but \u201cthis will get the trucks rolling,\u201d said Dan Brennan, director of the quasi-state agency. Over the next few weeks, households that applied in August and September will have money added to their accounts with fuel vendors.",
      "\u201cThis will help prevent heating emergencies for our most vulnerable neighbors, family members, and friends,\u201d Brennan said.",
      "Commonly called LIHEAP, the $4.1 billion program helps 5.9 million households nationwide heat and cool their homes. While the uncertainty over its future is raising concerns across the country, New England officials are particularly concerned given the region\u2019s reliance on oil for heat.

    "story": [
      "Fernando Clark died in the Montgomery County Jail while waiting for psychiatric treatment",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Fernando Clark spent the last 10 months of his life in a jail cell, waiting for psychiatric treatment a court ordered he undergo after he'd been arrested for stealing cigarettes and some fruit from a gas station.",
      "He died while waiting for the treatment that never arrived, found unresponsive in his jail cell.",
      "Clark was just one of hundreds of people across Alabama awaiting a spot in the state's increasingly limited facilities, despite a consent decree requiring the state to address delays in evaluating and providing care for people suffering from mental illness who are charged with crimes.",
      "Seven years since the federal agreement, the problem is only worse. The waitlist for the state's sole secure psychiatric facility is almost five times longer than when it the decree was issued, according to court documents released in September.",
      "Sometimes arrestees are waiting years for placement in a facility designed to treat their illness and ensure they are healthy to go to court, a problem faced by many states around the country.",
      "In Alabama, that means people charged with less serious crimes, like Clark, \u201cspend more time waiting for a bed than if they had just pled guilty,\" said Bill Van Der Pol, a lawyer with the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program, which won the federal consent decree.",
      "In 2010, the Department of Mental Health had its budget cut by $40 million in the wake of the recession. At least 10 state-run psychiatric facilities have closed over the past three decades, leaving only three inpatient facilities with 504 total beds, and just one where men facing criminal charges can receive treatment to restore them to competency.",
      "The lawsuit that led to the consent decree was filed in 2016, alleging delays at every point in the process that violated constitutional due process.",
      "First, there was a wait for psychiatric evaluations. Then if deemed unfit for trial, there was a wait for a spot at the lone secure facility that serves men: Taylor Hardin Secure Medical Facility. Finally, anyone deemed unable to be restored to competency for trial had to wait for longer-term treatment at community based facilities.",
      "The 2018 consent decree gave the state two years to complete all mental health evaluations and reports within 60 days of a court order. A man deemed incompetent for trial should go to Taylor Hardin within 30 days after that.",
      "The state was also required to expand the number of beds for more permanent care if someone cannot be rehabilitated.",
      "Taylor Hardin's waitlist has grown to 273 men, according to an August court filing. That's up from approximately 60 men in 2017. The average wait is well over a year, and more than 30 people on the list have languished more than two years. The state is still in mediation with the plaintiffs.",
      "Nationally, the number of state hospital beds for adults with serious mental health issues reached a historic low in 2023 with 36,150 beds, more than half of them occupied by people who were committed to the hospital through the criminal legal system, according to the nonprofit Treatment Advocacy Center. That's a 17% decline in beds from 2017, the organization found.",
      "\u201cThere really isn't any state where this hasn't become an increasingly visible problem \u2014 and it's actually expanding in scope rapidly over the last decade,\u201d Lisa Daly, the executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center said.",
      "In Nevada, for example, one county was ordered in April to pay $500 per day because defendants did not receive timely treatment. Officials estimated at the time that the payout would be $3.6 million for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, based on the current caseload and wait times, a county memo shows.",
      "In some ways, the worsening trend is part of an intractable paradox, Daly said. Courts are \u201cdoing a better job over time of identifying when mental illness appears to be a factor in why somebody might\u2019ve been arrested or why somebody might be facing criminal charges.\u201d",
      "For example, one study in Colorado found that the number of court-ordered restorations increased from 87 in 2001 to 900 in 2017, according to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "That is a good thing, Daly said. But the infrastructure \u2014 the beds available at secure treatment facilities, along with the staffing levels to make those beds operational \u2014 has not adjusted to the increasing demand.",
      "In other words, instead of waiting for evaluations, now people are waiting for treatment.",
      "\u201cReally what that does is it changes where the bottleneck is,\u201d Daly said.",
      "Alabama has taken steps to address that bottleneck.",

      "However, there is a significant staffing shortage and the added beds will only be usable if \u201cproper staffing is obtained,\u201d the report said. Only about half of the mental health technician and nursing positions are filled at the facility, Alabama Department of Mental Health Commissioner Kim Boswell said at a board meeting in August 2024, according to The Alabama Reflector. Boswell said an average pay increase of roughly $6 an hour in 2024 is helping with recruitment and retention.",
      "The department has trained 94 people for competency restoration programs in jails to relieve the burden on Taylor Hardin, court records show. Programs now exist in five of Alabama\u2019s 67 counties and are slated to expand to three more.",
      "Alabama also has spent $175 million over five years to build six crisis centers with 180 beds across the state to provide a \u201cmore appropriate alternative to incarceration or emergency room visit\u201d for people suffering a mental health crisis, a September audit shows. Those centers have conducted 22,297 evaluations, Boswell testified in September.",
      "Boswell said at a recent budget hearing that her agency is working with the judges presiding over the consent decree to improve the time it takes to get evaluated and then treated.",
      "A spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Mental Health declined to comment in response to multiple e-mailed requests.",
      "Jennifer Tompkins, an Alabama criminal defense attorney, said the root of the problem is not only the number of beds. It can take decades to get released from Taylor Hardin \u2014 either to court, if the mental health crisis has been treated, or into an outpatient program offering more permanent support.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019re guilty because you\u2019re mentally ill and in poverty,\u201d Tompkins said.",
      "One of her clients charged with murder over 10 years ago is still awaiting trial while he remains at a secure facility, where state psychiatrists have issued numerous conflicting assessments of his mental capacity. There is similar backlog for the community-based facilities like the one Clark was waiting for.",
      "Boswell acknowledged those challenges at a recent budget hearing, saying that her agency was working with the judges presiding over the consent decree to improve turnover.",
      "Clark, who was 40 when he died, was known as \u201cPooch,\" a nickname his mom gave him as a kid because he was small and sweet like a puppy.",
      "But he was troubled, with a long history of petty crimes and severe mental health issues.",
      "His sisters said he was often picked up wandering aimlessly miles away from where he lived with family in Montgomery. Permanent treatment was often hard to come by because many facilities would refuse to treat his psychiatric issues because he also took drugs, and he needed to be sober to receive treatment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot. We just had so many different incidents,\u201d Kawanda Key, one of Clark\u2019s older sisters said. Clark did short stints in hospitals, where he would call his sisters and ask them to bring him chocolate. Whenever one of them encountered him on the side of the road, they would try to convince him to come home where he could eat and shower.",
      "Last year, Clark went missing again, skipping out on a 2022 burglary charge. His sisters asked the police to help find him, despite their fear he'd end up in a jail unable to handle his needs. He was eventually found and put in jail in February 2024, and it wasn't until September of that year that his mental illness was deemed untreatable, and he was ordered to stay in jail until a bed could be found for him to receive care.",
      "\u201cHe wasn\u2019t aggressive\u201d Subrina Hamilton, one of Clark's other sisters said, but \u201cthese people in the jail don\u2019t know that.\u201d",
      "His sisters wanted to see him but they weren't on his list of visitors. Another sister, Tameka Clark, would call the jail regularly to check up on him, assured by jail staff that her younger brother was \u201cfine.\u201d",
      "But on Dec. 11, 2024, Clark was found unresponsive in his cell. The temperature in the cell had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 degrees Celsius) at a time when boiler repairs were being done. His autopsy lists congestive heart failure as his cause of death, but Tom Andrew, a forensic pathologist who reviewed the autopsy for The Associated Press, said it left \u201cmore questions than answers.\"",
      "Clark\u2019s autopsy said he had access to water but didn\u2019t give specifics. Given the temperature in his cell, Andrew said, it was \u201cproblematic\u201d that the autopsy didn\u2019t record Clark\u2019s internal body temperature or rule out other signs of dehydration.",
      "Additionally, Andrew noted, jail staff was giving Clark antipsychotic medication at the time of his death that sometimes impairs the body\u2019s ability to regulate temperature, making him especially vulnerable to overheating.",
      "The state law enforcement agency investigating Clark\u2019s death declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation. Montgomery County Sheriff Derrick Cunningham also declined to comment specifically on Clark's death.",
      "Cunningham said jails are ill-equipped to deal with men like Clark as they wait for psychiatric beds. Jails have difficulty identifying mental health issues, administering medication and navigating complicated behavioral issues, he said.",
      "Even with the significant improvements the department is making, Cunningham said, jails will continue to struggle.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the number of beds we got and then the wait time, I mean, it\u2019s still not enough,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- British political commentator Sami Hamdi is going to voluntarily leave the U.S. after spending more than two weeks in immigration detention over what his supporters say was his criticism of Israel. The Trump administration has accused him of cheering on Hamas.",
      "Hamdi, who is Muslim, was on a speaking tour in the U.S. when he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Oct. 26. He had just addressed the annual gala for the Sacramento, California, chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, the day before his arrest.",
      "In a statement late Monday, the organization said Hamdi had \u201cchosen to accept an offer to leave the United States voluntarily.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell. His only real \u2018offense\u2019 was speaking clearly about Israel\u2019s genocidal war crimes against Palestinians,\u201d said the CEO of CAIR\u2019s California chapter, Hussam Ayloush, in a statement.",
      "Hamdi\u2019s detention was part of broader efforts by the Trump administration to identify and potentially expel thousands of foreigners in the United States who it says have either fomented or participated in unrest or publicly supported protests against Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza.",
      "Those enforcement actions have been criticized by civil rights groups as violations of constitutional protections for freedom of speech, which apply to anyone in the United States and not just to American citizens.",
      "Zahra Billoo, Executive Director of CAIR's San Francisco office, said Tuesday that the logistics of Hamdi\u2019s departure were still being worked out but that it might happen later this week. Billoo said there were \u201cno conditions to the voluntary departure\u201d and that he\u2019s not barred from seeking another U.S. visa in the future.",
      "CAIR said Hamdi\u2019s charging document in immigration court did not accuse him of criminal conduct or security concerns but only listed a visa overstay, which they blamed on the government revoking his visa.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in a statement Tuesday that Hamdi had requested voluntary departure and \u201cICE is happily arranging his removal from this country.\u201d",

      "A rural Kansas county has agreed to pay more than $3 million and apologize over a law enforcement raid on a small-town weekly newspaper in August 2023",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- A rural Kansas county has agreed to pay a little more than $3 million and apologize over a law enforcement raid on a small-town weekly newspaper in August 2023 that sparked an outcry over press freedom.",
      "Marion County was among multiple defendants in five federal lawsuits filed by the Marion County Record's parent company, the paper's publisher, newspaper employees, a former Marion City Council member whose home also was raided, and the estate of the publisher's 98-year-old mother, the paper's co-owner, who died the day after the raid. An attorney for the newspaper, Bernie Rhodes, released a copy of the five-page signed agreement Tuesday.",
      "Eric Meyer, the paper's editor and publisher, told The Associated Press he is hoping the size of the payment is large enough to discourage similar actions against news organizations in the future. Legal claims against the city and city officials have not been settled, and Meyer said he believes they will face a larger judgment though he doesn't expect those claims to be resolved for some time.",
      "\u201cThe goal isn\u2019t to get the money. The money is symbolic,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cThe press has basically been under assault.\u201d",
      "The raid triggered a national debate about press freedom focused on Marion, a town of about 1,900 people set among rolling prairie hills about 150 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of Kansas City, Missouri. Meyer\u2019s 98-year-old mother, Joan, lived with him and died of a heart attack that he blamed on the stress of the raid.",
      "Three days after the raid, the local prosecutor said there wasn't enough evidence to justify it. Experts said Marion's police chief at the time, Gideon Cody, was on legally shaky ground when he ordered the raid, and a former top federal prosecutor for Kansas suggested that it might have been a criminal violation of civil rights, saying: \u201cI\u2019d probably have the FBI starting to look.\u201d",
      "Two special prosecutors who reviewed the raid and its aftermath said nearly a year later that the Record had committed no crimes before Cody led the raid, that the warrants signed by a judge contained inaccurate information from an \u201cinadequate investigation\u201d and the searches were not legally justified. Cody resigned as police chief in October 2023.",
      "Cody is scheduled to go to trial in February in Marion County on a felony charge of interfering with a judicial process, accused by the two special prosecutors of persuading a potential witness to withhold information from authorities when they later investigated his conduct. He had pleaded not guilty and did not respond to a text message Tuesday seeking comment about the county's agreement.",

      "The Marion County Commission approved the agreement Monday after discussing it in private for 15 minutes.",
      "A search warrant tied the raid -- which was led by Marion\u2019s police chief -- to a dispute between the newspaper and a local restaurant owner who had accused the Marion County Record of invading her privacy and illegally accessing information about her and her driving record.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina's highest court has refused to stop the execution of a man who killed three people over five days more than 20 years ago while leaving taunting messages for police in the blood of one of his victims.",
      "Stephen Bryant, 44, is scheduled to die at 6 p.m. Friday by firing squad at a Columbia prison.",
      "Lawyers for Bryant made a last ditch appeal arguing the judge who sentenced him to die never got to consider how badly his brain was damaged from his mother\u2019s alcohol and drug use while pregnant.",
      "But the South Carolina Supreme Court rejected that appeal late Monday writing that even if Bryant's defense had done more investigation into whether he had Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, it simply would have given a different reason for his problems while not changing the outcome of a death sentence.",
      "\u201cBy any stretch, (Bryant) demonstrated a high level of planning, decision making, and calculation,\u201d the justices wrote in Monday's unanimous decision.",
      "Bryant is being executed for killing Willard \u201cTJ\u201d Tietjen in his home in October 2004.

      "In what may be their final appeal. Bryant\u2019s lawyers said while his original defense team said he was unnerved in the months before the killings because he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about being sexually abused by relatives as a child, they didn\u2019t detail how that abuse had affected his ability to conform to the law.",
      "Bryant\u2019s lawyers said he didn\u2019t get a full brain scan before his 2008 trial that could have identified in-utero damage that was never repaired, according to court papers.",
      "They also included what they said was newly uncovered evidence including a 2024 interview with a clinical psychologist where Bryant described abuse he suffered from male relatives, his mother, a preacher\u2019s wife and several strippers in his neighborhood before he became a teenager.",
      "The justices sided with prosecutors who said the three killings, along with another shooting and two burglaries mostly along dirt roads in the rural Sumter County east of Columbia weren\u2019t impulsive crimes from a damaged brain but were methodical and cunning.",

      "Half the 10 candidates on the ballot come from the conservative wing of the conference. The difference is more in style than substance. Most U.S. Catholic bishops are reliably conservative on social issues, but some place more emphasis on opposing abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "\u201cThe slate of 10 candidates perfectly reflects the dynamics of the American hierarchy in that it\u2019s split down the middle,\u201d said David Gibson, director of Fordham University\u2019s Center on Religion and Culture.",
      "There is no clear front-runner. The candidates were nominated by their fellow bishops, and the winner will succeed outgoing leader, Military Services Archbishop Timothy Broglio, for a three-year term.

      "DANVILLE, Calif. -- At age 106, Alice Darrow can clearly recall her days as a nurse during World War II, part of a pioneering group that dodged bullets as they hauled packs full of medical supplies and treated the burns and gunshot wounds of troops.",
      "Some nurses were killed by enemy fire. Others spent years as prisoners of war. Most returned home to quiet lives, receiving little recognition.",
      "Darrow sat with patients, even after-hours. One of them had arrived at her hospital on California's Mare Island with a bullet lodged in his heart. He was not expected to survive surgery, yet he would change her life.",
      "\u201cTo them, you\u2019re everything because you\u2019re taking care of them,\u201d she said, sitting at her home in the San Francisco Bay Area town of Danville.",
      "Eighty years after the war ended, a coalition of retired military nurses and others is campaigning to award one of the nation\u2019s highest civilian honors, the Congressional Gold Medal, to all nurses who served in WWII. Other groups, such as the Women Airforce Service Pilots of WWII and the real-life Rosie the Riveters, have already received the honor.",
      "\u201cThe general public doesn\u2019t often recognize, I think, the contribution that the nurses have made in pretty much every war,\u201d said Patricia Upah, a retired colonel who served as an Army nurse in conflicts abroad, and whose late mother was also a Army nurse in the South Pacific in World War II.",
      "Only a handful, like Darrow, are still alive. The coalition knows of five World War II nurses who are still living \u2014 including Elsie Chin Yuen Seetoo, 107, who became the first Chinese American nurse to join the Army Nurse Corps. They fear time is running out to honor the trailblazers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high time we honor the nurses who stepped up and did their part to defend our freedom,\u201d U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said in a statement.",
      "Baldwin and U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, have sponsored legislation to award the medal, but it faces steep odds. It needs two-thirds of each chamber \u2014 67 cosponsors in the Senate and 290 in the House \u2014 and so far, the bills have eight and six cosponsors, respectively.",
      "Before the war, there were fewer than 600 nurses with the U.S. Army and 1,700 with the U.S. Navy. By the end of the war, those numbers had ballooned to 59,000 in the Army and 14,000 in the Navy.",
      "The Congressional bills cite harrowing examples of bravery. Some nurses served on Navy hospital ships treating patients as the vessels came under fire. Sixty nurses landed off the coast of North Africa on Nov. 8, 1942, to set up shop and care for invading troops.",
      "\u201cWithout weapons, they waded ashore amid enemy sniper fire and ultimately took shelter in an abandoned civilian hospital,\" the legislation states.",
      "The nurses saved lives. Fewer than 4% of U.S. soldiers in WWII who received medical care in the field or underwent evacuation died from wounds or disease, the legislation states.",
      "\u201cThey probably saw more infections. They probably saw more chemical casualties. Remember, they didn\u2019t have disposable products, so they had to sterilize everything,\u201d says Edward Yackel, a retired colonel and president of the Army Nurse Corps Association, of World War II nurses.",
      "\u201cWithout them,\u201d he says, \u201cwe would not have the knowledge base we need now to fight the wars of today.\u201d",
      "Some nurses endured harsh captivity. In 1942, nearly 80 military nurses were captured when the U.S. surrendered the Philippines to Japan. Held as prisoners of war, the women endured starvation rations and disease but continued to work until their liberation three years later.",

      "The operators of Camp Mystic in Texas, where 25 girls and two teenage counselors died in catastrophic flooding on July 4, failed to take necessary steps to protect the campers as life-threatening floodwaters approached, families of the victims allege in a lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Monday in state court in Austin, seeks more than $1 million in damages but does not specify an exact amount. It was filed as Camp Mystic has drawn renewed outrage from several victims\u2019 families over plans to reopen the 100-year-old camp next summer.",
      "Among the claims in the lawsuit is that a groundskeeper was directed to spend more than an hour evacuating equipment while girls and counselors in cabins closest to the Guadalupe River were ordered to remain there, even as floodwaters overwhelmed the property.",

      "\u201cThese young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cThe camp chose to house young girls in cabins sitting in flood-prone areas, despite the risk, to avoid the cost of relocating the cabins.\u201d",
      "The suit also alleges the operators of the camp chose not to make plans to safely evacuate campers, despite state rules requiring such plans, and instead ordered campers and counselors to remain in their cabins as a matter of policy.",
      "Defendants named in the lawsuit include Camp Mystic, affiliated entities and its owners, including the estate of camp owner Richard Eastland, who also died in the flooding, and his family members.",
      "A separate lawsuit with similar allegations was filed Monday by the family of Eloise Peck, another Camp Mystic camper who died in the flood. Both lawsuits were filed in Travis County.",

      "Conservation groups are suing over a program that authorizes killing brown and black bears as a way to help grow the size of a southwest Alaska caribou herd",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Conservation groups sued Monday over a state program in Alaska that authorizes killing brown bears and black bears as a way to increase the size of a once-significant caribou herd in the southwest part of the state. The groups allege the program lacks a scientific basis and is unconstitutional.",
      "The lawsuit filed in state court says the program adopted by the Alaska Board of Game in July doesn\u2019t require the Department of Fish and Game to monitor bear populations to ensure their numbers remain sustainable. It also says the program \u2014 carried out by department employees and allowing them to shoot from helicopters \u2014 sets no limits on how many bears can be killed in an area that's roughly the size of Indiana.",
      "Filed by Trustees for Alaska on behalf of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance and the Center for Biological Diversity, the lawsuit lists as defendants the state, the board, the Department of Fish and Game and the department's commissioner. A message seeking comment was sent to the Alaska Department of Law, which typically represents state agencies in litigation.",
      "Monday's lawsuit is the latest in an ongoing legal fight over what Fish and Game has cast as an effort to restore the Mulchatna caribou herd. The herd, named for its traditional calving ground, peaked in number at around 190,000 in the late 1990s and had provided an important source of food for subsistence hunters from dozens of communities. But the herd's numbers began falling, down to about 13,000 caribou by 2019, and hunting has not been allowed since 2021, according to the department.",
      "The department has said that factors such as disease, hunting, food availability and quality, and predation can affect caribou survival, and in this case, the board determined it could address predation. It said it's responding to requests to help rebuild the herd and restore the caribou as a food source for the region.",
      "In a fall newsletter, the department said bears and wolves \u201chave been identified as significant calf predators.\u201d It said an aerial survey last fall indicated the ratio of calves to cows in the herd's western subgroup was the highest recorded since 1999. It said this suggested a \u201cpositive response\u201d to its 2023 and 2024 predator control program targeting bears and wolves on calving grounds.",
      "According to the lawsuit, in May 2023 the agency killed \u201cevery single brown and black bear it found within the 1,200-square-mile (3,108-square-kilometer) focus area encompassing the western Mulchatna caribou herd calving grounds.\" Altogether, in 2023 and 2024, 180 bears, most brown bears, were killed, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Alaska Wildlife Alliance previously sued to end the program. In that case, a judge in March found fault with the process in which it was adopted and concluded the state lacked data on bear sustainability in the region before implementing the program.",
      "But the board and department pushed ahead, implementing emergency regulations under which 11 bears were killed before those were struck down by another judge.",

      "\u201cWe were trying to rebuild the caribou herd, but we\u2019re not going to jeopardize long-term sustainability of bears in so doing,\u201d the department\u2019s commissioner, Doug Vincent-Lang, said in a statement after the board's action.",
      "He said there was \u201cstrong evidence that neither disease nor nutrition are preventing this herd from recovering,\" and that predation \u201chas been isolated as the limiting factor preventing the herd from growing.\u201d",
      "Nicole Schmitt, executive director of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, said the program \"threatens bears who move across vast stretches of public lands.\u201d",
      "Schmitt in a statement Monday said sections of the area in which bears can be killed are near Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from Katmai National Park and Preserve and near wildlife refuges.",
      "Michelle Sinnott, staff attorney with Trustees for Alaska, called the program unconstitutional. She said it \"hands Fish and Game a blank check to destroy bears across an entire region with impunity. The Board of Game has once again shirked its constitutional obligations and ignored prior court decisions in its unscientific and relentless war on predator animals.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has made a public effort of blunting the impact on active duty service members by moving money around to ensure they have received two paychecks since the shutdown began on Oct. 1.

I just can\u2019t get you ready for the next exercise because now, probably, the exercise has been changed entirely,\u201d Hashem said.",

      "Hashem and McGinn said they also worry about the impact the shutdown will have on morale and retention. McGinn said the technicians especially feel \u201ccompletely demoralized\u201d and \u201cbetrayed by the government.\u201d",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee death row inmate Harold Wayne Nichols on Monday declined to choose between the electric chair and lethal injection for his Dec. 11 execution, meaning the state will default to lethal injection.",
      "Nichols was sentenced to death in 1990 after he was convicted of raping and murdering Karen Pulley, a 21-year-old student at Chattanooga State University, two years earlier. He has two weeks to change his mind about choosing which method will be used, Tennessee Department of Correction spokesperson Dorinda Carter said in an email.",
      "He was scheduled to be executed in 2020, and had chosen the electric chair, but was then given a reprieve due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tennessee inmates who were convicted of crimes before January 1999 are permitted to choose electrocution over the state's preferred method of lethal injection. Although several states still permit the use of the electric chair, it has only been used five times in the past decade, all in Tennessee.",
      "At the time that Nichols selected electrocution, Tennessee's lethal injection protocol used three different drugs in series. It was a process that inmates' attorneys claimed was riddled with problems. Their concerns were shown to have merit in 2022, when Gov. Bill Lee paused executions, including a second execution date for Nichols. An independent review of the state's lethal injection process found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed in Tennessee since 2018 had been properly tested.",

      "U.S. government attorneys say they have cleared all the hurdles needed to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia",
      "GREENBELT, Md. -- U.S. government attorneys say they have cleared all the hurdles needed to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia and are asking a federal judge to dissolve an order blocking his deportation.",
      "Abrego Garcia's mistaken deportation to his home country of El Salvador earlier this year has helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration policies. His attorneys claim the administration is now manipulating the immigration system in order to punish him for successfully challenging that deportation.",
      "A motion from the government filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland late on Friday says officials have received assurances from Liberia that Abrego Garcia would not face persecution or torture there. Further, it says an immigration officer heard Abrego Garcia's claims that he feared deportation to the West African nation, but ruled against him.",
      "His attorneys argue in a separate Friday filing that Abrego Garcia has already designated Costa Rica as a country where he is willing to be deported. They claim the government now must send him there. The fact that officials continue to pursue deportation to other countries is evidence that the process is retaliatory and violates due process protections, they argue.",
      "Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, finding he faced danger there. But in March, he was deported to El Salvador anyway in what a government attorney later said was an administrative error. Facing pressure from the courts, the administration brought him back to the U.S. in June but has since been pursuing his deportation to a third country.",
      "Much of Abrego Garcia's argument against his deportation to Liberia hinges on due process claims. The government tries to tear down those claims, arguing that his due process rights are not the same as a U.S. citizen's. Because he entered the country illegally, he should be treated the same as someone who just crossed the border, they argue.",

      "As part of his due process rights, his attorneys also say he is entitled to have an immigration judge review the immigration officer's determination that Abrego Garcia is unlikely to be persecuted or tortured in Liberia. They argue the officer should have considered the fact that Liberia could re-deport Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. And they say the Liberian government has only agreed to accept him on a temporary basis.",
      "Government attorneys say they have assurances from Liberia that the Secretary of State deems sufficient. The court cannot second-guess that conclusion because that would mean intervening in foreign diplomacy, the domain of the executive branch, they argue.",
      "\u201cThis Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit Petitioner to be removed to Liberia,\u201d they state.",
      "Separately, Abrego Garcia faces human smuggling charges in federal court in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming the charges are the result of \u201cselective or vindictive prosecution.\u201d A hearing on that motion is set for December 8.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration made a $7.5 million payment to the government of Equatorial Guinea as it seeks to deport people to the West African country and draws closer to its heavily prosecuted leaders, according to the top Democratic senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a letter sent Monday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press that \u201cthis highly unusual payment \u2014 to one of the most corrupt governments in the world \u2014 raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "Shaheen said in her letter that the $7.5 million payment stood out because it would would \u201cfar exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last 8 years combined\u201d to the country.",
      "The payment, made from a fund for migration and refugee assistance, would be the first government-to-government transfer from that account, which was set up by Congress to respond to humanitarian crises. She questioned whether the payment was a permissible use of the money.",
      "The State Department declined to comment on the details of diplomatic communications, but said, \u201cImplementing the Trump Administration\u2019s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State. As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America\u2019s border security.\u201d",
      "As the Trump administration looks to Africa for further deportations, the payment raised questions about how it is enmeshing its deportation agenda with other foreign policy goals, as well as the international leaders it is willing to trust.",
      "The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens. Immigration advocacy groups have criticized the \u201cthird country\u201d policy as a reckless tactic that violates due process rights and can strand deportees in countries with long histories of human rights violations and corruption.",

      "\u201cThe defendant\u2019s brazen and violent conduct caused fear and terror in his victims,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a court filing ahead of his sentencing. Braun, they said, has continued to show that he is a \u201cserious danger to the community.\"",

      "Since returning to jail, she said, Braun has been meeting with a psychiatrist, gotten sober and worked to rebuild his faith and community support, talking with a rabbi twice a week and expressing remorse to him for his actions. Braun's conduct, she said, was driven by addiction.",
      "\u201cThe past seven months in custody have given Mr. Braun significant time to reflect on the very serious harm his behavior caused, and to take steps to ensure that he can be successful on supervision moving forward,\u201d Wozencroft wrote to the judge ahead of the hearing.",

Braun was freed from prison, but the rest of his sentence remained intact, including requirements that he pay a fine and stay out of trouble.",

The nanny testified in court that Braun\u2019s actions made her so uncomfortable that she locked herself in a bathroom, called her husband and asked him to notify police.",
      "In March, prosecutors said, Braun grabbed and threatened a fellow worshipper who asked him to be quiet during a synagogue service.

      "U.S. President Donald Trump says that the United States government will boycott the Group of 20 summit this month in South Africa over his claims that a white minority group in that country is being violently persecuted",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- U.S. President Donald Trump says that the United States government will boycott the Group of 20 summit this month in South Africa over his claims that a white minority group in that country is being violently persecuted.",
      "Trump announced Friday on Truth Social that no U.S. government official will attend the Nov. 22-23 summit in Johannesburg \u201cas long as these Human Rights abuses continue.\u201d It was his latest criticism of the Black-led South African government, which has been a regular target for Trump since he returned to office.",
      "In February, Trump issued an executive order stopping U.S. financial assistance to South Africa, citing its treatment of the Afrikaner white minority. The administration has also prioritized Afrikaners for refugee status in the U.S. and says they will be given most of the 7,500 places available this fiscal year.",
      "The South African government \u2014 and some Afrikaners themselves \u2014 say Trump's claims of persecution are baseless.",
      "Afrikaners are South Africans who are descended mainly from Dutch but also French and German colonial settlers who first came to the country in the 17th century.",
      "Afrikaners were at the heart of the apartheid system of white minority rule from 1948-1994, leading to decades of hostility between them and South Africa's Black majority. But Afrikaners are not a homogenous group, and some fought against apartheid. There are an estimated 2.7 million Afrikaners in South Africa\u2019s population of 62 million.",
      "Afrikaners themselves are divided over Trump's claims. Some say they face discrimination, but a group of leading Afrikaner business figures and academics said in an open letter last month that \u201cthe narrative that casts Afrikaners as victims of racial persecution in post-apartheid South Africa\u201d is misleading.",
      "Afrikaners' Dutch-derived language is widely spoken in South Africa and is an official language, while Afrikaners are represented in every aspect of society. Afrikaners are some of South Africa's richest entrepreneurs, some of its most successful sports stars, and also serve in government and are largely committed to South Africa's multiracial democracy.",
      "Trump said on Truth Social that Afrikaners \u201care being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated.\u201d The president's comments are in reference to a relatively small number of attacks on Afrikaner farmers that he and others claim are racially motivated.",
      "Trump has also pointed to a highly contentious law introduced by the South African government that allows land to be appropriated from private owners without compensation. Some Afrikaners fear that law is aimed at removing them from their land in favor of South Africa's poor Black majority. Many South Africans, including opposition parties, have criticized the law, but it hasn't led to land confiscations.",
      "The South African government said in response to Trump's Truth Social post that his claims were \"not substantiated by fact.\" It has said that Trump's monthslong criticism of South Africa over Afrikaners is a result of misinformation because it misses the context that Black farmers and farmworkers are also killed in rural attacks, which make up a tiny percentage of the high violent crime rates.",

      "\"We just met one day on the street, and there were a few kids on the street, and him and I just became really close friends, and we kind of had the same sense of humor. We just became pals, and we've been pals ever since,\" Escobedo said in a 2022 interview for Texas Tech University's Southwest Collection oral history archive, disclosing that he and Kimmel were huge fans of David Letterman as kids.",
      "Escobedo would grow up to become a professional musician, specializing in the saxophone, and touring with Earth, Wind and Fire's Phillip Bailey and Paula Abdul. He recorded with Marc Anthony, Tom Scott and Take Six. When Kimmel got his own ABC late-night talk show in 2003, he lobbied for Escobedo to lead the house band on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",

      "Escobedo's father is also a member of the Kimmel house band and plays tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, the father-son duo celebrated nearly two decades of performing on-screen together.",
      "\"Jimmy asked me, 'Who are we going to get in the band?' I said, 'Well, my normal guys,' and he knew my guys because he had been coming to see us and stuff before he was famous, just to come support me and whatever. I'd invite him to gigs, and if he didn't have anything to do he'd come check it out, so he knew my guys,\" Escobedo recounted in the 2022 interview. \"Then he just said, 'Hey, man, what about your dad? Wouldn't that be kind of cool?' I was like, 'That would be way cool.'\"",
      "In the 2022 interview, Escobedo said the bandleader job had one major benefit: family time.",
      "\"Touring and all that stuff is fun, but it's more of a young man's game. Touring, also, too, is not really conducive for family life.

      "Her representative, Michael Greene, told the AP that Kirkland died Tuesday morning at a Palm Springs hospice.",
      "Friends established a\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0account this fall for her medical care. They said she had fractured four bones in her neck, right wrist and left hip. While recovering, she also developed infections, requiring hospitalization and rehab.",
      "Kirkland acted in such films as \"The Way We Were\" with Barbra Streisand, \"Revenge\" with Kevin Costner, \"Cold Feet\" with Keith Carradine and Tom Waits, Ron Howard's \"EDtv,\" Oliver Stone's \"JFK,\" \"Heatwave\" with Cicely Tyson, \"High Stakes\" with Kathy Bates, \"Bruce Almighty\" with Jim Carrey and the 1991 TV movie \"The Haunted,\" about a family dealing with paranormal activity. She had a cameo in Mel Brooks' \"Blazing Saddles.\"",
      "Her biggest role was in 1987's \"Anna\" as a fading Czech movie star remaking her life in the United States and mentoring a younger actor, Paulina Porizkova. Kirkland won a Golden Globe and earned an Oscar nomination along with Cher in \"Moonstruck,\" Glenn Close in \"Fatal Attraction,\" Holly Hunter in \"Broadcast News\" and Meryl Streep in \"Ironweed.\" (The Oscar went to Cher.)",
      "\"Kirkland is one of those performers whose talent has been an open secret to her fellow actors but something of a mystery to the general public,\" a Los Angeles Times critic wrote in\u00a0her review for \"Anna.\" \"There should be no confusion about her identity after this blazing comet of a performance.\"",
      "Kirkland's small-screen acting credits include stints on \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Head Case\" and she was a series regular on the TV shows \"Valley of the Dolls\" and \"Charlie's Angels.\"",
      "Born in New York City, Kirkland's mother was a fashion editor at Vogue and Life magazine who encouraged her daughter to start modeling at age 5. Kirkland graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and studied with Philip Burton, Richard Burton's mentor, and Lee Strasberg, the master of the Method school of acting. An early breakout was appearing in Andy Warhol's \"13 Most Beautiful Women\" in 1964. She appeared naked as a kidnapped rape victim in Terrence McNally's off-Broadway \"Sweet Eros.\"",
      "Some of her early roles were Shakespeare, including the lovesick Helena in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" for New York Shakespeare Festival producer Joseph Papp and Miranda in an off-Broadway production of \"The Tempest.\"",
      "\"I don't think any actor can really call him or herself an actor unless he or she puts in time with Shakespeare,\" she told\u00a0the Los Angeles Times in 1991. \"It shows up, it always shows up in the work, at some point, whether it's just not being able to have breath control, or not being able to appreciate language as poetry and music, or not having the power that Shakespeare automatically instills you with when you take on one of his characters.\"",
      "Kirkland was a member of several New Age groups, taught Insight Transformational Seminars and was a longtime member of the affiliated Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, whose followers believe in soul transcendence.",
      "She reached a career nadir while riding nude on a pig in the 1969 film \"Futz,\" which\u00a0a Guardian reviewer\u00a0dubbed the worst film he had ever seen. \"It was about a man who fell in love with a pig, and even by the dismal standards of the era, it was dismal,\" he wrote.",
      "Kirkland was also known for disrobing for so many other roles and social causes that Time magazine dubbed her\u00a0\"the latter-day Isadora Duncan of nudothespianism.\"",

    "story": [
      "Billy Bob Thornton's irreverence mixes with his Southern charm like a good ol' whiskey sour. After all, he can deliver lines with a sincerity that is almost mocking. He even, with a wink and a nod, played a not-so-saintly St. Nick. Some saw that as a brave choice. He doesn't. \"A brave choice is to see someone being attacked in a park and go intervene; that's a brave choice,\" he said. \"It's not a brave choice to do some weird thing in the middle of a scene, you know what I mean?\"",

      "He did write his own story, and create his own character. \"Sling Blade\" (1996), which he wrote and directed, earned him an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay, and an Oscar nomination for best actor to boot.",
      "Asked if he thinks he'll go back to writing and directing, he replied, \"You know, I don't know that anybody wants to see what I have to say as a director or writer, 'cause all my stuff is based on Southern literature. And I don't think that those stories would really be relevant to anyone right now. So, I doubt I ever do it again.\"",
      "Letting go of things he loves isn't easy. We were stunned to find out he hasn't felt truly care-free since the short-lived TV show \"The Outsiders\" \u2013 more than 30 years ago. \u00a0\"I had no responsibility,\" he said. \"I was making $2,500 an episode. Never thought I'd see that kind of money. Then, my brother Jimmy died, and changed my life. He was my best friend.\"",
      "\"So, that's when you talk about carrying it around in your back pocket?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\"",
      "They both grew up playing in bands. To this day, Billy Bob still idolizes his brother's musical talent. \"He played every instrument, except drums,\" Thornton said. \"He looked like he had a disorder when he tried to play drums.\"",
      "Thornton never gave up his love of music. His band, The Boxmasters, has recorded 19 albums, and this past Summer they opened for The Who. \"We're just there to waste 45 minutes while they're getting ready, ya' know?\" he said. \"So hopefully the fans will be with us.\"",
      "He doesn't act his age, and in hindsight we probably shouldn't have asked about it.",
      "\"Any thoughts on turning 70?\" I said.",
      "\"What did you say\" Thornton replied, raising an eyebrow. \"But uh, no, You know what, it's so funny you're scared of every milestone. But this one actually did affect me in a way that I had to, you know, have a few meetings with myself late at night.\"",
      "In the end, what Billy Bob Thornton has found is that he and so many of his older contemporaries, including his friend Sam Elliott (who is still acting with him at 81), are still defined by their good work.",
      "\"We've all seen each other get older,\" Thornton said. \"And when I see that wisdom and see the respect that people have for them, it just kind of makes everything melt away somehow. I mean, I'm in a successful band and I'm in a successful show. Every day when I wake up, I just say I'm blessed. That's really it.\"",

    "summary": "She's been called \"the acting world's best-kept secret.\" But Oscar-nominee Jessie Buckley's latest role, playing the wife of William Shakespeare in \"Hamnet,\" may change that.",
    "story": [
      "She's been called \"the acting world's best-kept secret.\" But Jessie Buckley's latest role, in the film \"Hamnet,\" may change that. As Rolling Stone put it, people \"will be talking about Jessie Buckley's performance for years.\"",
      "Buckley plays the wife of William Shakespeare (portrayed by fellow Irish actor Paul Mescal). Adapted from Maggie O'Farrell's novel, it's a fictionalized tale about the death of Shakespeare's son, Hamnet. It imagines the tragedy inspired him to write \"Hamlet.\"",
      "\"I just knew I had to go somewhere mentally, emotionally,\" Buckley said of her work.",
      "I said, \"You have this fire inside you \u2013 that's what we see on film.\"",
      "\"I don't know, do you?\" she replied.",
      "\"I'd say so, in what I've seen, you see it!\"",
      "\"I have fire, but I tell you what 'Hamnet' gave me, which I also was looking for, was tenderness. And sometimes it's just as strong as fire.\"",
      "She said when she started shooting the more difficult scenes, like the death of her child, she told her husband she needed to go away for two weeks. So, Buckley came to Hampstead Heath, a vast green space in London, where she'd go swimming each morning. \"I just need to be in nature and start my day and wake up that way, and then go to the set and see what came out,\" she said.",
      "She says \"Hamnet\" director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (an Oscar-winner for \"Nomadland\") reminded her cinema is not just escapism. \"Our jobs as actors and the storytellers are to touch the most heightened expressions that are too hard to hold on our own,\" Buckley said. \"I get to incubate the bits of us, myself, the shadow bits.\"",
      "\"What are the shadow bits of you that came out for this role?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm not telling you!\" she laughed. \"You have to watch it and make up your own mind.\"",
      "\"The sacred flame of star quality\"",
      "Her breakthrough role was playing a single mom just out of prison in 2018's \"Wild Rose.\" Then, in 2022, Buckley got an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress in \"The Lost Daughter.\" Her other credits included \"I'm Thinking of Ending Things,\" \"Beast\" and \"Women Talking,\" and the TV series \"Fargo.\"",
      "She said, \"I never in a million years thought I'd make a film.\"",
      "Because? \"I didn't have a TV 'til I was 15,\" she said. \"And it was exotic, like, it was in Hollywood. It wasn't in Kerry.\"",
      "In rugged County Kerry, in Ireland's southeast, Buckley grew up in an artistic family, playing harp, clarinet and piano. She sang and did school productions. But it was the British talent show, \"I'd Do Anything,\" that put her on a bigger stage \u2013 and in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber. He praised her, saying, \"Jessie has the sacred flame of star quality.\"",
      "She lost that competition, but quickly landed theater roles. Her first Shakespeare performance was near the spot in London where Shakespeare's early plays were first performed, at the original Rose Playhouse, built in 1587.",
      "Shakespeare changed everything for her: \"I think before, I felt like music was the only way to contain what was kind of wanting to come out, and then Shakespeare's words and his worlds were so titanic that it just made me realize how powerful words could be,\" she said.",
      "Of acting opposite Mescal in \"Hamnet,\" Buckley said, \"I absolutely adore that man. And from our very first chemistry read \u2026\"",
      "\"Chemistry read is to make sure you have chemistry?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" she laughed. \"I mean, it would be really depressing if I didn't, wouldn't it? I'd be like the only woman in the world who failed to find chemistry with Paul Mescal!\"",
      "The 35-year-old actor says she also found chemistry with Christian Bale for her next film, in which she plays the bride of Frankenstein's monster. Directed by Maggie Gyllenhall, it's genre- and expectation-bending.\u00a0 \"It's punk, it is proper punk,\" Buckley said. \"I remember when I read it first, it was like being plugged into an electrical socket.\"",
      "I said, \"Maggie Gyllenhaal referred to you as kind of a wild animal.\"",
      "\"Hmm. Good,\" Buckley said.",
      "\"Do you think there's a truth to that?\"",
      "\"I have a lot of life in me!\"",
      "That life and vitality that we now see on film is the journey that brought Buckley to London as a teenager. At the time, she says, she was in a dark place. \"I had depression and I wasn't very well,\" she said. \"And I wanted a lot from life. I was really hungry for it. And I felt like there was no place for that. And I think that's when it imploded in on me, and when I got sick and lost myself, you know?\"",
      "\"How did your deal with it?\"",
      "\"I got help,\" she replied. \"I got therapy. Singing. I mean, I honestly think it's kind of saved me. Something wasn't alive then, let's just say, like it is now.\"",

      "People often discuss which Hollywood star might play them in a movie about their life. For legendary boxer Christy Martin, the actor turned out to be Sydney Sweeney. Sweeney transformed into \"Christy,\" which hits theaters on Nov. 7.",
      "Before Martin's story was told on the big screen, she sat down with \"48 Hours\" in 2020 to share her story.\u00a0An encore of \"Christy Martin \u2013 the Fight of her Life\"\u00a0airs Saturday, Nov. 8, at 9/8c on CBS and streams on Paramount+.",
      "Raised as a coal miner's daughter in a small town in West Virginia, to becoming a world championship boxer, Martin made headlines as a pioneer in women's boxing. But few knew of the personal battles she was facing outside the ring.",
      "In the episode, \"48 Hours\" details the story of Martin's struggles with identity, acceptance, drug addiction, and domestic violence at the hands of her former husband and trainer, Jim Martin. \"The same story that you guys got, Sydney puts out there for the people to see and to gain inspiration from,\" Martin recently told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Sweeney spent months preparing for the role, including intense boxing training to recreate Martin's actual fights. In addition to physical preparations, Sweeney told \"48 Hours\" about the research she did to play Christy. \"I mean, I had a lot to be able to pull from and go off of. She had her book, there was the '48 Hours' special \u2026 There were interviews and fight footage. So there was a lot I could prepare with before I met Christy, and then I had Christy in my corner, so I was able to ask her questions and have her by my side and be able to watch her.\"",
      "Martin requested the writers not to \"Hollywoodize\" her life as they scripted her story. Martin said writer Mirrah Foulkes responded, \"There's enough crazy s*** that's happened in your life, we don't have to.\"",
      "As her survival story continues to reach more people, Martin hopes it can help inspire others. \"We're showing a pathway to get out of a domestic violence situation. We're showing how important it is for parents, relatives, friends to be accepting of someone who's a little different ... But I'm the ultimate underdog \u2026 If you can believe it, you can achieve it. Dream big. My Dad used to tell me to dream big, and I think I did.\"",

      "\"If you're going to do science, why not discover something important?\" That, James Watson (April 6, 1928-Nov. 6, 2025) told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2003, was his motivation when, at age 23, he arrived at Cambridge University eager to take on the mysteries of DNA.",
      "A zoologist who'd just earned his Ph.D. in Chicago, Watson teamed up with the brilliant physicist Francis Crick, who was 12 years his senior. As Crick theorized, Watson built models, burning through idea after idea. \"You're obsessed,\" Watson explained. \"It's like being obsessed with a girl or something. You know, she's there, and you can't get her out of your mind.\"",
      "The team had competition, from researchers at King's College in London, and from Linus Pauling in America. When Maurice Wilkins at King's College showed him an X-ray of a DNA molecule, taken by colleague Rosalind Franklin, Watson saw the direction he had to go: a double helix.",
      "On Feb. 28, 1953, Watson and Crick walked into a pub off the Cambridge campus and announced that they'd discovered the secret to life. Their theory about the double-helix structure of DNA appeared in the British science journal Nature that April. In 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize for divining the structure of DNA \u2014 key to understanding how genetic material works. Their discovery opened the door to genetic engineering, gene therapy, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples, tracing family trees via DNA, and monoclonal antibodies.",
      "Beyond years spent at the California Institute of Technology and Harvard University (where he helped create their program for molecular biology), Watson later helped lead the human genome project, which accelerated genetic research. But while the birth of Dolly the sheep in 1996 suggested that the concept of cloning wasn't mere science fiction, Watson himself wasn't comfortable with the possibilities. \"You can just imagine 200 Meg Ryans in New York City. You know, it would be a mess,\" he said.",
      "In 2007 he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York after he was widely condemned for making racist remarks. He retired shortly after. His inflammatory tendencies were evident years before. In his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery, \"The Double Helix,\" Watson wrote, \"A goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.\"",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \"You have to avoid dumb people. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\""

    "story": [
      "The 68th Grammy Awards nominations are out, with Kendrick Lamar leading with nine nods.",
      "Following Lamar, Lady Gaga, Jack Antonoff and Canadian producer and songwriter Cirkut received seven nominations. Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter, Leon Thomas and Canadian audio engineer Serban Ghenea were all nominated in six categories.",
      "Music released between Aug. 31, 2024, and Aug. 30, 2025, was eligible for the 2026 Grammy nominations \u2014 meaning some notable recent winners, including Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift, were not eligible for nominations.",
      "The nominations include some historical firsts. For Lamar, \"GNX\" is his fifth consecutive studio album to be nominated for album of the year, something no other artist has ever done. It's the first time Lady Gaga has been nominated for song, record and album of the year simultaneously. Bad Bunny also became the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for song, record and album of the year in the same year, according to Variety.",
      "This year's awards include two new categories: best traditional country album and best album cover. The existing best country album category was renamed to best contemporary country album.",
      "The traditional country album category is \"a response to kind of more traditional sounding artists who may have felt a little overshadowed on the country charts,\" Christian Hoard, executive music editor for \"Rolling Stone,\" told CBS News.",
      "\"Folks like your Willie Nelsons or Margo Price. I think you might see someone like a Charley Crockett or a Zach Top,\" he said ahead of the reveal of the nominees. \"These are really, really good artists who have kind of more of a traditional Nashville sound, so it's a way to get some recognition for them.\"",
      "The award show will take place on Sunday, Feb. 1, in Los Angeles. It will air on CBS and Paramount+.",

      "New Delhi - Authorities in India's capital have urged elementary schools to hold classes online, banned construction and urged people to work from home as the annual plague of air pollution hit the \"severe\" category in a health warning system for the first time this season. For the first time, the toxic air has drawn protests against the government, and a warning for people with health issues to simply leave Delhi if they can.",
      "The severe designation indicates potentially serious health impacts for people with impaired immune systems, and negative affects even for healthy people, according to India's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).",
      "The emergency measures were announced after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) sharply rose to 425. An AQI between 400 and 450 is categorized as \"severe\" and, as a norm, requires authorities to implement emergency measures under the government's graded pollution response plan.",
      "Air quality in India's capital deteriorates sharply every year around this time due to a number of factors, including farm waste being burned off and seasonal climatic conditions \u2013 but activists say authorities have not done enough to contain the air pollution.",
      "In a first, hundreds of people protested against the bad air quality at Delhi's India Gate over the weekend.",
      "Several protesters wore gas masks as a symbolic act of protest and held up banners, including one that read: \"I miss breathing.\"",
      "Earlier this month, one of the city's top pulmonologists, Dr. Gopi Chand Khilnani, urged people with health problems who can afford to temporarily leave Delhi to do so.",
      "\"Everybody cannot afford to leave Delhi, because it is not simple, Khilnani told The Indian Express. \"But those who have chronic lung disease or chronic heart disease, those who are on oxygen, and those who have the opportunity and ability to go abroad or to less polluted places, I very safely advise them to leave Delhi for 6-8 weeks from now, so as to protect themselves from the distress of breathlessness, the requirement of oxygen, and so on and so forth.\"",
      "The toxic air is affecting the health of people of the city regardless of underlying health problems, with many Delhi residents complaining of breathing problems and eye irritation this week.",
      "\"Every breath in Delhi NCR [National Capital Region] today comes with a major health cost \u2014 we're seeing more patients struggling with breathlessness, asthma, and heart problems, especially among children, the elderly, and those with chronic diseases,\" Dr. Harshal Ramesh Salve, at the Centre for Community Medicine at the prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told a group of journalists on Monday.",
      "A recent report by the Lancet medical journal - Countdown on Health and Climate Change 2025 \u2013 carried a grim warning for India: The country recorded around 1.72 million deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2022, a staggering 38 percent rise since 2010.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-hormone-therapy-marty-makary-interview/",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 08:48:09 -0500",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary explains what went into the decision to drop the most serious warnings on hormone therapy for menopause.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will remove the \"black box\" warning labels on many hormone therapy drugs used for menopause and perimenopause symptoms \u2014 a major turnaround that's likely to encourage more women to seek treatment. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in an exclusive CBS News interview that the change ends a decades-long \"fear machine,\" and he called the demonization of menopause hormone therapy, also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), \"an American tragedy.\"",
      "\"With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there's no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,\" Makary told senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, explaining that studies show that menopause hormone therapy can reduce the risk of heart attacks, the leading cause of death in women.",
      "The products affected by this change include medicines containing both estrogen and progesterone, systemic estrogen and topical estrogen.",
      "The \"black box\" warning labels were based on what many experts now consider flawed research on HRT from more than 20 years ago. Part of the criticism is that back in 2002, researchers on the Women's Health Initiative study overstated the risks of breast cancer because the data focused on older women.",
      "More recent studies have shown the benefits outweigh the risk for many women if hormone therapy is used in the early years of menopause, before the age of 60.",
      "\"We now have a more nuanced understanding, and we want to put that fear machine in its proper context and let people know that there are tremendous long-term health benefits,\" Makary said.",
      "In addition to heart health, those benefits include lowering the risk of cognitive decline or Alzheimer's and preventing osteoporosis, a major factor in hip fractures.",
      "Hormone therapy can help ease menopause symptoms, which can be debilitating, taking both a mental and physical toll. There are a wide range of symptoms, including hot flashes, insomnia, night sweats, mood swings, joint pain, weight gain and more \u2014 with some experiencing more intense effects than others.",
      "Menopause typically occurs in a woman's late 40s or early 50s, when the ovaries produce less estrogen and menstruation stops. Perimenopause refers to the transitional years leading up to it.",
      "What studies say now",
      "Over the past two decades, fears about breast cancer led doctors to steer millions of women away from hormone therapy.",
      "\"It's an American tragedy. I do think it's one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine,\" Makary said, denouncing the \"groupthink\" among doctors in the wake of the 2002 study.",
      "As a result, he told CBS News, \"50 to 70 million women over the last 23 years have been denied the incredible, life-changing, life-saving benefits of hormone replacement therapy because of the dogma.\"",
      "Those millions, he said, included his own mother.",
      "\"She had gone through perimenopause right around that time, but [was] never offered this therapy,\" even though she was a good candidate for it. \"Well, she went on to have two different falls recently where she had bone fractures. \u2026 And I can't help but think if her bones had been stronger from hormone replacement therapy, she wouldn't have gone through that.\"",
      "Menopause significantly speeds bone loss and increases the risk of osteoporosis, according to the Endocrine Society, an international medical organization. The group says 1 in 2 postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a bone fracture during their lifetime, which can lead to a cascade of other health problems.",
      "Markary added he knows breast cancer is a sensitive topic that needs to be treated very carefully, but said no clinical trial has ever shown that hormone therapy increases a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer.",
      "One of the things scientists have learned, he said, is that hormone therapy is best started soon after a woman's body stops producing estrogen.",
      "\"Hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women needs to be started within 10 years of the onset of menopause or perimenopause, and generally, the rule of thumb is not to start it after age 60,\" Makary said. After around 60, aging and lack of estrogen mean blood vessels have begun to harden and narrow, raising the risk of stroke and heart attack; taking estrogen earlier can help prevent that.",
      "Women should discuss the best options with their doctor.",
      "\"Look, I'm a regulator. I don't want to tell people what to take. And I'm not prescribing anything,\" Makary said. \"But we want people to have the right information. And part of that is addressing this fear machine that has been going on for 23 years, that has been magnified by the FDA's 'black box' warning on estrogen products for perimenopausal women.\"",
      "Non-hormonal therapy treatments",
      "While hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, it is not suitable for everyone, especially women with a history of breast cancer.",
      "Earlier this month, the FDA approved a new, non-hormonal option called Lynkuet, known generically as elinzanetant. The drug is the second medication to directly target the brain pathways involved in body temperature control. The first, called Veozah, was approved in 2023.",
      "Despite how common menopause is, research funding to study it has historically been limited.",
      "Even medical education on the topic has been limited, Markary said.",
      "\"The general philosophy was, why are we teaching about this, about menopause? Because there's nothing we can do for it,\" he said. \"Well, that dogma, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of omission of menopause in medical education.\"",
      "But, with more women in the field, that's starting to change.",
      "\"It's been a male-dominated culture in the medical establishment, historically. Now, roughly half of our medical students at Johns Hopkins were women, and that's a trend nationwide,\" Markary said. \"And they're starting to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, this is something where women are coming to their doctors and they're not getting the right answer.'\"",

      "Excerpt from an advocacy speech given in 2015 by Carrie Salter-Richardson",
      "My father was diagnosed at the age of 36 with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. He had already lost his mother and two of his brothers. He and his younger brother were diagnosed about the same time, and for seven years, I watched my dad and my uncle slowly wither away. On August 22, 1996, my father turned 43. A friend drove me to the nursing home to take him balloons and wish him happy birthday. I struggled with my faith as a young teenager but on that day, I prayed to God for my father's death. I knew when I left there, it would be the last time I would see him alive, if that's what you want to call it. My dad died the next day.",
      "We didn't really speak about Alzheimer's again until 2009 when I got a call from a long-lost relative letting me know that my oldest cousin had been diagnosed and was already in a nursing home. He died two months later at the age of 37. After his death, we began to do some research and discovered DIAN or the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network. They helped us determine that our family carries the PSEN1 gene, and we enrolled in an observational study at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "As part of the study, we were offered genetic testing to determine if we carried the same gene mutation. My brother Bryan was the first to have the genetic test done. Bryan and I are 18 months apart. We've always been best friends. He was always the best at everything. He excelled at sports and performing arts. He was popular and outgoing and the funniest person I know. When I got the phone call that he had tested positive for the gene, a piece of me died.",
      "On December 4, 2012, I drove to UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) to hear my results. I remember sitting in a little room for what seemed like hours waiting for the doctor and genetic counselor. When the door finally opened, I knew my answer. It was written all over their faces. But to hear the words, \"It's not good news,\" took the wind out of me. I showed little emotion while the doctor was talking. I just nodded my head and thought about sitting in that nursing home with my dad. I thought about how I would tell my children. Would they too pray for my death? I knew there were many people waiting for my phone call and hoping for good news. I dreaded making those phone calls.",
      "For a few weeks, I let it consume me, felt sorry for myself, and spent a lot of time crying. But I knew there were three people who depended on me, so I decided to make a lifetime of heartache into a quest for hope. I joined a clinical trial through DIAN. I became a volunteer for the Walk to End Alzheimer's, which led me to become a congressional ambassador for the Alzheimer's Association. I've traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with representatives and senators, advocating for more federal funding for Alzheimer's. I've been to the Montgomery statehouse. I'm now the chair of the walk. I don't ever want my children to see me give up. I don't want them to feel hopeless.",
      "It is my hope that my story and the stories of others just like me will start a conversation and end the stigma that comes along with this disease. Just maybe I can bring a new face to Alzheimer's so people know that it can happen to anybody, not just the elderly. I don't know where my story will end. But I do know that I will never give up hope for a world without Alzheimer's.",
      "* * * * *",
      "In the spring of 2021, I spoke with Carrie and planned a trip to Montgomery, Alabama, to photograph her and her brother Bryan.",
      "Carrie told me, \"I was 15 when my dad died, but when he was diagnosed, I was only seven. I didn't understand. Nobody ever really tried to educate us about it. My dad was the last one to die of the kids that got it. After that, we didn't even think about it anymore. We just kind of went on with our lives as far as Alzheimer's was concerned.",
      "\"Growing up with my dad's illness \u2014 him and my youngest uncle are like Bryan and I, the same distance apart in age \u2014 they went through it together. Because we didn't understand the symptoms of the disease, we were really embarrassed by our dad. We didn't want our friends to be around him. We laughed at everything he did and said. It was silly. It's hard to look back and think the last years I had with my dad were me just being embarrassed by him. He played baseball in college. He played minor league baseball for the Phillies. He did a lot of great stuff, but all that we remember now is how his life ended in a nursing home. He weighed 70 pounds on a feeding tube in a nursing home.\"",
      "I asked Carrie how that experience informed her decision to become a vocal advocate and she replied, \"I didn't know how the reactions would be, putting it all out there. Trying to break that stigma. It really helped me heal from the devastation of the news. I think that it showed my kids that I'm not going to just lie down and cry and do nothing. I'm going to try to educate people. Of course, I'm not an expert on the disease at all, but I think the best thing I ever did was to sit down and talk with my kids, because it inspired my daughter Hannah to want to do something about it.",
      "\"My oldest daughter is a student at WashU. She's a sophomore. She is working as an undergrad in an Alzheimer's research lab right now. It's really awesome. She's actually my best friend. She's at school now, so it's hard.\"",
      "I asked, \"Does she give back to you with messages of encouragement or hope? What does she say back to you now that she's an adult?\"",
      "\"She just tells me that she's proud of me, and she'll tell me if I'm slipping up on stuff. She's kind of like a mama bear, but she's a nine-hour drive away. We FaceTime a lot. She calls me every day just to make sure I'm good.\"",
      "I asked Carrie, \"Do you talk to your brother (Bryan) about how you're feeling and how he's feeling?\"",
      "\"We just make jokes about it to each other, because I feel like we're the only ones that can joke about it. He's very witty. He comes up with some really funny stuff. We don't sit there and have deep discussions about it, because he doesn't think that he is symptomatic, and everybody else knows that he is, and I'm not going to tell him otherwise. We just kind of interact the same way we always have, which is by goofing off, joking around.\"",
      "\"Does Bryan have kids too?\"",
      "\"No. He's gay. He never had kids. I'm the only one that had children, which makes me feel very guilty. I do carry a lot of guilt for that, because now they all have a 50 percent chance of developing it as well.",
      "\"My mom would have you think I'm about halfway in my grave. She's a hard one to deal with. I give her a hard time, but Bryan does need the help, and she does help me with a lot of stuff too. If I get stressed, she'll do my healthcare and all the things that really frustrate me. For some reason, I get stressed out so easily. She'll do it. She'll fill it out for me. She's helpful, but then she's also overbearing. Maybe that's how all moms are. I don't know.",
      "\"I know the differences that are happening with me, and my kids definitely know. They mention it. I do get flustered a lot easier than I used to. I used to be able to manage a lot more things on my plate than I can manage now. Just little things. I try to write everything down in a planner, but then I forget to look at my planner. I do have bouts of crying spells, which is weird for me, because I've not done that before. I won't even know why I'm crying. I'm just crying.\"",

      "A few weeks later, I was able to photograph Bryan and Carrie together in the backyard of their mother Mary's house in Montgomery. A few years ago, Bryan was struggling to live on his own and had to move back home from Atlanta. Mary is now Bryan's primary care partner. She helps Bryan with life's daily tasks and helped secure him a job at a local nursery where he can still enjoy work but in a safe and caring environment. Carrie had told me ahead of time that, despite only being eighteen months older than her, Bryan's Alzheimer's is much more advanced, and he has trouble communicating.",
      "I asked Bryan and Carrie what they would tell someone who was newly diagnosed.",
      "Bryan looked at Carrie and blurted, \"You go first!\" Carrie laughed and responded, \"When you're first diagnosed, at that moment you think it's the end of the world and your whole life is crashing down. But it's the complete opposite. It's given me so much more courage and brought me to meet so many wonderful people.\"",
      "Bryan paused with a sigh and said, \"I'm bad at speaking. Sometimes I struggle at work. But I get through it. Pennies and nickels and stuff ... the register ... it drives me nuts! You know what I mean? If someone is trying to use a check I have to ask for help. I struggle every day at work. But I still like it. I'm not very good at the computer. I can't type really fast. Sometimes I lose my train of thought. I used to be the wittiest person in the room, but I feel like it's kind of dimming for me. But I can still pull some jokes out.\"",

      "Hannah Richardson was a sophomore in college when we met on the Washington University campus in St. Louis. I had previously interviewed and photographed her uncle Bryan (forty-one) and her mother Carrie (thirty-nine).",
      "I asked Hannah about her family and her journey as a young Alzheimer's advocate and now college student. Because Hannah was so young when her mom Carrie was first diagnosed, she had to face the stigma and stereotypes of people living with Alzheimer's very early.",
      "She told me, \"I've had multiple people in my life tell me that my mom is lying. I've had people, friends and classmates tell me that since my mom is so young, there's no way she could have Alzheimer's. To my face people have told me that, and it's so hard to deal with that. When that first happened, I was fourteen and my mom was already doing some advocacy work.",
      "\"I was just shocked that someone would even think that or say that to me. That pushed",
      "me to follow my mom and try to be more active in the advocacy realm and to educate people my age, I started volunteering with my mom, and I eventually started my own chapter of the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's at my high school. It was really empowering and it kind of pushed me to want to do more advocacy- and education-type work.",
      "\"It was such a surprise to see how little people actually knew about it, even into college.\" I asked Hannah to tell me about her mother and how she copes, and she told me, \"There have been moments where I feel so devastated and defeated by it that it literally breaks me down.",
      "\"My therapist said, 'It's like grief, like you've lost someone, but you haven't lost them yet, but you know it's coming.' To me, I feel that's even harder, because you're waiting, and also my mom has been asymptomatic.",
      "\"I don't think she's asymptomatic now. She still does. But in the last few years, I've started to see those little signs, and those little, subtle changes slowly happen. It was reality hitting me in the face.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are the little signs that you've been noticing, because your mother and your uncle Bryan present very differently?\"",
      "Hannah said, \"They definitely do. My mom was asymptomatic until probably about two years ago. She still tells people she's asymptomatic, because no doctor's told her she's neurologically symptomatic. She's not forgetting things. She's not having the same things my uncle is experiencing, but I still think she is, because behaviorally she's not the same person she was. When I was growing up, my mom loved to be very social. She was always around her friends. She played tennis. She had all these different friend groups that she spent time with. She cared a lot about her friends, and now she has no friends. She does not see anybody.",
      "\"Going to the store stresses her out. Me FaceTiming her on the phone gives her so much stress, and she gets overwhelmed by it. Any type of social interaction, if it's more than just someone talking to her in the kitchen, it's overwhelming to her, and she gets agitated and frustrated and just lashes out.",
      "\"Three or four years ago, that was not the case. If you try to bring that up to her, she's in full denial of it. It's really hard, because she's definitely interacting with other people very differently than she used to.",
      "\"When I go home and when I talk to her on the phone and I see these things, it's definitely really hard, because it's like my mom isn't who my mom used to be, and she doesn't even realize it or acknowledge it. I think that makes it even harder, because if you try to bring it up to her, she denies it and thinks that I'm just pulling it out of thin air, but I'm not, and other people see it too. It makes it a lot harder to acknowledge and deal with it. I think her way of coping is not acknowledging it and not grieving it or being upset about it and just not even trying to think about it happening.",
      "\"That's been hard, because I think that was part of why I didn't face reality for so long, because she just tried to help others and didn't act like it affected her. But it does. And it affects her and my siblings. I think it made it a harder journey in that sense, and I wish that she would acknowledge it more. I don't know how to change that, but it definitely makes it harder. I get sad about it and I get anxious about it. I worry for my future because I know that I have a 50 percent chance of having Alzheimer's. I don't want to lose her and lose my siblings. I don't want to die!",
      "\"I get anxious and sad, and I've never heard her talk about that. I've had to kind of cope with those emotions and go through that in my own way, because she wasn't there. I didn't see how she did it, and I didn't see how she was doing as something to relate to.\"",
      "I asked Hannah, \"How did your family's history with Alzheimer's influence your decision to study medicine?\"",
      "\"I saw how in the beginning my mom didn't just shut down when she got her diagnosis but",
      "tried to be active in the community and try to educate others. That was really inspiring to me, because she didn't just sit down and take it. I want to do that as well, because my mom's always been someone I've looked up to my entire life, and I just admire her strength.",
      "\"When I was in high school, I started going with my mom to her yearly visits at WashU and",
      "seeing what the doctors do. I told them I was really interested in science, and they'd let me go in during some of her scans. They'd tell me about the brain and stuff. It was really cool, and I really enjoyed it. These people are doing work that actually impacts people's lives, and that's something that I really want to do. I got really inspired and thought 'I want to go to WashU. I want to go into research. I want to do what these doctors are doing and help people.' I just focused on that a lot. It's also a way to cope with what my family is going through. I can do this, and it will help, and that will be something I can be doing that's proactive to help my family and other families and everyone in the Alzheimer's and dementia community.",
      "\"I think my wish is like everybody else's \u2014 I want there to be a cure or treatment, because it terrifies me to think that I could have this. It's the scariest thing I can think of, and I don't want it. All I can hope is that there's something that someone somewhere can figure out to stop this and stop people from dying from it. Stop people from having to go through it, and watching their loved ones go through it. Because I sure as hell don't want to watch my mom go through it, or my uncle, and I don't want to watch me go through it or my siblings. Knowing there's nothing right now, you just feel so hopeless and helpless. I think that's part of the reason why I want to go into research, because I don't want to feel helpless and hopeless. That is what scares me most in the entire world.\"",

      "The veterans who fought and defeated fascism during World War II, and those who supported the war effort on the home front, have been called \"The Greatest Generation.\" But David Nasaw, professor of history at the City University of New York, says that description may be misleading. His new book, titled \"The Wounded Generation\" (Penguin Press), examines the invisible psychic wounds experienced by service members that went undiagnosed or ill-treated, as they returned to a nation that had also changed following years of war.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Lesley Stahl's interview with David Nasaw on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 9!",
      "\"The Wounded Generation\" by David Nasaw",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "In its duration, geographical reach, and ferocity, World War II was unprecedented, and the effects on those who fought it and their loved ones at home, immeasurable. The veterans who returned home were not the ones who had left for war. \"They are very different now,\" wrote the GI cartoonist Bill Mauldin in Up Front, published in June 1945. \"Don't let anybody tell you they aren't. ... Some say the American soldier is the same clean-cut young man who left his home. \u2026 They are wrong.\"",
      "Most returning veterans found it difficult, if not impossible, to get a full night's sleep. Many were troubled by recurring nightmares and flashbacks. They were irritable, angry, plagued by uncontrollable rages, feelings of social isolation, and fears of places and events that evoked memories of the war, their proximity to death, and the dead left behind. Large numbers sought relief by drinking to excess, as they had during the war and while awaiting repatriation. Those who sought professional help were told that they suffered from nothing more than battle fatigue that time would cure. It did not. The true cause of their distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), would go undiagnosed and untreated for decades to come.",
      "Nearly 16.4 million Americans, 12 percent of the total population, 32 percent of males between eighteen and forty-five, served in the armed forces of the United States in World War II. They left behind four million spouses, two million children, and tens of millions of parents, siblings, lovers, friends, and neighbors. The book that follows is an account of the aftereffects that lived on in the bodies, hearts, and minds of those who fought, those who awaited their return, and the nation that had won the war but had now to readjust to peace.",
      "The war itself lasted nearly four years. The men and women who fought it on two oceans, in the air, and on the landmasses of Africa, Alaska, Asia, Europe, and the islands of the Pacific served an average of thirty-three months, three-quarters of them overseas for sixteen months on average, three times as long as their counterparts in World War I. Never before or since have so many been called away to war \u2014 and for so long.",
      "The brutality and carnage of a global war were brought home in graphic reports and visual images in the daily press, the weeklies, Hollywood films, and newsreels. The human costs were made manifest with the arrival stateside of troopships bearing cargoes of servicemen of no further use to the military. In 1943 alone, more than one million were sent home, half of them with disability discharges. The overall numbers were alarming, but more so the percentage of those disabled and discharged \u2014 40 percent for the army \u2014 with \"neuropsychiatric defects.\"",
      "Why had so many hale and hearty young men broken down? In 1948, three years after the cessation of hostilities, Dr. William Menninger, chief consultant in neuropsychiatry to the army surgeon general, explained that the higher incidence of psychological breakdowns in World War II as compared with World War I was due in large part to the fact that the second world war was \"a 'tougher' one as nearly three times as long; it was fought on a rapidly moving and shifting basis instead of on fixed lines; it required many amphibious landings; it was fought in every extreme of climate; the lethal devices were far more devastating and nerve-racking than ever before; and more men were kept away from home for longer periods.\"",
      "There was a great deal of truth in Menninger's analysis, but his explanation brought neither solace nor relief to those who returned home with PTSD symptoms that could not be treated because they were not understood \u2014 by the veterans, their families, and the doctors and psychiatrists from whom they sought help.",
      "The nation to which the veterans returned was not the one they had left behind. There were shortages of every conceivable consumer item: white shirts and men's suits; meat and maple syrup; beef, bread, and barley; cars, used and new; and, most critically, affordable housing. What was most troubling was the lingering, inescapable fear that a return to economic depression was just around the corner, that the layoff of millions of war workers and the discharge of millions more servicemen would lead to massive unemployment.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Nov 2025 09:22:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Washington University Medicine in St. Louis is conducting important research into treating early-onset Alzheimer's before symptoms arise.",
    "story": [
      "\"I just know that my brain's not right,\" said Carrie Richardson, 44. \"And so, I hate it. I just want it to be normal.\"",
      "At 41, Carrie developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The condition is caused by rare genetic mutations that essentially guarantee a person will develop the disease. Her mother, Mary Salter, of Montgomery, Alabama, knows the toll of the disease all too well. \"I've lost seven family members from the ages of 37 to 44,\" she said \u2026 including her son, Bryan, who died last year.",
      "Mary, Carrie, and Carrie's daughter Hannah have been coming to the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis to participate in some of the world's first clinical trials in Alzheimer's prevention. \"It's the least I can do to help,\" said Hannah. \"I feel like I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do it.\"",
      "Dr. Randy Bateman, who leads international clinical trials at WashU Medicine, said, \"Now we have a chance to change the course of the disease in a way we've never been able to do before.\"",
      "One reason for Bateman's optimism: For the first time, there's finally success treating mild Alzheimer's with medication that removes amyloid plaques \u2013 the protein deposits that build up on the outside of nerve cells in the brain, interfering with memory and thinking. These drugs have been shown to slow cognitive decline.",
      "\"People who had the plaques removed are 30 percent better than the people who didn't have the plaques removed,\" Bateman said. \"It doesn't stop the dementia. Dementia still continues, but at a slower rate.\"",
      "The point of the trials, Bateman said, is to study what happens when treatment is started even before Alzheimer's symptoms are evident: \"If you look at the people who are treated in these trials, the people who are at the earlier stages, the earlier stage you go, the better off they do. Some of them actually have been stable. And so, what this suggests is that timing is critically important.\"",
      "Within a particular family with early-onset Alzheimer's, symptoms usually start at about the same age, so researchers can figure out when to start treatment to try to prevent the disease. \"In these people, we have near-100-percent certainty they will get Alzheimer's disease dementia,\" Bateman said. \"And we know about when they're going to get it.\"",
      "Though these rare mutations account for less than one percent of Alzheimer's patients, the lessons learned about when to start treatment may apply to everyone.",
      "\"A death sentence\"",
      "Jake Heinrichs is a Broadway theater electrician from Brooklyn who carries one of the early-onset genes. The disease claimed his grandmother, uncle, father and brother, all within the same age range. \"Symptoms in the 40s and, and dying in 50s,\" he said.",
      "For Heinrichs growing up, the word Alzheimer's was \"a death sentence.\"",
      "He started getting treatment in Bateman's study in 2013. Though he's definitely getting an antibody called lecanemab now, for the first seven years, he did not know if he was receiving an antibody or placebo. \"I was at an age where I should have been showing signs,\" Heinrichs said, \"and I am now at an age that I should probably not even be alive.\"",
      "His wife is Broadway director Rachel Chavkin. She says over the past three years, he will occasionally repeat a question, but otherwise has shown no cognitive decline since she fell in love with him twenty years ago. \"Jake is now 51, which is the age that his father was when he died,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration's budget cuts have stopped or delayed millions of dollars in Alzheimer's research. The situation has already had an impact on Bateman's trials. \"It's a precarious time,\" he said. \"Research is not like building a building or painting a wall where you can start and then stop for a few years and then go back and resume what you were doing. It's much more like feeding a baby \u2026 if you stop doing that for a few weeks, it's irrecoverable.\"",
      "\"Let's double-down on this disease\"",
      "With federal research money threatened, philanthropist Bill Gates says the effect of decreasing investment delays any breakthrough. \"The data these young researchers have to consider different ideas is so much better than even five years ago,\" he said. \"So, this is the time where you think, wow, let's double-down on this disease.\"",
      "That's exactly what Gates is doing. The billionaire Microsoft co-founder is using his wealth and influence to bring together industry and government to tackle Alzheimer's. He's already personally invested more than $300 million. \"I'm going to stay very involved in this,\" he said.",
      "At a time of such possibility, uncertainty about funding is threatening momentum. \"It's quite up in the air,\" Gates said. \"If you talk to researchers, they're dealing with the uncertainty of, should they hire young people, or buy new equipment? And so, hopefully in the next several months, this gets resolved and, you know, that we can go full speed ahead.\"",
      "Gates has spent a considerable amount of his fortune to improve public health. And for him, it so happens Alzheimer's is personal. Bill Gates Sr., an attorney and philanthropist who died five years ago at the age of 94, also had Alzheimer's. \"He was lucky enough to have 24-hour care,\" said Gates. \"But there was no medicine, no, nothing that could bring his cognition back.\"",
      "Gates is supporting research to improve early diagnosis, treatment, and patient enrollment in trials. And \u2013 surprise \u2013 he sees a huge role for artificial intelligence. \"AI is going to impact everything we do,\" he said. \"The biology of the brain is so complex that AI's ability to take large amounts of data and find meaning in that data means that this research is going to go a lot faster.\"",
      "The early-onset clinical trials are expected to continue for at least another five years involving hundreds of people at 40 sites around the world. If successful, it could usher in routine screening for Alzheimer's with a simple blood test, just as we do now for high cholesterol and diabetes.",
      "Could people be tested now? Bateman said, \"Right now in medicine, we don't test people without symptoms, because the treatments aren't yet proven to work in people without symptoms.\"",
      "Finding effective treatments is a hot area of research, and may include giving cocktails of medications that target not only amyloid but other possible culprits, such as brain inflammation and a damaging nerve cell protein called tau.",
      "Bateman said, \"If this trial holds up and we can continue to demonstrate benefit year-after-year that these people are protected, then I actually think that will predict what's gonna happen in the near future in ongoing prevention trials: That they will be positive, they will work, they will give people years of dementia-free life.\"",
      "So, Jake Heinrichs undergoes regular MRIs, physicals, memory testing, spinal taps, and PET scans to monitor his brain function, and see if he can prevent an almost-certain genetic destiny.",
      "Four-year-old Sam Heinrichs is living proof of what can come from a belief in science \u2013 and a leap of faith.",
      "I asked Jake, \"What made you finally say, you know what, even though there's a 50-percent chance he might get the gene, we're going to go ahead and try to have a baby?\"",
      "\"Because I've been part of this study, and it seems to be effective,\" Jake replied. \"It gave me hope that the scourge of Alzheimer's is something that we're not going to fear in the future. Anything could happen. But right now, I have hope.\"",

    "story": [
      "Americans may soon be paying more for their favorite Italian pasta brands \u2014 or even have trouble finding imported spaghetti \u2014 as the Trump administration eyes a new import duty on 13 of Italy's largest pasta exporters.",
      "The proposal, published by the Commerce Department in September, would add a new 92% antidumping duty after a U.S. government probe\u00a0found\u00a0that some Italian pasta brands, including La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, were selling their products below U.S. market prices. Combined with the existing 15% tariff on European Union imports, the total duties on Italian-made pasta could rise to 107%.",
      "That would represent one of the Trump administration's highest import duty rates on any product, according to the Wall Street Journal, which earlier\u00a0reported\u00a0on the pasta dispute.",
      "If the anti-dumping duty goes into effect, the impact on American consumers would be substantial, according to Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru. Some Italian pasta makers may simply stop exporting their products to the U.S., while others might raise their prices, he added.",
      "\"You don't have enough domestic manufacturing to fill up those shelves,\" Lempert said. \"So you're going to walk into the pasta aisle and you're going to see it half empty.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS News, \"Italian pasta is not 'disappearing.'\"",
      "He added that the antidumping duty is a proposal and that it is not yet final. \"The pasta makers still have several months to continue participating in this review before this preliminary finding becomes finalized,\" he said.",
      "Yet some Italian pasta companies are preparing to pull out of U.S. stores as soon as January because of the threat of the new antidumping duty, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Which pasta brands could be affected?",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:45:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm.",
    "story": [
      "Would a 50-year mortgage make homeownership more affordable?",
      "The Trump administration is working on a plan for a mortgage term that spans five decades, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte confirmed this weekend, calling it \"a complete game changer\" and a \"potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now.\"",
      "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm. Experts say homebuyers who opt for the longer loan would see lower monthly payments but a dramatic increase in the total cost of the loan.",
      "\"Borrowers might be able to pay less monthly principal and interest, since the loan would be spread out over half a century,\" said NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. \"But the total interest paid over the life of the loan would be staggering, since even with a low rate, you're looking at 50 years' worth of interest.\"",
      "Take a homeowner who wants to buy a $400,000 home with a 10% down payment, requiring a $360,000 loan. Even if both 30- and 50-year loans carried the same 6.25% rate \u2014 which experts say is unlikely \u2014 borrowers choosing the longer term would save only about $250 a month, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS News.",
      "In reality, rates on 50-year mortgages would probably run higher than 30-year loans, meaning those monthly savings could shrink even further, he added.",
      "Yet total interest on that same 50-year loan would accrue to about $816,000, almost double the $438,000 in interest paid over a 30-year term, he calculated.",
      "At the same time, buyers with a 50-year mortgage would build equity far more slowly than those with shorter loans, Wood noted. That's because a larger share of early payments goes toward interest, leaving less to chip away at the principal.",
      "\"Paying down the loan over so much time could also mean building equity at an incredibly slow pace,\" she said.",
      "Addressing the affordability crisis",
      "The 50-year mortgage proposal aims to spur housing demand at a time when many Americans are priced out of the market by high mortgage rates and soaring home values, Berner noted.",
      "The typical homeowner now spends 39% of their income on housing, well above the 30% affordability threshold recommended by financial experts, according to Redfin.",
      "Mortgage rates have eased this year but remain above 6%, more than double the pandemic-era lows. Meanwhile, home prices, though slightly down from their peak, averaged $410,800 in the second quarter, about 25% higher than in early 2020, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "While 15-year mortgages are also available, most homebuyers opt for 30-year loans because the terms allow them to spread out payments over a longer timeframe, lowering monthly costs,\u00a0according to the personal finance website  Bankrate.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency said it is \"evaluating all options to address housing affordability,\" including making mortgages assumable or portable. A White House official added that \"President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans.\"",
      "What about the interest rate on a 50-year loan?",
      "A half-century mortgage would give Americans an even longer window to pay back their loan, but experts say the monthly savings would be relatively modest because interest rates for 50-year loans would likely be higher than for 30-year terms.",
      "That's because lenders view longer time frames as carrying higher risks of default, notes NerdWallet's Wood. Likewise, rates for 15-year mortgages are generally lower than for 30-year loans because lenders view the shorter timeframe as less risky.",
      "The typical 15-year loan today has an interest rate of about 5.6%, according to Bankrate, versus about 6.25% for the 30-year loan.",
      "Extending loan terms could lift buyer demand, but that might push home prices even higher unless more housing is built, Berner added \u2014 erasing any benefit from lower monthly payments.",
      "\"This is not the best way to solve housing affordability,\" Berner said.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the 50-year mortgage in a Fox News\u00a0interview\u00a0on Monday after host Laura Ingraham questioned the president over criticisms of the plan. Ingraham noted that some in his MAGA base argue the proposal would benefit banks while making it take longer for Americans to fully own their homes.",
      "\"It's not even a big deal,\" Mr. Trump said in response. \"You go from 40 to 50 years, and what it means is you pay something less.\"",

    "summary": "After Sonder said it was shutting down, one guest told CBS News he returned to his short-term rental to find his luggage in the hallway.",
    "story": [
      "Sonder, a short-term rental company and former Airbnb rival, abruptly went out of business after Marriott ended its licensing deal on Nov. 9 \u2014 leaving guests scrambling as they were told to vacate their rooms immediately, according to accounts shared with CBS News and on\u00a0social media.",
      "Paul Strack, 63, visiting Boston from Little Rock, Arkansas, told CBS News he received an email from Marriott on Sunday about his Sonder stay, but he initially mistook it for a scam. The email said that Marriott's agreement with Sonder had ended, and that \"we are unable to continue your reservation beyond today.\"",
      "\"[W]e are kindly requesting that you check out of the property as soon as you are able,\" the email read, according to a copy obtained by CBS News.",
      "Because he had mistaken it for spam, he ignored it. But on Monday, after exploring Boston and returning to the family's accommodation at the end of the day, Strack found his room's door wide open and his family's belongings packed up and left in a hallway.",
      "\"Even our dirty clothes and toiletries were packed up, and our laptops were in plastic bags,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Sonder on Monday said\u00a0it would wind down operations immediately, and that it expects to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy to liquidate its U.S. assets. The company describes itself as a global operator of \"premium, design-forward apartments and intimate boutique hotels serving the modern traveler\" that has faced financial challenges related to its agreement with Marriott, which the hotel chain terminated on Sunday.",
      "\"We are devastated to reach a point where a liquidation is the only viable path forward,\" Janice Sears, interim chief executive officer of Sonder said in a statement Monday. \"Unfortunately, our integration with Marriott International was substantially delayed due to unexpected challenges in aligning our technology frameworks, resulting in significant, unanticipated integration costs, as well as a sharp decline in revenue arising from Sonder's participation in Marriott's Bonvoy reservation system.\"",
      "\"We explored all viable alternatives to avoid this outcome, but we are left with no choice other than to proceed with an immediate wind-down of our operations and liquidation of our assets,\" she added.",
      "Strack, who said he'd booked Sonder residences in the past, and until recently had enjoyed the experiences, was frustrated by his subsequent interactions with Marriott personnel, which he called \"not helpful.\"",
      "Marriott did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on its communications with Sonder guests after ending the partnership.",
      "Marriott recommended he stay at a nearby property for the remainder of the family's stay, according to Strack, which he estimated would have cost around $700 a night.",
      "Ultimately, the family spent their final night in Boston in the room that they had been kicked out of.",

    "story": [
      "Wendy's plans to close hundreds of U.S. restaurants in the coming months as revenue and profits decline, with the company citing cutbacks by lower-income consumers that it expects will persist through year's end.",
      "On a Friday investor call, Ken Cook, Wendy's interim CEO, didn't disclose the exact number or locations of restaurants that it plans to shutter. But he said the Dublin, Ohio-based company is likely to close in the \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its 6,011 U.S locations, or roughly 300 store closures if it shuts 5% of its existing restaurants.",
      "Wendy's said the closures will start in the fourth quarter this year. Closing underperforming locations will improve traffic and profitability at its remaining U.S. restaurants, Cook added.",
      "Fast-food chains have been struggling to lift sales as lower-income consumers feel increasingly squeezed by rising food costs. Both Wendy's and McDonald's have introduced value meals to entice diners, but Cook said he doesn't expect the financial strain on these households to ease soon.",
      "\"We do see more pressure on the lower-income consumer,\" he said Friday. \"We continued to see that in [the third quarter] and we expect that to continue into the fourth.\"",
      "The new round of closures comes on top of the closure of 240 U.S. Wendy's locations in 2024. At the time, Wendy's said that many of the 55-year-old chain's restaurants are simply out of date.",
      "Cook became Wendy's CEO in July after the company's previous CEO, Kirk Tanner, left to become the president and CEO of Hershey Co.",
      "Cook said in some cases, Wendy's will make improvements to struggling stores, including adding technology or equipment. In other cases, it will transfer ownership to a different operator or close the restaurant altogether.",
      "\"When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective. The goal is to address and fix those restaurants,\" Cook said during a conference call with investors.",
      "In the first nine months of this year, Wendy's said its U.S. same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 4% compared to the same period last year. Wendy's revenue fell 2% to $1.63 billion in the same period, while its net income fell 6% to $138.6 million.",
      "Cook said $5 and $8 meal deals \u2014 which have been matched by McDonald's \u2014 have helped bring some traffic back to its U.S. stores. But Wendy's isn't doing a good job of bringing in new customers, Cook said, so the company plans to shift its marketing to emphasize its value and the freshness of its ingredients.",

    "story": [
      "An outbreak of botulism tied to ByHeart baby formula has made at least 15 infants sick in 12 states, a California health official said Monday. The company announced Tuesday that it is expanding its voluntary recall to include all products while the investigation continues.",
      "Nine cases of infant botulism type A have been confirmed, with results on six others pending, said Dr. Erica Pan, health officer for the California Department of Public Health. That's an increase from 13 cases in 10 states reported on Saturday.",
      "Federal and state officials are investigating the outbreak, which began in mid-August. No deaths have been reported.",
      "ByHeart, a maker of organic baby formula based in New York, initially recalled two lots of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula over the weekend. It has now expanded that recall to include all batches of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula cans and Anywhere Packs nationwide.",
      "\"The safety and well\u2011being of every infant who uses our formula is, and always will be, our highest priority,\" Mia Funt, co\u2011founder and president of ByHeart, said in a statement. \"This nationwide recall reflects our commitment to protecting babies and giving families clear, actionable information. Alongside this recall, we are conducting a comprehensive investigation to do our part to get the answers parents expect and deserve.\"",
      "\"Consumers in possession of this product should stop using it immediately,\" California officials said.",
      "Here's what to know about the outbreak and infant botulism",
      "The outbreak has sickened babies aged 2 weeks to 5 months since mid-August. The infants were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart powdered formula, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "California officials confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart baby formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that causes the toxin linked to the outbreak. The tests to confirm contamination involve injecting mice with the cultured bacterium and then waiting up to four days to see if they get sick.",
      "\"These mice got sick really quickly,\" Pan said in an interview.",
      "ByHeart officials called for testing of unopened cans of formula. \"Testing unopened cans will provide reliable evidence that will help bring clarity to families who are understandably concerned,\" the company said in a statement Monday.",
      "At least 84 babies in the U.S. have been treated for botulism since August, California officials said. That includes those confirmed to have been fed ByHeart formula. The FDA is investigating whether any of the others are also linked to the same baby formula.",
      "Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It is caused by a type of bacterium that produces a toxin in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis.",
      "Infants younger than 1 are particularly vulnerable to infection because their gut microbiomes are not developed enough to prevent the spores from germinating and producing the toxin. They can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey.",
      "Symptoms can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel \"floppy\" and can have problems swallowing or breathing.",
      "No known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, said Dr. Steven Abrams, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\"This would be extremely rare,\" he said.",
      "The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.",
      "BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators.",
      "All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said. The treatment is delivered in vials that cost $69,300 apiece, Pan said.",
      "There is little danger of infant formula shortages because of this outbreak. ByHeart, which was founded in 2016, accounts for an estimated 1% of national formula sales, according to the CDC. The company sells formula through its website and in retail stores nationwide.",
      "That's far different from the crises in late 2021 and 2022, when four infants were sickened by a different germ after consuming formula made by Abbott Nutrition. Two of the babies died. No direct link was found between the Abbott products and the infections caused by cronobacter sakazakii, but FDA officials closed the company's Michigan plant after contamination and other problems were detected.",
      "Abbott's recall involved top-selling brands of infant formula, triggering a massive nationwide shortage that lasted months.",
      "In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company's packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii, the germ at the heart of the Abbott crisis. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing \"areas that still require corrective actions.\"",
      "Federal health officials have vowed to overhaul the U.S. food supply and are taking a new look at infant formula.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has directed the FDA to review the nutrients and other ingredients in infant formula, which fills the bottles of millions of American babies.",
      "The effort, dubbed \"Operation Stork Speed,\" is the first deep look at the ingredients since 1998.",

      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Both deals represent a decrease in the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal from 2024, which was $58 for 10 people, according to a\u00a0report from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Frozen turkeys that year accounted for a large share of Americans' holiday grocery bill, at an average retail cost of $25 for a 16-pound bird.",
      "Despite the surge in wholesale turkey prices in 2025, Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u00a0 doesn't expect consumer prices to increase much.",
      "\"We see that uptick right now in the wholesale price by about 40%, so we'll definitely see some price increases there, but I don't think they're going to go a whole lot higher above where they are at,\" he said on a Farm Bureau podcast.",
      "\"Higher wholesale prices for turkeys are likely to translate into somewhat higher prices at the grocery store, but the increase consumers see will probably be smaller than what's happening upstream,\" Ortega explained.",
      "In other welcome news for shoppers, CBS News' price tracker shows that prices for Thanksgiving dinner ingredients like butter, milk and potatoes haven't budged much compared with prices the same time last year.",

      "It's still unclear when the shutdown might end, though the Senate is working to finalize a funding package. House members were told late Sunday to expect votes on government funding this week, pending final passage of the funding measure in the Senate.",
      "Once a funding bill passes and the government reopens, federal workers are\u00a0entitled to back pay\u00a0under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019. The law covers both furloughed employees and those required to work without pay, requiring agencies to issue retroactive payments as soon as possible rather than waiting for scheduled pay dates.",
      "As the shutdown stretches on, the financial toll on federal workers has deepened, with some turning to\u00a0bank loans to cover bills. About 1.4 million employees\u00a0missed their first full paychecks\u00a0on Oct. 24 after receiving only partial pay on Oct. 10.",

      "When will workers be paid?",
      "Under the 2019 law, workers who miss paychecks during a lapse in federal funding must be paid retroactively as soon as the shutdown ends. It directs agencies to issue back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump on Sunday floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote Sunday in a\u00a0Truth Social post. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how the administration would disburse the checks.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Sunday told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending ew tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday ordered MD-11 and MD-11F aircrafts to be grounded as authorities investigate the deadly UPS plane crash in Kentucky.",
      "The emergency airworthiness directive came after UPS and FedEx said they are voluntarily grounding their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo planes \"out of an abundance of caution\" following a deadly crash at the UPS global aviation hub in Louisville.",
      "The FAA's order was issued \"because the agency has determined the unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design,\" the document obtained by CBS News read.",
      "\"We are assessing any potential safety issues and will ensure appropriate corrective actions are taken,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The crash on Tuesday at UPS Worldport killed 14 people, including the three pilots on the MD-11 that was headed for Honolulu. National Transportation Safety Board official Todd Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane\u00a0was a\u00a01991 McDonnell Douglas 2 that had been \"altered\" into a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Freighter.",
      "MD-11 aircrafts make up about 9% of of the UPS airline fleet and 4% of the FedEx fleet, the companies said.",
      "\"We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,\" a UPS statement said late Friday. \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"",
      "FedEx said in an email that it will be grounding the aircrafts while it conducts \"a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer.\"",
      "The planes were built by McDonnell Douglas, but the company merged with Boeing in 1997, making Boeing the manufacturer of record for the aircraft. Boeing told CBS News in a statement that it made the recommendation to ground the aircraft \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "Boeing's Safety Review Board assessed all available information about the crash and determined that further engineering analysis was needed, a company spokesperson told CBS News via email. The manufacturer recommended pausing fleet operations while that analysis was conducted. Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane was currently being \"handled\" by Boeing.",
      "Boeing announced in 1998 that it would be phasing out its MD-11 jetliner production, with final deliveries due in 2000. There are about 70 MD-11 planes in operation today. The planes are only used to ferry cargo. FedEx and UPS each have about two dozen MD-11s, and a third airline, Western Global, has 16. Twelve of those planes were already put in storage, according to the aviation analytics firm Cirium. CBS News reached out to Western Global for comment on the grounding.",
      "Flight records suggest the UPS MD-11 that crashed underwent maintenance while it was on the ground in San Antonio, Texas, for more than a month until mid-October. It is not clear what work was done.",
      "The UPS cargo plane was nearly airborne Tuesday when a bell sounded in the cockpit, Inman said during a briefing Friday. For the next 25 seconds, the bell rang and the pilots tried to control the aircraft as it barely lifted off the runway, its left wing ablaze and missing an engine, and then plowed into the ground in a spectacular fireball. The plane was carrying about 255,000 pounds of jet fuel, as well as up to 20,000 packages.",
      "The cockpit voice recorder captured the bell, which sounded about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, Inman said. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.",
      "Inman said it would be months before a transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.",
      "\"It occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,\" Guzzetti told The Associated Press after Inman's news conference. \"They were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. \u2026 They'll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.\"",
      "Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles. Witnesses recalled chaos on the ground.",
      "\"It was explosion after explosion after explosion, so you just didn't know when it was going to stop,\" Georgie Dow, the chief financial officer of an auto parts business that was struck by the plane, told CBS News. \"It was so hot ... You took a step back because it was like heat in your face. There was no going to help.\"",
      "The UPS package handling facility in Louisville is the company's largest. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.",
      "UPS Worldport operations resumed Wednesday night with its Next Day Air, or night sort, operation, spokesperson Jim Mayer said.",

    "summary": "Workers looking to pick up extra cash working retail jobs this winter may be out of luck as stores pull back on hiring.",
    "story": [
      "Retailers are betting they can handle the holiday shopping rush with fewer additional workers.",
      "From Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, retail stores are expected to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, down from the 442,000 seasonal hires companies brought on last year, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization.",
      "That would mark the lowest level of seasonal retail hiring in 15 years, according to the NRF.",
      "At the same time, the organization expects holiday sales to hit a record, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time as spending rises between 3.7% to 4.2%.",
      "The decline in expected seasonal hiring comes as the broader labor market is showing signs of strain, with some businesses across the nation holding off on adding new workers. At the same time, layoffs are accelerating, with job cuts this year through October rising to their highest levels since 2020.",
      "The group's hiring expectations \"reflect the softening and slowing labor market,\" NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said in a Thursday press briefing.",
      "\"But nevertheless, we are confident that retailers will be prepared to meet consumers with the prices, with the goods, and the convenient savings and value they're looking for this holiday season,\" he added.",
      "Despite\u00a0diminished consumer sentiment, holiday spending is projected to hold up as shoppers continue to prioritize the season's celebrations over other purchases, he said.",
      "\"People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it and we think that's going to happen again this year,\" Mathews noted.",
      "To be sure, consumers are expressing concern about rising prices, with inflation ticking higher in recent months due partly to wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Retailers are handing some of those tariff costs to shoppers, with a Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis analysis finding that companies\u00a0passed\u00a0about one-third of the new import duties onto consumers from May through July.",
      "\"All signals are consumers continue to be concerned about inflation and rising prices,\" NRF senior economist Jack Kleinhenz said during the press briefing. \"Despite these concerns, I believe consumers are still willing to spend, even though their sentiment is at very low levels.\"",
      "While retailers are planning fewer seasonal hires this year, some have added additional staff in the past few years, which could help compensate, NRF economists added.",
      "\"You might see less hiring, but we are seeing less firing in the retail industry,\" Matthews said. \"Those two are running neck and neck.\"",
      "For example, Target said it's asking current retail employees if they want to pick up additional shifts during the holidays before adding new seasonal hires.",

    "summary": "Estimates of the economic hit from the U.S. government shutdown put the losses at up to $16 billion every week the impasse continues.",
    "story": [
      "With bipartisan congressional talks to end the U.S. government shutdown bogging down on Friday, the hit to the national economy is growing, experts said.",
      "\"Even if there is a reopening of the government in the next couple of weeks, you're going to see a visible and permanent loss of economic activity as a result of the government shutdown,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Estimates of the economic impact range from $7 billion to $16 billion per week, with the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, a U.S. government agency, forecasting a weekly loss of $15 billion. A recent CBS News\u00a0poll\u00a0found that 54% of Americans said they are \"very concerned\" about how the shutdown is affecting the economy.",
      "Here's where the shutdown, now on Day 38, is hitting the economy hardest.",
      "Federal workers",
      "Hundreds of thousands of government employees are going without pay during the shutdown, forcing many to take out loans or seek out temporary jobs to make ends meet.",
      "The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank,\u00a0estimates that at least 670,000 federal workers are furloughed and roughly 730,000 are working without pay.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency that provides analysis to lawmakers, said in a\u00a0letter\u00a0last month that the reduction in hours worked by furloughed federal employees alone could end up costing the economy $14 billion by year-end if the shutdown stretches to Thanksgiving.",
      "Although government workers are expected to receive back pay\u00a0once the stalemate ends, some employees are likely to start to pull back on spending, which could ripple through the economy, said Mark Zandi,\u00a0chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Consumers",
      "The interruption in food-stamp benefits during the shutdown for the more than 40 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is also temporarily sapping consumer spending, Zandi said.",
      "Spending could soon rebound after a federal judge\u00a0ordered\u00a0the Trump administration to provide full federal benefits to states by Friday. Still, the suspension of food stamps comes as many low- and middle-income Americans face other financial strains, including a spike in Affordable Care Act health insurance rates.",
      "\"There's all kinds of funding that's not getting paid out, and that will impact the ability and willingness of these households to spend,\" Zandi said.",
      "Small businesses",
      "One key sector of the economy feeling the pinch is small businesses, many of which rely on government loans and business from federal agencies to stay afloat.",
      "For example, the shutdown is preventing the Small Business Administration from distributing $170 million in federally guaranteed loans per day to hundreds of smaller employers, an agency spokesperson told CBS News. As of Wednesday, that amounted to a total loss of $4.5 billion in capital for more than 8,300 small businesses, according to SBA.",
      "Federal contractors",
      "The government employs millions of contract workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. However, that activity has stopped during the shutdown, depriving many private businesses of revenue.",
      "Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at Oxford Economics, said the investment advisory firm estimates that roughly $800 million in federal awards are at risk of disruption each week the shutdown drags on. Around 5.2 million federal contractor workers stand to be impacted, according to unofficial estimates, she added.",
      "\"A prolonged shutdown could significantly impact these individuals by impacting the cash flow for the contractors, potentially leading to furloughs, pay cuts or layoffs, with the risks greater for small business contractors,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "An Oxford Economics report this week noted that recent jobless claims data point to a rise in private-sector layoffs in states most exposed to the shutdown.",
      "Travel companies",
      "The travel industry is feeling the impact after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to cut thousands of flights across the U.S. starting Friday.",
      "As of Wednesday, the industry had already lost roughly $5 billion in travel spending, according to Erik Hansen, head of government relations at the U.S. Travel Association.",
      "\"The timing couldn't be worse-just weeks before the busiest travel period of the year,\" he said.",
      "Economic growth",
      "Overall, the government shutdown is expected to take a toll on U.S. gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services.",
      "The CBO estimates that the drag on economic activity from the government closure will reduce annualized GDP growth in the final three months of the year by 1 to 2 percentage points, depending on how long the shutdown lasts.",
      "While economists expect most of the decline in growth to be recovered when the government reopens and as spending and commercial activity ramp back up, the CBO forecasts a permanent economic loss of $7 billion to $14 billion. Still, that is a tiny fraction of the $30 trillion economy.",

      "Fifteen of those airports are included on the\u00a0list obtained by CBS News of airports that will be affected by the 10% cut in air traffic. Some major airports, including those in Las Vegas and Charlotte, were not included in the data.",
      "Delays were more significant in some areas than others. Staffing shortages and weather conditions compounded delays in New York City last week. From Oct. 28 to Monday, fewer than 65% of flights arrived on time into the area's three airports. More than 81% of flights landed on time at the airports in September.",
      "Seattle and Denver's airports, on the other hand, have had more flights arrive and depart on time over the same timeframe than in September.",
      "In the first few weeks of the shutdown, the percentage of flights arriving or departing on time had not dropped significantly at most of these airports, the data shows. But many airports experienced their worst days last week. About 43% of cancellations from the shutdown's start on Oct. 1 to Monday happened in the last week of that timeframe.",
      "More air traffic controllers have not been coming to work during the shutdown, with some opting to take on second jobs to make up for lost pay. On CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said controllers are \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",
      "The FAA has issued at least 125 ground delays or stops due to staffing issues since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, compared with 26 in September, according to a CBS News analysis of Air Traffic Control System Command Center Advisories. That doesn't include staffing delays at control towers not based at airports, which also manage air traffic.",
      "Before the decision to cut air travel by 10%, Duffy had warned delays and cancellations would get worse if the shutdown continued, and cautioned the FAA would consider closing some airspace.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" he said. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",
      "Travelers can view the FAA's advisories to see airports are affected by delays or closures.",

    "summary": "Travel pros are urging people to brace for flight disruptions as the FAA throttles back air traffic starting on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines and travel experts are warning that a move by federal authorities to throttle back the number of flights at 40 major airports starting on Friday could disrupt people's travel plans across the U.S.",
      "\"Even if you're flying out of an airport that doesn't have reductions, there will be a domino effect across the entire system,\" said aviation expert Julian Kheel, CEO of travel booking site Points Path, adding that passengers should prepare for \"significant flight disruptions.\"",
      "One airline chief executive urged customers to buy a second ticket from another airline in case one flight is scrapped \u2014 a workaround that some travelers could see as beyond their means.",
      "\"If you are headed to a wedding, funeral or something you must be somewhere for in the next few days \u2014 given the risk of flights [canceling] I would suggest passengers buy a backup ticket on another carrier that departs after the first ticket,\" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in an Instagram post on Thursday.",
      "\"Carriers like Frontier will be putting you on the next available flight but that may not be until after your event due to the scale of this disruption,\" he added.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Wednesday announced that air traffic in 40 \"high-volume\" airports would be reduced by 10% in the coming days to cope with shortages of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay amid the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "The flight restrictions are expected to be phased in starting Friday, with airlines reaching the full 10% mark by next week, two sources familiar with discussions between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and the airlines told CBS News.",
      "Some airports on the FAA's list for capacity cuts are already experiencing problems. Passengers flying out of Boston's\u00a0Logan Airport\u00a0on Thursday were starting to see flight delays and cancellations due to the shutdown, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "Airlines promise extra help \u2014 and refunds",
      "As the air capacity cuts loomed, major airlines vowed on Thursday to alert customers on flight issues, help people rebook their travel, and provide refunds or credit if their trips are disrupted.",
      "\"As schedule changes are made, we'll proactively reach out to customers who are impacted,\" American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The carrier also said that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason or who choose not to travel can change their flight or request a refund without penalty. American encouraged customers to stay up-to-date on their flight's status using its mobile app.",
      "The airline said that, from Nov. 7 to Nov. 10, it will trim its flight schedules by 4% at the 40 airports affected by the FAA capacity restrictions, the equivalent of about 220 flights canceled each day. That represents a small fraction of the 6,000 daily flights on those days, American noted.",
      "Southwest Airlines said it will notify customers if their flight is canceled and automatically rebook them on new flights. Customers who do not wish to be rebooked are eligible for refunds, provided they cancel a new itinerary arranged by Southwest at least 10 minutes before the new flight's departure, the airline told CBS News.",
      "Delta Air Lines also said it would allow customers to cancel flights without penalty between Nov. 7 and Nov. 9.",
      "Check before you head to the airport",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder of travel rewards site point.me, said travelers should be extra vigilant in monitoring communications from their airline before heading to the airport. \"Pay attention to updates from airlines. If you're not getting emails, call them.\"",
      "John Rose, chief risk and security officer at Altour, a travel management company, recommended that travelers use an airline's app to track inbound flights to anticipate any delays.",
      "\"The main thing to watch is that the flight is still going, that it's on time. That's a trick that's easy to do on the airline's app. See where your plane is coming from and if it has any problems,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Rose added that it's important to look beyond the airports where cuts are implemented for travel disruptions, given that shortages of air traffic controllers in airport towers could affect airspace outside of such regions.",
      "\"Recognize that even with the 10% cutback, other flights could be impacted beyond that, because we don't know where people are going to be calling in sick and having staffing shortages,\" he said.",
      "But don't check luggage",
      "Although travelers should avoid checking luggage, if possible, to minimize another potential hitch, Rose recommends packing essentials like medication and a change of clothes.",
      "\"Plan to be stuck somewhere for an extra day,\" he said.",
      "He noted that international flights might be less prone to disruptions, given that airlines typically operate fewer flights a day to foreign destinations.",
      "\"Historically, the last flights to cancel are international because they tend to only fly there once or twice a day, and if they put you on the next flight, it's in a day or two,\" he said.",
      "When to book a backup fare",
      "Travelers who are especially eager to avoid flight problems can get a backup ticket, Funk said.",
      "\"If you have critical travel you cannot miss, then another ticket on a different carrier is always a good play,\" she said. \"Every carrier will solve for these things differently, so get a ticket on another airline even if there's a connection.\"",
      "Unused tickets can be canceled within 24 hours of purchase, she noted, so it's a relatively risk-free move.",
      "\"If I had a trip scheduled in the next week that I didn't have to take, I would consider rescheduling it,\" said Kheel of Points Path. \"If you do have to take a trip, you can book multiple flights on different airlines to try and protect yourself.\"",
      "Despite the headaches for passengers, air travel remains safe during the closure of federal agencies, now on Day 37 and the longest\u00a0government shutdown in U.S. history, Rose added.",
      "\"People's safety is not being compromised. The FAA is not going to put travelers in a higher-risk situation because of this,\" he said.",

      "The plan, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history, would be delivered to Musk \u2014 the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $437 billion \u2014 if Tesla hits certain performance goals under his leadership. Meeting such targets would make him the world's first trillionaire.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 08:13:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A trend that started in the technology sector is spreading to other industries, with businesses cutting workers even as their profits expand.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year \u2014 the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy.",
      "The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a \"jobless boom.\" Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs.",
      "\"We've never seen anything like that\"",
      "\"This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook,\" Zhao told CBS News. \"It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well.\"",
      "At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted.",
      "\"You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine \u2014 profits are doing great,\" he said. \"We've never seen anything like that.\"",
      "For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as\u00a0\"no hire, no fire,\"\u00a0meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers.",
      "The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP.",
      "By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring.",
      "\"Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. \"While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP.\"",
      "Why unemployment isn't spiking",
      "The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available.",
      "Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said.",

      "Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies.",
      "Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword.",
      "\"These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up \u2014 it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs,\" he noted.",
      "But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said.",
      "\"People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'\" he said. \"I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'.\"",

    "story": [
      "Apple called out European officials in a heated letter shared with CBS News, arguing European Union regulations that forced the tech giant to allow smaller rivals into its App Store have made its platform less safe for consumers.",
      "Because of the changes, \"risks to users on our devices will inevitably increase,\" Apple Vice President Kyle Andeer says in a letter Thursday to the European Commission, the EU's executive body.",
      "Apple accuses the EU of having an \"enforcement agenda\" that seeks to \"undermine the security and privacy of iOS and iPadOS.\"",
      "It's the latest complaint from an American company about alleged overreach from the EU's powerful digital laws.",
      "The tensions have factored into U.S. trade negotiations. In August, President Trump\u00a0threatened higher tariffs on countries with tech rules he believes are discriminatory to U.S. companies. In an April op-ed, Mr. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused the EU of engaging in \"lawfare\" to \"target America's largest tech firms.\"",
      "In recent years, the EU passed two major laws governing online platforms. The Digital Services Act requires platforms to follow certain rules on illegal or harmful content and advertising to minors, and the Digital Markets Act is designed to promote online competition. Tech companies can face hefty fines for violating either law.",
      "Apple was fined 500 million euros in April for violating the EU's Digital Markets Act by allegedly restricting app developers from steering users toward alternatives to the App Store. Apple appealed the fine.",
      "Since then, the company has become more outspoken in claiming the EU rules have opened the door to financial scams, pornography, privacy issues, and other problems.",
      "In its new letter, Apple says the European Commission sent an inquiry in October that questioned whether the tech company had put in place measures to ensure a high level of safety for minors, under the Digital Services Act.",
      "Apple fired back that the EU's other major law \u2014 the Digital Markets Act \u2014 required it to allow developers to link out of their apps to websites and other apps \"with no meaningful guardrails.\"",
      "\"This exposes users to fraud and scams on those third-party platforms that we cannot control or even monitor\u2014even for apps distributed through the App Store,\" the letter says.",
      "It continues: \"Apple has repeatedly warned the Commission that its approach to enforcement of the DMA is reckless and even dangerous, and urged the Commission to address the new risks their approach to the DMA has created for consumers,\" referring to the acronym for the Digital Markets Act.",
      "The European Commission could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "American tech giants like Apple, Meta and Google have faced scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, with regulators accusing them of stifling competition.",
      "Beyond the fines in Europe, U.S. officials sued Apple last year, alleging the company has violated federal antitrust laws by imposing \"shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines.\" And Apple has been embroiled in a long-running dispute with Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, over App Store fees and policies.",
      "Apple has long argued that its App Store restrictions are necessary to protect users from privacy, viruses and scams, and the EU's new rules could expose users to security issues.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. health regulators sent warning letters Wednesday to 18 websites selling counterfeit or unapproved versions of Botox and similar injectable drugs commonly used to smooth wrinkles.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it was taking action after receiving reports of injuries in connection with the products, including what it said were symptoms of botulism.",
      "Botox is a diluted, purified form of botulinum, one of the most toxic substances in the world. The ingredient works by temporarily blocking nerve signals and causing muscles to relax. While most famously approved for cosmetic use, Botox is also approved in the U.S. for a number of medical conditions including muscle spasms, eye disorders and migraines.",
      "The FDA warning letters mostly went to cosmetics websites. In each case, the FDA said the companies were offering unofficial or mislabeled versions of Botox-like drugs that haven't been approved by the agency. In addition to the original drug, introduced by Allergan in 1989, the FDA has approved several competing versions.",
      "FDA-approved Botox drugs carry the agency's most serious warning, a boxed label alerting doctors and patients that the medications can cause serious or life-threatening side effects.",
      "In rare cases, the toxin can spread beyond the injection site to other parts of the body, paralyzing or weakening muscles needed for breathing and swallowing. Signs of botulism include difficulty swallowing or breathing, slurred speech and muscle weakness. Those symptoms can occur several hours after an injection.",
      "In a press release Wednesday, the FDA said patients should only receive the drugs from health professionals who are licensed and trained to administer them. Patients experiencing signs of botulism should \"seek immediate medical care,\" the agency noted.",

    "story": [
      "Despite President Trump's waves of pardons for allies and supporters who sought to overturn his 2020 election loss and his clemency for all Capitol riot defendants, at least one federal case with tethers to the 2020 election is still lingering.",
      "A federal judge in Houston will sentence Abigail Shry on Wednesday afternoon, after she pleaded guilty to phoning a vulgar, violent and racist threat to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in August 2023. The threat was made hours after Chutkan was assigned to oversee Mr. Trump's criminal case for allegedly conspiring to overturn his 2020 loss, of which Jan. 6 was a component.",
      "In charging documents, the Justice Department said Shry, 45, left a voicemail for Chutkan in which she threatened to kill anyone who \"went after President Trump.\"",
      "The document alleged Shry referred to Chutkan as a \"slave,\" used a racial epithet and made threats against a Texas Democratic congresswoman, \"all Democrats\" and the LGBTQ community.",
      "Shry's voice message also said, \"If Trump doesn't get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you, so tread lightly,\" according to the Justice Department's court filings.",
      "Investigators say they linked the message to Shry after determining her cell phone number was used to make the threatening call.",
      "Shry pleaded guilty in November 2024 to a federal charge of transmitting an interstate threat. Her sentencing hearing had been postponed multiple times before Wednesday's court date. Sentencing recommendations, which are frequently posted in public view on federal criminal case dockets, are not publicly listed in Shry's case.",
      "On the day of Shry's guilty plea, the Justice Department offered further details on its investigation, saying Shry admitted that she made the call and \"noted that she had no plans to travel anywhere to carry out anything she stated.\" But she also allegedly told investigators that \"if the congresswoman ever traveled to her city, then 'we need to worry.'\"",
      "Shry's case was one of a fast-rising number of threats made against federal judges in the past few years. Reports from the U.S. Marshals Service, which protects federal judges, said more than 560 threats have been investigated so far this year.\u00a0 That's more than all of 2024 and on pace to match or surpass 2023 levels.",
      "A federal judge had briefly ordered Shry to remain in pretrial detention in the case. In a May 2024 hearing, a Justice Department prosecutor argued, \"My greatest concern in this case is that she starts watching FOX News again, gets herself spun up, she goes out, she gets a case of beer, continues to get herself spun up. There's no way to gauge what's going to happen here, except to look at what she's done in the past six months.\"",
      "A federal judge later released Shry, under the condition that Shry not possess firearms or consume alcohol.",

      "On Monday night, dozens of mostly peaceful protesters gathered near the Turning Point event on the university's campus, and scuffles broke out between police and some protesters, videos of the demonstrations show. At one point, somebody threw smoke bombs, CBS News Bay Area reported.",
      "According to a statement from the Berkeley Police Department, two men were arrested on suspicion of fighting in public. One of those individuals was released after officers determined that a 25-year-old man had stolen his chain and he was attempting to get it back.",
      "Two other individuals were arrested by campus police for failing to comply with directions, a university spokesman said. One was a current student and the other had no affiliation with the university, according to a spokesperson. One 45-year-old man attending the event was hit by a glass bottle and transported to the hospital.",
      "In a statement, UC Berkeley said the school \"is conducting a full investigation\" and will cooperate with federal authorities to \"identify the outside agitators responsible for attempting to disrupt last night's TPUSA event.\"",
      "\"There is no place at UC Berkeley for attempts to use violence or intimidation to prevent lawful expression or chill free speech,\" the statement read.",

      "Harmeet Dhillon, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Justice Department, wrote on X that her division will investigate \"several issues of serious concern regarding campus and the local security\" on the school's campus.",
      "Bondi referenced antifa in her X post announcing the federal government's Berkeley investigation, writing: \"Antifa is an existential threat to our nation.\"",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order labeling antifa as a \"domestic terrorist organization\" and directed the federal government to use \"all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle\" illegal operations conducted by antifa.",
      "The label antifa, short for anti-fascist, is widely used to describe far-left and anarchist individuals, though the Congressional Research Service has described antifa as \"decentralized\" and without a \"unifying organizational structure or detailed ideology.\" Instead, the group wrote, antifa is a broadly defined movement that believes in anarchism, socialism and communism.",
      "Last month, for the first time ever, the Justice Department charged two Texas men with allegedly providing material support to antifa, referring to their involvement in a violent July Fourth attack at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Alvarado that injured a federal officer. The Justice Department alleged that the pair were part of an \"Antifa cell\" that plotted the attack with guns and explosives.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-analysis-the-voters-mamdani-added-to-the-democratic-coalition-in-new-york/",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 19:12:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani's mayoral campaign turned out lots of voters who didn't back Kamala Harris last year \u2014 they are ethnically diverse, younger and less affluent.",
    "story": [
      "One of the hallmarks of Zohran Mamdani's historic win in New York City was the big turnout that included lots of new voters. The city's expanded electorate saw far more young people cast votes than usual, as well as many voters who had not turned out in recent elections.",
      "As the Democratic Party discusses whether to focus on turning out its base or persuading those on the other side, CBS News dove deeper into the data on new Democratic voters in last week's election \u2014 specifically, people who didn't back them in 2024. This group differs demographically from voters who backed Kamala Harris in the presidential election. Mamdani's new voters are younger, more ethnically diverse, and less affluent \u2014 and they also voted in the off year for reasons distinct from those that drive consistent voters to the polls.",
      "How many voters did Mamdani bring into the fold?",
      "A closer look at the CBS News Voter Poll suggests that 15% of Mamdani's voters didn't back Harris last year, either because they preferred Donald Trump (5%), voted for a third-party candidate (3%) or just didn't vote for president (6%). Mayoral votes are still being counted, but that translates to about 60,000 Trump-to-Mamdani voters and another 70,000 Mamdani voters who sat out 2024.",
      "An even higher share of Mamdani-not-Harris voters were new mayoral voters. That is, half of them reported they had never voted in an election for mayor before.",
      "Queens stands out as the borough where the Mamdani campaign both flipped and activated the most voters. About one in 10 Mamdani voters backed Mr. Trump last year, and another 7% did not vote for president. Looking at the numbers another way, our polling suggests that 15% of Trump voters turning out in the mayoral election flipped to Mamdani.",
      "Demographic differences",
      "Mamdani-not-Harris voters look quite different from more consistent voters in a variety of ways:",
      "Mamdani benefited from strong youth support, but Mamdani-not-Harris voters are even younger than his other voters \u2014 two thirds of them were under the age of 45.Mamdani-not-Harris voters are less likely to have college degrees, and they tend to have lower family incomes (44% are under $50,000 annually).Mamdani-not-Harris voters are plurality Asian, while Harris-Mamdani voters are plurality White. And when it comes to religion, a 29% plurality of Mamdani-not-Harris voters are Muslim.",
      "Mamdani benefited from strong youth support, but Mamdani-not-Harris voters are even younger than his other voters \u2014 two thirds of them were under the age of 45.",
      "Mamdani-not-Harris voters are less likely to have college degrees, and they tend to have lower family incomes (44% are under $50,000 annually).",
      "Mamdani-not-Harris voters are plurality Asian, while Harris-Mamdani voters are plurality White. And when it comes to religion, a 29% plurality of Mamdani-not-Harris voters are Muslim.",
      "Attitudinal differences",
      "Along with being younger and more diverse, Mamdani-not-Harris voters look different in their general political views and how they came to decide their mayoral vote:",
      "Mamdani-not-Harris voters were much less likely to identify as Democrats \u2014 only half did \u2014 or as liberal on most political matters.While most disapprove of the job Mr. Trump is doing as president, the vast majority say he was not a factor in their vote for mayor. By contrast, most consistent Democratic voters say a reason for their vote was opposing Mr. Trump.Related to the socioeconomic differences we see, Mamdani-not-Harris voters are likelier to describe New York's economy in negative terms and somewhat likelier to say they are falling behind financially.Another difference that emerges is the salience of Israel as a voting issue: the majority of Mamdani-not-Harris voters said the candidates' positions on Israel were a major factor in their vote.And finally, Mamdani-not-Harris voters took longer to make up their mind about their choice for mayor. About four in 10 decided in the last month of the campaign. That is consistent with them being less partisan and ideologically committed than Mamdani's other supporters, the vast majority of whom decided on him before October.",

That is consistent with them being less partisan and ideologically committed than Mamdani's other supporters, the vast majority of whom decided on him before October.",
      "Jackson Heights is a good illustration of where Mamdani added plenty of these kinds of voters. This heavily Asian and Latino working-class neighborhood in Queens leans Democratic, but it's not as deeply blue as other pockets of the city. Harris carried it with 56% of the vote, but Mr. Trump still did better than expected last year.",
      "CBS News estimates suggest that Mamdani is on track to match Harris' support level here, despite the fact that many Democrats and Harris voters preferred Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's relative strength in the neighborhood therefore comes from flipping a non-trivial share of Trump voters, as well as a higher-than-expected turnout, featuring lots of 2024 non-voters and new mayoral voters.",
      "Further down the Northeast Corridor\u2026",
      "In summary, Mamdani-not-Harris voters are younger and more diverse, both ethnically and socioeconomically. And they appear to be less ideological and more focused on pocketbook issues than they are on Mr. Trump.",
      "While sizable and diverse, New York City's electorate obviously is not representative of voters nationwide. But the gubernatorial races further south in New Jersey and Virginia offer additional data points on the types of voters Democrats brought into the tent this year \u2014 and many of the same patterns emerge.",
      "Democrats Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia won in landslides, thanks both to high turnout in Democratic areas and some Trump voters flipping. And it was voters of color, specifically Latino voters, and younger voters who were the likeliest to flip. In New Jersey, for example, 18% of Latino Trump voters flipped to Sherrill this year, while only 5% of White Trump voters did so.",
      "Add to this group voters who backed this year's Democratic nominees but didn't turn out in 2024 and you see many of the same characteristics as we saw in New York: the Democrat-not-Harris voters tend to be younger, less partisan, less affluent, and more focused on the economy.",
      "These trends mirror CBS News polling that finds Mr. Trump's approval rating has declined the most with young people, people of color, and less politically engaged Americans. But despite mostly disapproving of the president, new Democratic voters across these states mostly said their vote was not about him. As Democrats chart a path forward, there is much to replicate from their electoral success last week. Whether their goal is persuading former GOP voters to cross over, or persuading those who are disengaged that turning out is worth it, a focus on bread-and-butter economic issues seems to be a winning recipe for ousting incumbents.",
      "This analysis relies on county- and precinct-level election results, demographic estimates, and survey data from the CBS News Voter Poll. The Voter Poll was conducted by SSRS, an independent research company, on behalf of CBS, ABC, CNN, Fox News, NBC, and the Associated Press. It combines data collected from verified registered voters online and by telephone, with in-person exit poll data collected on Election Day."

    "story": [
      "With Congress on the brink of a deal to end the government shutdown, the Supreme Court has agreed to let the political process play out and keep in place a brief pause of a federal court judge's ruling that ordered the Trump administration to fully fund SNAP benefits in November.",
      "About 42 million Americans rely on food aid from SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "On Friday, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson had granted a stay on behalf of the Court, blocking the lower court's order that the administration transfer some $4 billion from other food security programs to SNAP payments. That Supreme Court stay was set to expire late Tuesday night, but will now stay in place until 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday.",
      "The administration noted in its Supreme Court filing Monday that Congress appeared to be close to reaching a deal, which would make the entire case moot. It urged the Court to keep its pause in place \"to let the political process that is rapidly playing out reach its conclusion.\"",
      "Justice Jackson, who handles emergency orders from federal courts in the First Circuit, would have denied the request to extend her initial stay. No other justice noted a dissent to the full Court's order Tuesday night.",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0warned states\u00a0in late October that the food benefit payments would not go out for November because of the ongoing shutdown. A group of municipalities and nonprofit organizations sued, and a federal judge in Rhode Island\u00a0ordered the USDA\u00a0to tap into a contingency fund to cover the benefits, which the Trump administration appealed.",
      "A USDA official overseeing SNAP said in a court filing last week that benefits were expected to be\u00a0reduced by 35%\u00a0in November.",
      "The House of Representatives could vote as early as Wednesday on a Senate-passed funding bill that would end the now 42-day shutdown \u2014 the longest in U.S. history. Reopening the government would restart funding for SNAP,\u00a0 but it's not clear how quickly full payments would resume.",

    "story": [
      "At a party Monday night to celebrate Sergio Gor's swearing-in as President Trump's new U.S. ambassador to India, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials told party attendees stories about the top aide who until recently held one of the most powerful \u2014 if largely anonymous \u2014 roles in government.",
      "Gor served as director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, vetting and hiring thousands of officials to work in the Trump administration.",
      "Rubio recalled sitting in a London restaurant with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Gor during\u00a0President Trump's state visit in September.",
      "\"All of a sudden this guy walks in,\" Rubio recalled. \"I'm like, 'Oh my God, that's Mick Jagger.'\"",
      "The lead singer of the Rolling Stones sat down two tables away.",
      "\"And Sergio's like, 'I'm going go up to him. I'm going to get his picture,'\" Rubio said. \"I go, 'Don't go up to him.' I looked it up online immediately \u2014 he's not like an enormous fan of the president. So, I'm like, 'Sergio, this might be really bad. We're in the guy's country. He's a legend in this country. I mean, I don't know how he's going react.'\"",
      "Rubio said he gave Gor one instruction. \"'OK, whatever you do, don't mention me \u2014 he doesn't even know who I am. And if he knows who I am, it isn't because he likes me.'\"",
      "Gor approached Jagger and chatted with him, Rubio said. \"All of sudden I hear: 'Marco Rubio would love to meet you. He's sitting right over there.'\"",
      "Rubio said Gor introduced them, and Jagger \"couldn't have been nicer.\" And he said that's when it occurred to him that Gor was \"going to be a good ambassador.\"",
      "Gor's ascension to U.S. ambassador to India follows a career in Republican politics with stints at the Republican National Committee and Congress, where he worked for conservative lawmakers. More recently, Gor was the CEO of a publishing company and political organization with ties to the Trump family.",

      "Earlier Monday, the president made reference to friction Gor has had with some of his aides.",
      "\"Some people, when they don't like Sergio, they don't like him. But when they like him, they like him more than anybody. But most of them really are in the 'like' category.\"",
      "There were just enough \"likes\" in the Senate to confirm Gor to his new role along party lines earlier this month.",
      "Partygoers on Monday included Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. and Mr. Trump's White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.",

      "The ambassador from India, as well as ambassadors from Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyz Republic, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan were also in the crowd.",
      "Rubio said some U.S. ambassadors have a direct line to the president, and Gor will be among the few who do.",
      "\"When Ric was in Germany, he could call the president,\" Rubio said, referring to former U.S. Ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell, \"and when Sergio is in India, he can call the president. And that it's an enormous sign of respect to the country you're sending them to.\"",

It's actually highly suspicious. We honestly try to ignore those things \u2014 'Why has Sergio been in this country 18 times?'\"",
      "At the Vatican for Pope Leo's inaugural mass in May, Gor told Rubio: \"Oprah Winfrey's here.\"",

During the first week of the shutdown, Johnson said he would administer the oath \"as soon as she wants.\" But Johnson has also said that it would happen as soon as the House returns, that the delay was the result of a scheduling issue and that his decision to wait was \"following the precedent.\"",

      "The crown prince is set to visit the White House on Nov. 18, part of a long-planned trip to follow up on investment announcements made last May when Mr. Trump visited Saudi Arabia, the sources said.",
      "The White House visit is expected to include an Oval Office meeting and lunch, similar to the meetings the president has held with other world leaders in recent weeks. But the White House is also preparing for a black-tie dinner on the evening of Nov. 18 to fete bin Salman.",
      "An invitation obtained by CBS News says the Nov. 19 event at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts will be co-hosted by the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia and the U.S.-Saudi Business Council. The forum will \"explore new investment horizons across critical sectors, including energy, technology, financial services, infrastructure, and healthcare\" and will be a platform for \"exclusive business matchmaking,\" the invitation says.",
      "The event is seen as a follow-up to the $600 billion in Saudi investment bin Salman first announced in February, including what the White House said was the largest defense salein history. In May, Mr. Trump brought a number of high-profile business leaders with him to Saudi Arabia,\u00a0 including Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Palantir's Alex Karp, Citigroup's Jane Fraser, BlackRock's Larry Fink, Franklin Templeton Investments' Jenny Johnson, Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi, BDT & MSD Partners' Dina Powell McCormick and Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman.",

And the president's son-in-law and former top White House adviser, Jared Kushner, started a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received a reported $2 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund controlled by bin Salman.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A provision of the legislative package that would end the government shutdown allows senators to bring lawsuits if federal law enforcement seizes or subpoenas their data without notifying them, with potential damages of $500,000 for each violation.",
      "The language appears to allow GOP senators to sue over steps that the Justice Department took during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Trump related to the 2020 election. In October, Senate Republicans revealed an FBI document that showed investigators had obtained phone record data from eight senators and one congressman for calls they made in the days before and after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The records were obtained pursuant to a subpoena in 2023, and the new legislation covers alleged violations dating back to 2022.",
      "The revelation that their call records were obtained infuriated the lawmakers, who accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the Justice Department to target Republicans.",
      "\"The FBI's actions were an unconstitutional breach, and Attorney General Bondi and Director Patel need to hold accountable those involved in this serious wrongdoing,\" said GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said the Biden administration's actions were \"arguably worse than Watergate.\" A spokesperson for Grassley did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new legislation.",
      "The document said the FBI collected \"limited toll records,\" which include information about which numbers participated in a call and how long it lasted, but not the contents of the conversation themselves.",
      "In a letter to lawmakers on Oct. 21, attorneys for Smith defended his investigative steps as \"entirely lawful, proper and consistent with established Department of Justice policy.\"",
      "According to the indictment of President Trump in connection with the 2020 election, part of Smith's investigation into the Jan. 6 attack focused on Mr. Trump's alleged attempts to call senators and representatives to pressure them into delaying certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory. Smith's lawyers have said he is eager to testify publicly about the two Trump probes he oversaw.",
      "The language in the new legislation requires service providers to alert Senate offices and the Senate sergeant at arms if federal law enforcement requests senators' data, and says a court cannot delay the notification unless the senator is the target of a criminal investigation.",
      "The bill further states: \"Any Senator whose Senate data, or the Senate data of whose Senate office, has been acquired, subpoenaed, searched, accessed, or disclosed in violation of this section may bring a civil action against the United States if the violation was committed by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or of any Federal department or agency.\"",
      "The bill says senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation of the notification provisions, and it prevents the government from invoking several types of immunity to rebut the claims. Suits can be brought up to five years after a senator is first made aware of a violation, and allows senators to bring suits for any instances that occurred after January 2022. The FBI analyzed the senators' call records in 2023, meaning they could bring lawsuits under the legislation.",
      "The government can defend against a suit by asserting that a senator was a target of a criminal investigation and by showing that a required notification about the records being pursued was delayed under a court order.",
      "The lawmakers whose records were obtained in 2023, according to the FBI document, were Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.",

    "summary": "Over the weekend, top federal housing official Bill Pulte floated the idea of a 50-year mortgage with President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "A proposal for a 50-year mortgage wasn't fully vetted by top Trump administration officials and wasn't ready to be made public, sources told CBS News.",
      "Over the weekend, top federal housing official Bill Pulte floated the idea with President Trump, who then approved a Truth Social post.",
      "Some Trump officials this week vented their frustration with Pulte over the move. One source said Mr. Trump was lukewarm about the suggestion but announced it \"to get Pulte to shut up about it.\"",
      "Another source disputed the characterization of the president as tepid about the mortgage proposal, however, and said 40-year and 50-year mortgages had been discussed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett and others in the administration.",
      "Three sources said the Trump administration has been working on other ideas to promote affordability for Americans, including strategies to alleviate the housing crunch.",
      "The internal discussions on the longer-term loans were casual, and no final decisions had been made, the sources said.",
      "The 50-year mortgage idea came about when Pulte spoke to the president at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, two of the sources said. Politico reported earlier that White House officials were upset with Pulte, the head of the independent Federal Housing Finance Agency. The FHFA regulates Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks, which are tasked with providing liquidity to member institutions for home financing and community investment.",
      "After Pulte presented the suggestion, a sign was posted to Mr. Trump's Truth account with a banner at the top reading \"Great American Presidents\" over the portraits of two presidents side by side, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Trump himself. The words \"30-year mortgage\" appear over Roosevelt, while \"50-year mortgage\" appears over Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump approved the Truth Social post, and it went up at 1:10 p.m. Saturday. About half an hour later, Pulte shared Mr. Trump's post on X and added that \"we are indeed working on The 50 year Mortgage\u00a0 \u2014 a complete game changer.\" He also called it a \"potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now.\"",
      "No other details about the proposal have been released.",
      "Pulte didn't immediately comment.",
      "White House spokesman Davis Ingle said the president is committed to making home ownership easier by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply, and lowering costs. \"The White House and the entire Trump administration are appreciative of Mr. Pulte's efforts, and everyone is working together to implement the President's policies,\" Ingle said.",
      "The president defended the 50-year mortgage idea in an interview Monday night with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\"",
      "\"All it means is you pay less per month.You pay it over a longer period of time. It's not like a big factor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It might help a little bit.\"",
      "Analysts are still examining whether a 50-year mortgage would make homes more affordable for Americans. Some point out that while borrowers might pay a little less in monthly principal and interest \u2013 because the loan's duration is 20 years longer \u2013 the total cost for them would be much higher.",
      "\"The total interest paid over the life of the loan would be staggering, since even with a low rate, you're looking at 50 years' worth of interest,\" NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood told CBS News earlier this week in an email.",
      "At this point, typical homeowners spend 39% of their income on housing, well above the 30% affordability threshold recommended by financial experts, according to Redfin. Mortgage rates have eased this year but are still above 6%, about twice the pandemic-era lows. Home prices averaged $410,800 in the second quarter, about 25% higher than in early 2020, according to Federal Reserve data.",

    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri and North Carolina redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina is now the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms, following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their House maps, along with a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.",
      "The redistricting push began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats, which was approved by voters on Election Day by a 29-point margin.",
      "In Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map earlier this month to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, signed the legislation on Sunday. In October, North Carolina Republicans targeted a single Democratic district as well, passing a map that redraws the 1st Congressional District to make it lean more heavily Republican.",
      "Utah lawmakers also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans, but a judge in November threw out the GOP-controlled legislature's map and ordered one that will create a Democratic-leaning district in Salt Lake city.",
      "Challenges remain in all states. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create the new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Civil rights groups are also suing in Texas, claiming the maps are racially biased. Despite getting the seal of approval by voters in California, state Republicans filed a lawsuit against Prop 50 after Election Day.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, including Indiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "Utah redistricting",
      "Utah's redistricting is different from the other states' campaigns, starting with the fact that the state does not have any Democratic members of Congress. The redistricting push also wasn't kicked off by Mr. Trump and Republicans or in retaliation for moves by other states. Utah's 2025 redistricting was put in motion this summer when a judge ruled the current districts were in violation of a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature put forward four maps for public comment, and ultimately on Oct. 6 approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. The legislature proposed a map that will split Salt Lake County into two districts, which would make\u00a0Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But a district court judge in Utah on Nov. 10 rejected redistricting maps selected by the Republican-controlled legislature and instead instead selected a map that would create a Democratic-leaning congressional district in Salt Lake City. The map approved by the legislature \"does not comply with Utah law,\" wrote 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson in her opinion. She continued that \"based on the evidence presented,\" the Legislature map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "Utah currently has four representatives in Congress, all of whom are Republicans. Both senators are also Republicans.",

    "story": [
      "A legal watchdog group is pushing the state bars of Florida and Virginia to investigate Lindsey Halligan, a Trump appointee who is leading the prosecutions of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "The complaint from the Campaign for Accountability, which was submitted to the state bars on Tuesday, accuses Halligan of violating the Virginia State Bar's ethical rules for lawyers in her handling of the criminal charges against Comey and James, two longtime foes of President Trump.",
      "\"Ms. Halligan's actions appear to constitute an abuse of power and serve to undermine the integrity of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and erode public confidence in the legal profession and the fair administration of justice,\" the 17-page complaint reads.",
      "Comey was indicted in Virginia in September for allegedly lying to Congress, just days after Mr. Trump named Halligan \u2014 his former personal lawyer \u2014 as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Two weeks later, Halligan's office also secured an indictment against James for alleged bank fraud. Both Comey and James pleaded not guilty. Mr. Trump has lashed out against Comey and James for years, and publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into both of them in September.",
      "By seeking those indictments, the Campaign for Accountability alleges that Halligan violated the Virginia State Bar's rules banning lawyers from making false statements to a court and barring prosecutors from filing charges that aren't supported by probable cause.",
      "She's also accused of breaking rules that require lawyers to provide \"competent representation\" to clients, avoid making certain out-of-court statements and avoid any \"deliberately wrongful act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness to practice law.\"",
      "The complaint noted several portions of the Comey and James indictments that critics have pointed to as possible weaknesses.",
      "In particular, Comey was charged with lying to the Senate in 2020 when asked whether he'd authorized any FBI staffers to serve as anonymous sources in news reports about Hillary Clinton, but the staffer he was asked about during the Senate hearing is different from the one who was referenced in the indictment.",
      "And James was accused of falsely stating on mortgage forms that a house she bought in Virginia would be her second home, when it was actually used as a rental property. But the Campaign for Accountability argues the form cited in the indictment didn't actually bar the house from being rented out.",
      "The complaint also points to reports that other prosecutors and investigators were wary of charging Comey and James, including Erik Siebert, who led the Justice Department's outpost in the Eastern District of Virginia until he resigned under pressure and was replaced by Halligan.",
      "\"The evidence appears to demonstrate that, absent President Trump's intervention, neither Mr. Comey nor Ms. James would have been indicted,\" the complaint says.",
      "It continues: \"Ms. Halligan was well aware President Trump had installed her as Interim U.S. Attorney specifically to indict Mr. Comey and Ms. James and, within just a few days of joining the office, she did just that\u2014despite career officials having found the cases insupportable.\"",
      "The complaint also castigates Halligan for an alleged conversation that she had with legal journalist Anna Bower about the James case. Bower says that after she shared a New York Times article about the case, Halligan messaged her on the encrypted app Signal and accused her of \"jumping to conclusions\" and sharing \"biased\" information that was \"way off.\"",
      "This conversation, the Campaign for Accountability argues, may have run afoul of rules that ban lawyers from speaking out of court in a way that could hurt the fairness of a jury trial.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Halligan for comment.",
      "The Justice Department has not yet responded to a request for comment.",
      "The complaint asks the Virginia State Bar and the Florida Bar to launch investigations into Halligan and, if warranted, impose disciplinary consequences.",
      "It could be a while before the issue is resolved. The two states have different processes for reviewing bar complaints against lawyers, but in both cases, there are several layers of review by attorneys and committees before a lawyer would face discipline \u2014 which can range from a reprimand to suspension or loss of their law license. Both state bars say they receive thousands of complaints annually, most of which don't result in discipline.",
      "Other high-profile complaints against lawyers, including the ones that led to former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's disbarment in New York and D.C., have taken years to reach a formal conclusion.",
      "Halligan is the latest Trump-linked lawyer to come into the Campaign for Accountability's sights. The group has also filed bar complaints against Alina Habba and John Sarcone, the top federal prosecutors in New Jersey and the Northern District of New York, respectively. Both prosecutors were named to their roles on an interim basis, and have faced challenges to their appointments.",
      "Meanwhile, attorneys for both Comey and James have questioned Halligan's role in their clients' prosecutions. They argue Halligan was invalidly appointed to her role as interim U.S. attorney, and say the charges against the two Trump adversaries were driven by personal animus.",
      "And a magistrate judge accused the Justice Department of taking an \"indict first, investigate second\" approach to the Comey case last week.",
      "The Justice Department has defended Halligan.",
      "\"Our EDVA US Attorney Lindsey Halligan did an outstanding job,\" Bondi wrote on X shortly after Comey was charged. \"We will continue to fight for accountability, fairness, and the rule of law because the American people deserve nothing less.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump is seeking to wipe away a $5 million verdict won by E. Jean Carroll after two years of failed efforts to win a retrial in the case.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump asked the Supreme Court on Monday to review a New York civil jury's 2023 conclusion that he was liable for sexually abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "Mr. Trump is seeking to wipe away a $5 million verdict after two years of failed efforts to win a retrial of the federal case, calling Carroll's claims \"implausible\" and arguing testimony stretched \"credulity past the breaking point.\" He has since promised to challenge the case all the way to the nation's highest court.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied Mr. Trump's appeal in December 2024, and in June rejected a request for an en banc review, in which all the judges on the court consider the case.",
      "The Supreme Court is now his last hope of overturning the jury's unanimous verdict. The jury found that a preponderance of evidence supported Carroll's claim that Mr. Trump sexually abused her during a mid-1990s encounter in a New York City department store, sticking his fingers into her vagina.",
      "The jury rejected Carroll's claim that she was raped, though the trial judge, Lewis Kaplan, later wrote that the conclusion that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing Carroll by forcefully inserting his fingers was an \"implicit determination that Mr. Trump digitally raped her.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claims Kaplan \"erred\" in several evidentiary rulings that affected Mr. Trump's standing with the jury.",
      "His appeal calls Carroll's claims \"facially implausible, politically motivated allegations.\"",
      "A spokesman for his legal team tied the case to others pursued against Mr. Trump during the years between his presidencies.",
      "\"The American People stand with President Trump as they demand an immediate end to all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded travesty of the Carroll Hoaxes,\" the spokesman said. \"President Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he continues to focus on his mission to Make America Great Again.\"",
      "An attorney for Carroll did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Carroll's legal team received some of its funding from a nonprofit tied to a Democratic megadonor, but has said in legal filings Carroll was not involved in obtaining the outside funds, which they received nearly a year after she filed her first lawsuit. They've said the funding was irrelevant to her sexual abuse and defamation claims.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied Carroll's allegations since they first surfaced in 2019, when she went public with a book excerpt published in New York Magazine.",
      "He has also appealed a separate federal jury verdict in January 2024 that found him liable for making further defamatory statements\u00a0 against Carroll. Combined, the two juries awarded Carroll more than $88 million.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The outgoing director of the BBC addressed staff of the publicly-funded British national broadcaster in a call on Tuesday admitting mistakes were made but urging them to \"fight for our journalism\" after President Trump threatened to sue the corporation for $1 billion over a program it aired in 2024 about the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "\"I do hear everyone when we have to be very clear and stand up for our journalism. We are in a unique and precious organization, and I see the free press under pressure. I see the weaponization. I think we've got to fight for our journalism,\" Tim Davie said in the Tuesday call.",
      "Davie gave three main reasons for his decision to step down from his role, including the demanding nature of the job and the upcoming BBC Charter renewal process that will take place in the U.K.",
      "He also said: \"I think we did make a mistake and there was an editorial breach and some responsibility had to be taken. So putting that together, that's what made my decision.\"",
      "There was no direct mention of Mr. Trump's threat of legal action, but Davie said political pressures on the BBC from both the U.K. and abroad were \"challenging.\"",
      "In a letter to the BBC's legal team dated November 9, lawyers working for Mr. Trump alleged that the October 28, 2024 episode of the network's \"Panorama\" documentary program, called \"Trump: A Second Chance,\" which was produced by an external production company, sought to mislead viewers by editing together three separate sections of a speech made by Mr. Trump on Jan. 6.",
      "The letter claimed that the program \"has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\" and that it was defamatory under Florida law.",
      "It outlined demands by Mr. Trump that the BBC retract the documentary, issue an apology, and \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.\"",
      "The letter did not clarify what would be considered appropriate compensation, but it warned that if the BBC failed to comply with Mr. Trump's demands by Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern, Mr. Trump would file \"legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages. The BBC is on notice.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the BBC said Monday that it would \"review the letter and respond in due course.\"",
      "U.K. media lawyer Mark Stephens said it would be hard for Mr. Trump to sue the BBC in the United States.",
      "\"Panorama wasn't broadcast in the USA, and BBC iPlayer (the BBC's streaming platform) isn't available \u2026 so it's not clear that any U.S. court would have jurisdiction to hear the claim,\" Stephens said on the BBC's breakfast program.",
      "The Director General of the BBC, Tim Davie, and its CEO of news, Debora Turness, resigned Sunday amid criticism of the program.",
      "\"Overall, the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said in a letter to staff.",
      "Turness said the controversy around the Panorama episode about Mr. Trump had \"reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC \u2014 an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 06:14:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A Utah judge rejected a new congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers and adopted an alternate proposal creating a Democrat-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "story": [
      "Salt Lake City \u2014 A Utah judge on Monday rejected a new congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers, adopting an alternate proposal creating a Democrat-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Republicans hold all four of Utah's U.S. House seats and had advanced a map poised to protect them.",
      "Judge Dianna Gibson ruled just before a midnight deadline that the Legislature's new map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "She had ordered lawmakers to draw a map that complies with standards established by voters to ensure districts don't deliberately favor a party, a practice known as gerrymandering. If they failed, Gibson warned she may consider other maps submitted by plaintiffs in the lawsuit that led her to throw out Utah's existing map.",
      "Gibson ultimately selected a map drawn by plaintiffs, the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government. It keeps Salt Lake County almost entirely within one district, instead of dividing the heavily Democratic population center among all four districts, as was the case previously.",
      "The judge's ruling throws a curveball to Republicans in a state where they expected a clean sweep as they're working to add winnable seats elsewhere. Nationally, Democrats need to net three U.S. House seats next year to wrest control of the chamber from the GOP, which is trying to buck a historic pattern of the president's party losing seats in the midterms.",
      "The newly approved map gives Democrats a much stronger chance to flip a seat in a state that has not had a Democrat in Congress since early 2021.",
      "\"This is a win for every Utahn,\" said state House and Senate Democrats in a joint statement. \"We took an oath to serve the people of Utah, and fair representation is the truest measure of that promise.\"",
      "In August, Gibson struck down the Utah congressional map adopted after the 2020 census because the Legislature had circumvented anti-gerrymandering standards passed by voters.",
      "The ruling thrust Utah into a national redistricting battle as President Trump urged other Republican-led states to take up mid-decade redistricting to try to help the GOP retain control of the House in 2026. Some Democratic states are considering new maps of their own, with California voters approving a map last week that gives Democrats a shot at winning five more seats. Republicans are still ahead in the redistricting fight.",
      "Redistricting typically occurs once a decade after a census. There are no federal restrictions to redrawing districts mid-decade, but some states - more led by Democrats than Republicans - set their own limitations. The Utah ruling gives an unexpected boost to Democrats, who have fewer opportunities to gain seats through redistricting.",
      "If Gibson had instead approved the map drawn by lawmakers, all four districts would still lean Republican but two would have become slightly competitive for Democrats. Their proposal gambled on Republicans' ability to protect all four seats under much slimmer margins rather than creating a single-left leaning district.",
      "The ruling came minutes before midnight on the day the state's top election official said was the latest possible date to enact a new congressional map so county clerks would have enough time to prepare for candidate filings for the 2026 midterms.",
      "Republicans have argued Gibson doesn't have legal authority to enact a map that wasn't approved by the Legislature. State Rep. Matt MacPherson called the ruling a \"gross abuse of power\" and said he has opened a bill to pursue impeachment against Gibson.",
      "Gibson said in her ruling she has an obligation to ensure a lawful map is in place by the deadline.",
      "CBS Salt Lake City affiliate KUTV reports that Republicans have been holding meetings across Utah to push a ballot initiative to repeal Proposition 4, the law that created the state's Independent Redistricting Commission. Supporters of the repeal effort need to collect about 140,000 signatures to get the measure on the 2026 ballot, giving voters the final say on whether to keep or scrap the commission.",
      "Even if the Utah GOP is successful, Judge Gibson's ruling dictates Utah's congressional districts for the 2026 election cycle.",

    "story": [
      "You've seen the videos in newscasts and social feeds: Federal agents employing chokeholds, firing pepper spray at close range, and even using vehicle maneuvers to control immigration protests.",
      "These videos have spurred debate over whether agents have violated federal policies on use of force, which is authorized \"only when no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative appears to exist,\" according to Department of Homeland Security policies.",
      "A review of hundreds of videos, most recorded on cellphones by protesters and posted online, shows repeated instances that don't appear to meet that standard.",
      "We asked Eric Balliet, a career federal agent who worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations for more than two decades, to review some of the tactics used in these videos. Balliet led internal investigations into use of force misconduct for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement until last year.",
      "\"This isn't policing and law enforcement as I practiced it for 25 years,\" he said.",
      "Customs and Border Protection commander Gregory Bovino, who is leading the federal agents responding to protests in Chicago, disagrees.",
      "\"If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them,\" Bovino said in an interview with CBS News. \"Don't protest and don't trespass.\"",
      "Protesters and media organizations in Chicago have filed a complaint in federal court about the tactics employed under Bovino's command, as well as those captured on video recordings in Portland, Oregon; Los Angeles and other cities. Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Sara L. Ellis issued an order blocking federal agents from deploying chemical spray, tear gas or any other less-lethal weapon \"unless such force is necessary to stop the immediate threat of physical harm to another.\" The Trump administration has filed an appeal.",
      "DHS is now racing to file its implementation guidance in response to the judge's order. Revised directives informing DHS personnel of banned use-of-force tactics must be issued by the end of the day Tuesday.",
      "\"I see little reason for the use of force that the federal agents are currently using,\" Ellis said in her ruling from the bench.",
      "\"The use of force shocks the conscience,\" Ellis said.",
      "But President Trump said in an interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" earlier this month that the tactics employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"haven't gone far enough.\"",
      "\"I don't know where the leadership is here,\" said Balliet. \"It seems to be non-existent. Any oversight and justification for the use of force seems to be absent across the board.\"",
      "Balliet reviewed dozens of videos at the request of CBS News, and he identified several clear areas of concern with the tactics he saw in use against demonstrators.",
      "Firing less-than-lethal munitions at protesters' heads and torsos",
      "Videos taken outside the ICE facilities show federal agents standing several stories above protesters and shooting less-than-lethal munitions towards their heads and torsos.",
      "One cellphone video from September, taken outside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, shows a priest looking up toward agents standing several stories above him. In the video, agents fire pepper balls that land nearby him, and explode on the ground. One agent then fires a pepper ball that strikes the man in the head, and he crumbles to the ground.",
      "Agency policy prohibits agents from firing at anyone above the waist, stating they \"shall not intentionally target the head, neck, groin, or female breast.\"",
      "Balliet says such incidents show a lack of proper training.",
      "\"They are elevating the force to a degree that is excessive,\" Balliet said.",
      "During an interview, CBS News showed Bovino the September video and asked him if the agent had breached department policy. He said the agent had not \u2014 because the protesters were \"trespassing\" on federal grounds and the use of pepper balls didn't deviate from policy.",
      "\"The use of that less-lethal device, a pepper ball, was absolutely in line with policy. And I applaud them for protecting that federal facility there.\" He said use of force outside of the Broadview facility has been \"exemplary.\"",
      "Tear gas and pepper spray at close range",
      "Videos collected from Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles show agents deploying large amounts of tear gas and pepper spray at protesters, sometimes at close range.",
      "In one October cellphone video from Portland, a federal agent can be seen spraying a form of tear gas called \"oleoresin capsicum\" spray directly at an individual protester at close range and in high volume.",
      "The protester can be seen verbally confronting two agents in the street. Another agent then walks up to the protester and sprays her directly in the face with a large can of pepper spray.",
      "\"If you take direct shots to the eye, it can scratch or prick your cornea,\" said Balliet. In his experience, agents have gone to the emergency room for eye damage after being sprayed at similar ranges with this type of munition.",
      "DHS policy allows the deployment of chemical irritants only in cases when subjects offer \"active resistance.\" The footage shows protesters yelling but not physically threatening the agents, which Balliet said was not a sufficient provocation for this level of response.",
      "\"For this particular one, it's a little disturbing because there does not appear to be any sort of de-escalation attempt,\" Balliet said.",

      "Balliet says driving a vehicle into a protester constitutes \"deadly force,\" or what the DHS use of force policy defines as \"action that carries a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily injury.\"",
      "\"Anytime you introduce a vehicle into an already volatile situation, it drastically changes the dynamics,\" Balliet said. \"It rises into that deadly force arena.\"",
      "The fact that the vehicle was unmarked and the lack of communication created further risk, he said. A protester in the video can be heard saying, \"Who are you?\" as the car continues to push into the demonstrator.",
      "\"I can't stress enough the significance of markings,\" Balliet said. \"When you blur the line in that world, it presents a danger to everyone involved.\"",

      "But in two videos from Chicago, federal agents are seen putting their hands or arms directly around the necks of protesters during tense encounters. In one Broadview incident, agents surround a female protester who is attempting to block a car from leaving the facility. An agent, who is masked but not wearing a helmet, even as other agents fire pepperballs from an elevated location, puts his arm around her throat. Another officer then pulls the man off the woman and she is released.",
      "\"It's considered lethal force for a reason,\" Balliet said. \"If I were the commander, that individual would be off the team 30 seconds after it happened.\"",
      "In another Chicago video, a Border Patrol agent places his hands around the neck of a protester and slams him onto the ground. As the agent engages in the hands-on approach, he swings his rifle behind him, leaving the muzzle of his potentially loaded gun unprotected.",
      "\"The fact that that weapon, that M4, is just flailing around muzzling the agents, muzzling the crowd, is basically begging some bad actor to grab it,\" said Balliet. \"It's good that somebody didn't get extremely hurt or killed in this.\"",

      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said federal agents are \"trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate took a major\u00a0step toward ending the government shutdown late Monday by passing a funding bill that unlocks a broader agreement on long-term spending and the promise of a future vote on extending health care tax credits.",
      "The vote was 60-40, with eight Democrats providing the votes needed. One Republican voted against it.",
      "The eight Democrats had been engaged in bipartisan talks over ending the stalemate for several weeks, and reached the agreement without the support of the party's leaders in the upper chamber. The House could vote on the bill as early as Wednesday, and if it passes, it will go to President Trump's desk.",
      "The agreement they struck does nothing to address the expiring health care tax credits \u2014 which had been their party's key demand \u2014 besides the promise of a future vote on the issue. The deal left many Democrats furious with the eight senators who voted to advance it and with the party's leaders for allowing the defections.",
      "Here's what is in the agreement:",
      "Government funding extension until Jan. 30",
      "The final deal will include a 31-page continuing resolution that extends current levels of government funding through January 2026 to give lawmakers more time to finalize full-year spending bills.",
      "The House passed a continuing resolution to extend funding until Nov. 21 in September, but until Sunday the Senate was unable to advance it. With that deadline less than two weeks away, Senate negotiators determined that they would need another extension to continue work on appropriations.",
      "Some senators had floated a December deadline in a new continuing resolution, but House Speaker Mike Johnson dismissed that possibility, since it would pressure lawmakers to approve new spending before the holidays.",
      "A future vote on health care tax credits",
      "As part of the deal, Senate Republicans agreed to hold a vote on the health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, which help millions of Americans purchase health insurance on state exchanges. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year, and patients are facing eye-popping increases for their insurance premiums.",
      "Under the deal, a vote would be held by the end of the second week of December, and the Democrats would have final say on what is in the bill.",
      "But a Senate vote on the issue is likely to fail, since most GOP senators are opposed to the Affordable Care Act overall and the tax credits in particular.",
      "That fact explains why so many Democrats are angry over the agreement, since it does not include an extension of the credits and only promises a future vote. That offer has also been on the table for weeks.",
      "\"There's no way to defend this,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in a video on X. \"And you are right to be angry about it. I'm angry about it.\"",
      "Last Friday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the credits. Republicans swiftly rejected Schumer's pitch, and spent Saturday railing against the ACA in speeches on the Senate floor.",
      "A \"minibus\" of 3 appropriations bills",
      "The deal includes three yearlong funding bills that lawmakers have been working on for months. The three bills include funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch.",
      "The bills have been dubbed a \"minibus\" \u2014 a smaller version of massive \"omnibus\" government funding legislation that lawmakers often adopt before the end of the year. Republicans in both chambers have emphasized their desire to return to passing individual spending bills through regular order, instead of through a large end-of-year package.",
      "The minibus includes funding for the relevant agencies and programs through September 2026. Because of that, the agencies would still be funded even if lawmakers fail to reach a funding deal in other areas by the end of January.",
      "Notably, it would restore full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which faced funding shortfalls due to the shutdown.",
      "A reversal of shutdown layoffs and restrictions on future cuts",
      "The new continuing resolution includes language that reverses the layoffs that the Trump administration implemented during the government shutdown, and prevents any cuts until the end of January.",
      "The resolution states that \"any reduction in force proposed, noticed, initiated, executed, implemented, or otherwise taken by an Executive Agency between October 1, 2025, and the date of enactment, shall have no force or effect.\" A reduction in force, or RIF, is the government's term for layoffs.",
      "The resolution also says that \"no federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force to reduce the number of employees within any department, agency, or office of the Federal Government\" until Jan. 30.",
      "The Trump administration began laying off thousands of federal employees during the early stages of the shutdown, an effort that was blocked by a federal judge.",
      "The continuing resolution says that \"Any employee who received notice of being subject to such a reduction in force shall have that notice rescinded and be returned to employment status as of September 30, 2025, without interruption\" and that those employees \"shall receive all pay to which they otherwise would have been entitled.\"",
      "Back pay for federal workers",
      "The continuing resolution explicitly provides money to provide back pay for federal employees, both those who have been furloughed and those who have continued to work.",
      "The legislation ensures that the workers who have missed paychecks since Oct. 1 will be made whole. Earlier in the shutdown, the White House had told agencies that a 2019 law ensuring back pay for workers might not apply to those on furlough.",
      "The relevant portion of federal law states that employees should be provided back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends,\" and the continuing resolution specifies that funds can be used to make the payments.",

      "Washington \u2014 The decision by eight Democratic senators to embrace a deal to end the government shutdown has infuriated many members of the party, with critics saying the lawmakers abandoned the 40-day fight without serious concessions on the health care tax credits that were central to Democrats' demands.",
      "\"Pathetic,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. \"There's no way to defend this,\" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut argued. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said \"it would be a policy and political disaster for the Democrats to cave.\"",
      "The reaction is a reflection of the frustration among many Democrats, particularly progressives, who had urged their party to keep fighting after the strong Democratic performance in last week's elections. But the shutdown's ongoing toll was ultimately too steep for some of the party's more moderate members to stomach.",
      "The resulting deal has exposed fault lines within the party that could reverberate over the months ahead and frame the party's internal debate heading into the primaries for next year's midterm elections. And it has led some congressional Democrats and progressive groups to call for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down, despite his personal opposition to the agreement.",
      "The shutdown deal",
      "The Democrats who broke ranks and voted to move forward had been engaged in bipartisan talks to find an off-ramp for several weeks. Led by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Sen. Angus King of Maine, the deal they struck secured a vote next month on Affordable Care Act tax credits that Democrats have sought to extend.",
      "But the agreement doesn't guarantee an outcome of the vote, and most Republicans have made no secret of their opposition to extending the subsidies. Even if some version of an extension does pass the Senate, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to bringing it up in the House.",
      "\"I understand the frustration and obviously I didn't agree with that decision,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told reporters Monday. \"But what we have to make sure of now is that the health care fight lives outside of the appropriations process and doesn't depend entirely on the government being shut down. So now we have a fight in front of us.\"",
      "The Senate Democrats who crossed the aisle have pointed to other provisions in the agreement to argue it was worthy of support. A new version of the funding bill would reverse all government layoffs that occurred during the shutdown and prevent them for a limited time going forward. The deal would also restore funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at higher levels, and pave the way for a bipartisan appropriations process on other spending bills.",
      "The eight Democrats also argued there is value in putting Republicans on the record with a vote on the health insurance issue, which Democrats have thrust into the spotlight with the shutdown fight. The moderates viewed the deal \u2014 after Republicans leaders refused to budge \u2014 as the best possible offer they could secure.",
      "\"We stood up to President Trump for 40 days,\" Shaheen said on \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.",
      "The New Hampshire Democrat defended the move to cross the aisle despite the lack of tangible progress on health care, saying \"we're going to be able to continue fighting on that issue because of the agreement that we struck with the Senate majority.\"",
      "\"But we're also going to end the suffering of millions of Americans,\" she said, pointing to the millions of people who have not received food assistance, and the federal employees and air traffic controllers who have not received paychecks.",
      "\"And we're going to live to fight another day \u2014 and that's what we need to keep people focused on,\" Shaheen said. \"It's not the Democrats who broke ranks who are the issue here.\"",
      "Critics are also directing ire at the party's leaders for allowing the defections. Almost immediately after the details of the deal came to light, Schumer faced calls for his replacement as the party's leader in the upper chamber.",
      "\"It's time for him to be replaced. He is not meeting the moment. He's out of touch with where the party's base is,\" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CBS News.",
      "\"Tonight is another example of why we need new leadership. If [Schumer] were an effective leader, he would have united his caucus to vote 'No' tonight and hold the line on healthcare,\" wrote Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Democrat who is running for Senate.",
      "For his part, Schumer outlined his own opposition to advancing the measure to fund the government Sunday, railing against Republicans for refusing to engage with Democrats on the health care issue during the shutdown while pledging to continue the fight.",
      "\"I must vote no \u2014 this health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home that I cannot in good faith support this CR that fails to address the health care crisis,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.",
      "Late last week, Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the health insurance tax credits. But Republicans swiftly rejected the offer.",
      "The New York Democrat faced a windstorm of criticism during the last funding fight in March, when he voted to advance a GOP-led continuing resolution. This time around, Schumer made a point of putting up a fight, engaging early with Republicans and the White House to negotiate a deal on health care while keeping his caucus largely unified against the GOP's funding plan for almost two months. Still, since the beginning it appeared unlikely that the leader would make it out of the funding fight completely unscathed.",

      "The victim also told police that Banuelos sexually accosted her, the court documents say. The victim told investigators, \"Banuelos was aggressively kissing her and punched her in the head. She said when she tried to punch him back, he got 'really angry,'\" according to the charging documents from prosecutors. The charging papers also said the victim said that Baneulos \"grabbed her shorts, pulled them off, and threw her, causing her whole body to fly in the air.\"",
      "The charging documents allege Banuelos strangled the victim, who told investigators he \"used a pressure of '10 out of 10' for a couple of seconds. (The victim) said that while strangling her, he told her that she was 'gonna be quiet' and she thought she was 'gonna die.'\"",
      "Banuelos faces charges of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault.\u00a0 A warrant was issued in Utah for Banuelos's arrest on Oct. 1.",
      "Police reports obtained by CBS News under the Freedom of Information Act said Cook County, Illinois sheriff's investigators found Banuelos at a Burger King in the Chicago suburb of Cicero on Oct. 17. The sheriff's department said Banuelos acknowledged his identity to officers when they stopped him as a passenger in a ride-share car minutes later.",
      "He has no listed defense attorney in his case in Utah and was not reachable for comment. It was not immediately clear if he was still being held in Illinois or if he had been transferred to Utah.",
      "Banuelos was among the later waves of arrests in the U.S. Capitol siege case. He was charged in his federal Jan. 6 case in March 2024, more than three years after the attack. Banuelos' case was unique among the tonnage of Capitol riot prosecutions, because he was the only defendant accused of pulling and firing a gun while on Capitol grounds.",
      "The Justice Department alleged \"Open-source media and CCTV captured Banuelos allegedly raising the gun over his head and, at approximately 2:34 p.m., firing two shots into the air. Banuelos returned the firearm to his waistband and climbed down the scaffolding, rejoining the crowd below.\"",
      "Banuelos pleaded not guilty in his Jan. 6 case, but never stood trial because of the dropped charges.",
      "During 2024 court proceedings in his Capitol riot case, Banuelos openly and brazenly predicted he'd be cleared of charges because of the reelection of Mr. Trump.",
      "When urged by Washington, D.C., federal judge Tanya Chutkan to be careful about what he said in open court, Banuelos told the judge, \"Trump is going to be in office in six months, so I have nothing to worry about.\"",
      "Banuelos is the latest in a growing series of Jan. 6 defendants to be arrested on unrelated charges after they were released from custody following Mr. Trump's Jan. 20, 2025, pardons.",

    "summary": "President Trump has pardoned dozens of people who allegedly took part in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, including \"false electors.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has pardoned dozens of people who allegedly tried to overturn the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, including those who were named as so-called \"alternate state electors\" to certify the results. Ed Martin, a Justice Department attorney whose focus is pardons, posted what appeared to be the\u00a0pardons document on social media, which was later confirmed by the White House.",
      "In addition to these alleged false electors, others granted pardons include former Trump personal lawyer and one-time close Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump's chief of staff from March 2020 to January 2021. More than 70 people are named in the document as receiving pardons.",
      "Electors are part of the 538-member Electoral College that officially elects presidents. In 48 states, they vote for the candidate who won a state's popular vote; elector votes in Maine and Nebraska are awarded based on congressional district and statewide results.",
      "The pardon document, dated Nov. 7, starts out by saying it \"ends a grave national injustice perpetrated upon the American people following the 2020 Presidential Election and continues the process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "In a statement Monday morning, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy.\"",
      "The document also says the pardon doesn't apply to Mr. Trump. That circumvents, at least for now, the issue of whether a president can pardon himself.",
      "The attempt to appoint alternate electors formed a core part of a federal indictment against Mr. Trump that was abandoned by the Justice Department earlier this year shortly before he returned to the White House.",
      "He was accused of participating in a scheme to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election. The federal indictment accused him and others of spreading \"lies that there had been outcome-determinative fraud in the election and that he had actually won,\" ultimately leading to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Mr. Trump denied wrongdoing.",
      "Presidents can't pardon people charged with state crimes.",
      "Prosecutors in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona and Michigan have filed charges related to the alleged false electors efforts. A judge in Michigan dismissed those charges in September, and many of the other cases have been held up by procedural and appellate days.",
      "Giuliani became a close adviser to Mr. Trump during his first term and was accused of spreading conspiracy theories and other unfounded claims about Mr. Trump's election loss.",
      "Giuliani was disbarred in New York and Washington, D.C., over his efforts to overturn the election results in Pennsylvania and claims he made in a federal lawsuit that elections boards there were engaged in a scheme to rig the election against Mr. Trump. He later\u00a0declared bankruptcy after being found liable for $148 million for spreading falsehoods about Georgia election workers.",
      "He was also indicted in Arizona for allegedly spreading false claims that the 2020 election there had been marred by fraud.",
      "A spokesperson for Giuliani, Ted Goodman, said in a statement, \"Mayor Giuliani never sought a pardon but is deeply grateful for President Trump's decision.\" He said Giuliani \"stands by his work following the 2020 presidential election\" and \"deserves to have his bar license immediately reinstated.\"",
      "Meadows was a prominent figure in Mr. Trump's attempts to stay in office after the November 2020 election.",
      "A year ago, the Supreme Court turned away Meadows' bid to move to federal court his prosecution in a Georgia case stemming from that alleged effort.",
      "Others named in the pardon letter include former law professor John Eastman; Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis, attorneys who promoted the claims; Kenneth Chesebro, who prosecutors said proposed the alternate elector plan in a memo to Mr. Trump; and longtime Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn. Powell, Ellis and Chesebro pleaded guilty in the state criminal case brought in Fulton County, Georgia, over alleged efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 09:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court rejected a bid by former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to overturn its landmark decision on same-sex marriage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not reconsider its landmark ruling that established the constitutional right to same-sex marriage, rejecting a bid by former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to overturn the decision.",
      "Davis, who served as the Rowan County clerk, drew national attention when she stopped issuing marriage licenses to gay and straight couples in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that the 14th Amendment guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry.",
      "Soon after the ruling, then-Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear sent a letter to all Kentucky county clerks directing them to immediately license and recognize the marriages of same-sex couples. But Davis had said that affixing her name to marriage licenses for gay couples would violate her sincerely held religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman.",
      "Kentucky later enacted a law that removed clerks' names and signatures from its marriage licenses. But until then, Davis and her deputies denied marriage licenses to several same-sex couples, including David Moore and David Ermold.",
      "The pair sought a marriage license from the Rowan County Clerk's Office 10 days after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. But Davis refused to issue one, instead telling them she was acting \"under God's authority\" and advising them to go to another county for a marriage license.",
      "Moore and Ermold sued several days later, alleging that Davis violated their constitutional right to marry. They continued to return to the Rowan County Clerk's Office and were repeatedly denied a marriage license by Davis and her deputies. Moore and Ermold eventually secured a marriage license from a Rowan County deputy clerk in September 2015, when Davis was jailed for five days for refusing to issue marriage licenses in defiance of a court order.",
      "Still, the couple pursued monetary damages as a result of Davis' actions, and a jury awarded them $50,000 apiece.",
      "Davis appealed the decision, arguing that because issuing Moore and Ermold a marriage license would have violated her constitutionally protected religious beliefs, she cannot be held liable. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit disagreed, and ruled that the First Amendment does not shield Davis from liability because she was acting in her capacity as a government official.",
      "\"In their 'private lives,' government officials are of course free to express their views and live according to their faith. But when an official wields state power against private citizens, her conscience must yield to the Constitution,\" Judge Helene White wrote for the court.",
      "The 6th Circuit warned that if it were to accept Davis' argument, county clerks who find interracial marriage sinful could refuse to issue licenses to interracial couples, or a zoning official opposed to Christianity could deny a permit for construction of a church.",
      "\"[W]hen an official's discharge of her duties according to her conscience violates the constitutional rights of citizens, the Constitution must win out,\" White wrote. \"The Bill of Rights would serve little purpose if it could be freely ignored whenever an official's conscience so dictates.\"",
      "Davis appealed to the Supreme Court. In addition to asking the justices to review the 6th Circuit's ruling, her lawyers asked them to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges.",
      "Her petition raised concerns that the 10-year-old decision could be at risk, particularly given the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022. In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested the high court reconsider a number of its decisions based on the principle of substantive due process, including the right to same-sex marriage and contraception.",
      "No other justice joined Thomas' opinion, and it was unclear whether four of the justices agreed that Obergefell should be reconsidered, and five would vote to overturn it.",

      "In a letter to President Trump on Monday, also seen by CBS News, Judiciary Committee Democrats wrote that Maxwell \"is preparing a 'Commutation Application' for your Administration to review, undoubtedly coming to you for your direct consideration. The Warden herself is directly helping Ms. Maxwell copy, print, and send documents related to this application.\"",
      "The letter says the information received demonstrates \"either that Ms. Maxwell is herself requesting you release her from her 20-year prison sentence for her role as a co-conspirator in Jeffrey Epstein's international child sex trafficking ring, or that this child sex predator now holds such tremendous sway in the second Trump Administration that you and your DOJ will follow her clemency recommendations.\"",
      "The letter also alleges that Maxwell is receiving preferential and lenient treatment at the Bryan federal prison camp in Texas, where she was transferred over the summer after meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss the Epstein case.",
      "\"Federal law enforcement staff working at the camp have been waiting on Ms. Maxwell hand and foot,\" says the letter signed by Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee.",
      "The committee's letter says the panel has received information that the prison camp staff \"has heaped favorable concierge-style treatment on Ms. Maxwell,\" such as customized meals that are hand-delivered to her cell.",
      "When Maxwell wanted to arrange a private meeting with visitors, the letter says, \"the Warden personally arranged it for her \u2014 and then provided a special cordoned off area for visitors to arrive, as well as an assortment of snacks and refreshments for her guests.\" The letter also says Maxwell's visitors were allowed to bring computers, which it calls \"an unprecedented action by the Warden given the security risk and potential for Ms. Maxwell to use a computer to conduct unmonitored communications with the outside world.\"",
      "Maxwell's defense attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "CBS News reported on Aug. 1 that Maxwell was transferred from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, to the Bryan prison camp, a smaller minimum-security facility. No reason was given for the move. Her transfer came just days after Maxwell's highly unusual meeting with Blanche in Tallahassee, in which her attorney said she answered all of Blanche's questions.",
      "In their letter, Democrats call for Blanche to be made available for a public hearing to answer questions from the committee about the use of law enforcement resources and any \"potential exchange of favors.\"",

    "summary": "James D. Watson, who helped discover the structure of DNA, has died at 97 years old.",
    "story": [
      "James D. Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.",
      "The breakthrough \u2014 made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 \u2014 turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But later in life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks.",
      "Watson shared a 1962 Nobel Prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder. In 2014, he became the first living prizewinner to auction off their medal, though the purchaser returned the award to him several months later.",
      "The breakthrough discovery suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper. Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dali and a British postage stamp.",
      "The findings, based on data from Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and other colleagues at King's College London, were a \"pivotal moment in the life sciences,\" said the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.",
      "Watson spent much of his career at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, becoming its director in 1968 and focusing the facility's research on DNA viruses that cause cancer. Watson, his wife and their two children lived on the laboratory's grounds for decades.",
      "\"Watson's extraordinary contributions to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory during his long tenure transformed a small, but important laboratory on the North Shore of Long Island into one of the world's leading research institutes,\" the institution said.",
      "Watson continued to make scientific discoveries. While at Cambridge in England, he carried out pioneering research on the structure of small viruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said. He also helped demonstrate the existence of mRNA in his lab at Harvard University in partnership with researchers at Cambridge, and later discovered important bacterial proteins that control gene expression, the laboratory said. He also wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, mentored young scientists and guided the early years of the Human Genome Project.",
      "Watson gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when London's Sunday Times Magazine quoted him as saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\" He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\"",
      "Watson\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the remarks after international uproar and was suspended from his job as chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and retired a week later.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \"No, not at all,\" he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab\u00a0revoked several honorary titles\u00a0it had given Watson, saying his statements were \"reprehensible\" and \"unsupported by science.\"",
      "Watson's combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \"a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \"His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim's views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\"",
      "Watson's DNA discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body's blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person's offspring.",
      "\"Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\" Watson once said. He later wrote: \"There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 08:33:14 -0500",
    "summary": "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" said the lead author of the study, which spotlights the impacts of planetary warming on aquatic ecosystems.",
    "story": [
      "When dolphins began washing up dead by the dozens on Lake Tefe in Brazil's Amazonas state, hydrologist Ayan Fleischmann was sent to find out why.",
      "What he and his colleagues discovered was startling: a brutal drought and extreme heat wave that began in September 2023 had transformed the lake into a steaming cauldron. The lake's waters reached 41 degrees Celsius, or 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 hotter than most spa baths.",
      "Their findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, spotlight the impacts of planetary warming on tropical regions and aquatic ecosystems, and come as the United Nations' COP30 climate talks kick off in Brazil.",
      "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" lead author Fleischmann, of western Brazil's Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development, told AFP.",
      "He recalled the \"psychological impact\" of seeing the carcasses of Amazon River dolphins and tucuxis, another freshwater dolphin species.",
      "It's an \"overlooked problem,\" he said, adding that tropical lakes, essential for the food security and livelihoods of local communities, have been far less studied than those in Europe and North America, and were assumed to be relatively stable.",
      "While this study focused on 2023, another record-breaking drought happened in the Amazon a year later. Such events are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting as a result of human-caused climate change.",
      "In all, the team visited 10 central Amazonian lakes, finding that five experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures exceeding 37 degrees Celsius, far higher than the 29-30 degrees Celsius considered normal.",
      "The most extreme reading came from Lake Tefe, which saw its surface area shrink by about 75%.",
      "According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a hot tub is typically set between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit, or just under 40 degrees Celsius.",
      "Officials from the\u00a0World Wildlife Fund Brazil\u00a0said 153 dolphins were found dead the week of Sept. 23, 2023, including 130\u00a0pink dolphins\u00a0and 23\u00a0tucuxi dolphins. Both are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and the latter of which are considered \"the guardians of rivers and a symbol of good luck,\" according to RiverDolphins.org.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here\"",
      "What made it even more remarkable, said Fleischmann, was that the same temperature was found not just at the surface but throughout the two-meter-deep water column.",
      "Using computer modeling, the team identified four key drivers: strong solar heating, shallow waters, low wind speeds, and high turbidity \u2014 a measure of water haziness.",
      "These factors reinforce one another. Shallowness increases turbidity, which traps more heat, while low wind carries less heat away, leaving the water more exposed to clear skies and intense sunlight.",
      "Another stressor for aquatic life was the large swing between highs and lows, with the peak of 41C in Tefe followed by a nighttime low of 27C.",
      "Though much of the national and global attention focused on the more than 200 dead dolphins recorded in under two months, they represented only the tip of a wider socio-ecological crisis, with fish also dying in droves.",
      "There was even a phytoplankton bloom that turned the lake red as the algae came under stress -- the subject of another forthcoming paper Fleischmann co-authored.",
      "To understand longer-term trends, the researchers combed back through NASA satellite data beginning in 1990, finding that Amazonian lakes have been warming at roughly 0.6C per decade, higher than the global average.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here, there is no doubt about it,\" said Fleischmann.",
      "He added he would be attending the COP30 summit to advocate for long-term monitoring of the Amazon's lakes and for greater inclusion of local populations -- including Indigenous peoples, non-Indigenous riverine dwellers, and Afro-descendant communities -- in developing solutions.",
      "Research\u00a0published in the journal Hydrological Processes found that droughts \"have significant implications for river water temperature extremes\" as radiation during these periods is more intense while water levels are lower and river velocities slow.",
      "\"Rising river water temperatures can have significant and often detrimental implications for aquatic life, impacting both individual species and entire ecosystems,\" study co-author and University of Birmingham professor\u00a0David Hannah\u00a0said. \"Drought conditions often coincide with high atmospheric temperatures and such trends will become more intense and frequent with climate change.\"",

    "summary": "A severe geomagnetic storm could cause widespread disruption to infrastructure technology and make northern lights visible for much of the northern half of the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "A severe geomagnetic storm is forecast to hit Earth's magnetic field on Wednesday, which could cause widespread disruption to infrastructure technology and make northern lights visible for much of the northern half of the U.S.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday issued a G4, or severe, geomagnetic storm watch in response to recent coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, from the sun. CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma that the sun occasionally ejects, NASA says. The highest geomagnetic storm level is G5, which is considered extreme.",
      "The latest CME was the \"most energetic and fastest of the CMEs\" that erupted in the past few days, NOAA said. It was also associated with one of the strongest solar flares of the current solar cycle. The flare\u00a0peaked around 5 a.m. ET Tuesday and was classified as an R3 or \"strong\" flare, meaning it has the potential to cause major disruptions to high-frequency radio on the sunlit side of Earth and cause low-frequency navigation signal issues.",
      "The severe storm is expected to impact Earth around midday Wednesday, the Space Weather Prediction Center said, although it noted the forecast is \"tough\" and it only had a \"moderate level of certainty\" on the timing.",
      "Another G3, or strong, geomagnetic storm was expected to affect Earth on Thursday, NOAA said.",
      "Northern lights forecast",
      "While the potential geomagnetic storms can cause disruptions to critical communication infrastructure, they could also make the aurora visible as far south as Alabama and in Northern California beginning Tuesday night, NOAA said.",
      "The University of Alaska and Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts say the best chance of seeing the northern lights starts as early as 10 p.m. ET Tuesday and will last until around 1 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "During that time, \"highly active auroral displays\" might be visible in places like Portland, Oregon; Cheyenne, Wyoming, and New York City, the University of Alaska said. The northern lights might also be visible close to the horizon as far south as Oklahoma City and Raleigh, North Carolina, the university said.",
      "In May 2024, a\u00a0powerful coronal mass ejection\u00a0brought the strongest\u00a0geomagnetic storm\u00a0in more than 20 years to Earth. During the CME, multiple X-class solar flares\u00a0were recorded. That storm caused some radio blackouts.",
      "Another strong geomagnetic storm in October 2024\u00a0led to the northern lights\u00a0being visible as far south as Florida and over bright areas like New York City and Chicago.",
      "Kerry  Breen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Apple accuses the EU of having an \"enforcement agenda\" that seeks to \"undermine the security and privacy of iOS and iPadOS.\"",
      "It's the latest complaint from an American company about alleged overreach from the EU's powerful digital laws.",
      "The tensions have factored into U.S. trade negotiations. In August, President Trump\u00a0threatened higher tariffs on countries with tech rules he believes are discriminatory to U.S. companies. In an April op-ed, Mr. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused the EU of engaging in \"lawfare\" to \"target America's largest tech firms.\"",
      "In recent years, the EU passed two major laws governing online platforms. The Digital Services Act requires platforms to follow certain rules on illegal or harmful content and advertising to minors, and the Digital Markets Act is designed to promote online competition. Tech companies can face hefty fines for violating either law.",
      "Apple was fined 500 million euros in April for violating the EU's Digital Markets Act by allegedly restricting app developers from steering users toward alternatives to the App Store. Apple appealed the fine.",
      "Since then, the company has become more outspoken in claiming the EU rules have opened the door to financial scams, pornography, privacy issues, and other problems.",
      "In its new letter, Apple says the European Commission sent an inquiry in October that questioned whether the tech company had put in place measures to ensure a high level of safety for minors, under the Digital Services Act.",
      "Apple fired back that the EU's other major law \u2014 the Digital Markets Act \u2014 required it to allow developers to link out of their apps to websites and other apps \"with no meaningful guardrails.\"",
      "\"This exposes users to fraud and scams on those third-party platforms that we cannot control or even monitor\u2014even for apps distributed through the App Store,\" the letter says.",
      "It continues: \"Apple has repeatedly warned the Commission that its approach to enforcement of the DMA is reckless and even dangerous, and urged the Commission to address the new risks their approach to the DMA has created for consumers,\" referring to the acronym for the Digital Markets Act.",
      "The European Commission could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "American tech giants like Apple, Meta and Google have faced scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, with regulators accusing them of stifling competition.",
      "Beyond the fines in Europe, U.S. officials sued Apple last year, alleging the company has violated federal antitrust laws by imposing \"shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines.\" And Apple has been embroiled in a long-running dispute with Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, over App Store fees and policies.",
      "Apple has long argued that its App Store restrictions are necessary to protect users from privacy, viruses and scams, and the EU's new rules could expose users to security issues.",

      "A massive search operation continued Wednesday in West Virginia, where officials said crews were \"working around the clock\" and continuing \"aggressive\" efforts to locate a missing coal miner who became trapped in a flooded coal mine Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"There is nothing that we would spare to try to save the life of the miner,\" West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey\u00a0told reporters\u00a0on Monday.",
      "Morrisey said Tuesday that about 6,000 gallons of water were being pumped out of the mining complex every minute, which he called \"a significant increase from earlier efforts as additional pumps became available.\"",
      "A simultaneous drilling operation could allow rescuers to reach the miner a different way, the governor previously said.",
      "\"While estimates from setup and completion vary for each method, using both approaches together offers the clearest path to success,\" he said.",
      "In an update Tuesday night, Morrisey said the effort was still a rescue mission and rescuers were trying to give the miner a \"chance to live,\" adding that diving teams and mine safety teams were taking part.",
      "The miner is the foreman of a 17-person team that struck a pocket of water inside of south-central West Virginia's Rolling Thunder Mine, causing water to rush into the complex, said Nicholas County Commissioner Garret Cole, citing information from the local emergency management and homeland security agency as well as reporting by CBS News affiliate WOWK. Rolling Thunder Mine is in Nicholas County.",
      "All of the other miners were accounted for in the aftermath of the flood, Cole said on Facebook late Sunday. Officials believe the foreman helped the team escape the flooding and that he is about three-quarters of a mile into the mine.",
      "Morrisey said in\u00a0a statement\u00a0that \"a section of the mine operation flooded after an old mine wall was compromised.\"",
      "Multiple local, state and federal agencies were involved in the search, in addition to specialized mining, cave diving and drilling crews attempting to pump water out of the mine, Cole said. By 8:45 p.m. local time Sunday, dive teams had entered the mine for a third time.",
      "\"From reporting from homeland security and media, it is amazing to see the mobilization of these many agencies getting to work so quickly and working around the clock in order to move as quickly, and safely as humanly possible,\" he said.",
      "In an update Monday, Nicholas County Commissioner Cole said the governor said there had been concerns about removing water while dive crews are simultaneously deployed, so crews were trying to remove the water as fast as possible.",
      "Cole said that coal seams inside the mine have \"created air pockets in the 'peaks' of the mine,\" and that officials hope the miner was able to find them.",
      "\"It was stated to me that the air and water is approximately 52-54 degrees, which means the miner would be less likely to suffer hypothermia, but would more be tasked in trying to become dry and keep in an open air pocket of the mine,\" Cole said.",
      "The commissioner called the emergency response \"a learning experience\" for him, in part because of the challenges the mine's terrain presents to search and rescue crews, and the fact that \"it takes so much time to safely and properly\" reenter it.",
      "\"This is a waiting game, in a most unfortunate way,\" Cole said.",

      "As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 1,200 flights had been canceled across the country, according to\u00a0FlightAware. More than 2,400 flights were canceled Monday.",

    "story": [
      "A severe geomagnetic storm is forecast to hit Earth's magnetic field on Wednesday, which could cause widespread disruption to infrastructure technology and make northern lights visible for much of the northern half of the U.S.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday issued a G4, or severe, geomagnetic storm watch in response to recent coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, from the sun. CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma that the sun occasionally ejects, NASA says. The highest geomagnetic storm level is G5, which is considered extreme.",
      "The latest CME was the \"most energetic and fastest of the CMEs\" that erupted in the past few days, NOAA said. It was also associated with one of the strongest solar flares of the current solar cycle. The flare\u00a0peaked around 5 a.m. ET Tuesday and was classified as an R3 or \"strong\" flare, meaning it has the potential to cause major disruptions to high-frequency radio on the sunlit side of Earth and cause low-frequency navigation signal issues.",
      "The severe storm is expected to impact Earth around midday Wednesday, the Space Weather Prediction Center said, although it noted the forecast is \"tough\" and it only had a \"moderate level of certainty\" on the timing.",
      "Another G3, or strong, geomagnetic storm was expected to affect Earth on Thursday, NOAA said.",
      "Northern lights forecast",
      "While the potential geomagnetic storms can cause disruptions to critical communication infrastructure, they could also make the aurora visible as far south as Alabama and in Northern California beginning Tuesday night, NOAA said.",
      "The University of Alaska and Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts say the best chance of seeing the northern lights starts as early as 10 p.m. ET Tuesday and will last until around 1 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "During that time, \"highly active auroral displays\" might be visible in places like Portland, Oregon; Cheyenne, Wyoming, and New York City, the University of Alaska said. The northern lights might also be visible close to the horizon as far south as Oklahoma City and Raleigh, North Carolina, the university said.",
      "In May 2024, a\u00a0powerful coronal mass ejection\u00a0brought the strongest\u00a0geomagnetic storm\u00a0in more than 20 years to Earth. During the CME, multiple X-class solar flares\u00a0were recorded. That storm caused some radio blackouts.",
      "Another strong geomagnetic storm in October 2024\u00a0led to the northern lights\u00a0being visible as far south as Florida and over bright areas like New York City and Chicago.",
      "Kerry  Breen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Cleto Escobedo III, longtime bandleader of the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" show, has died, Jimmy Kimmel announced on Tuesday. He was 59 years old.",
      "The late-night talk show host\u00a0mourned the death of one of his oldest friends \u2014 whom he met when he was 9 years old \u2014 writing on Instagram that \"[t]o say that we are heartbroken is an understatement.\"",
      "\"The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto's wife, children and parents in your prayers,\" Kimmel wrote.",
      "Escobedo and Kimmel met as children in Las Vegas, where they grew up across the street from each other. Kimmel wrote on Tuesday that they were \"inseparable.\"",
      "\"We just met one day on the street, and there were a few kids on the street, and him and I just became really close friends, and we kind of had the same sense of humor. We just became pals, and we've been pals ever since,\" Escobedo said in a 2022 interview for Texas Tech University's Southwest Collection oral history archive, disclosing that he and Kimmel were huge fans of David Letterman as kids.",
      "Escobedo would grow up to become a professional musician, specializing in the saxophone, and touring with Earth, Wind and Fire's Phillip Bailey and Paula Abdul. He recorded with Marc Anthony, Tom Scott and Take Six. When Kimmel got his own ABC late-night talk show in 2003, he lobbied for Escobedo to lead the house band on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"Of course I wanted great musicians, but I wanted somebody I had chemistry with,\" Kimmel told WABC in 2015. \"And there's nobody in my life I have better chemistry with than him.\"",
      "In 2016, on Escobedo's 50th birthday, Kimmel dedicated a segment to his friend, recalling pranks with a BB gun or mooning people from the back of his mom's car.",
      "\"Cleto had a bicycle with a sidecar attached to it. We called it the side hack. I would get in the sidecar and then Cleto would drive me directly into garbage cans and bushes,\" Kimmel recalled.",
      "News of Escobedo's death comes after Thursday's episode of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" was abruptly canceled. David Duchovny, Joe Keery and Madison Beer were set as the show's guests. The date and cause of Escobedo's death weren't immediately known.",
      "Escobedo's father is also a member of the Kimmel house band and plays tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, the father-son duo celebrated nearly two decades of performing on-screen together.",
      "\"Jimmy asked me, 'Who are we going to get in the band?' I said, 'Well, my normal guys,' and he knew my guys because he had been coming to see us and stuff before he was famous, just to come support me and whatever. I'd invite him to gigs, and if he didn't have anything to do he'd come check it out, so he knew my guys,\" Escobedo recounted in the 2022 interview. \"Then he just said, 'Hey, man, what about your dad? Wouldn't that be kind of cool?' I was like, 'That would be way cool.'\"",
      "In the 2022 interview, Escobedo said the bandleader job had one major benefit: family time.",
      "\"Touring and all that stuff is fun, but it's more of a young man's game. Touring, also, too, is not really conducive for family life. I've learned over the years, being on the road and watching how hard it is, leaving your kids for so long. Sometimes they're babies; you come back and then they're talking, it's like, 'What?'\" he said.",
      "Escobedo's survivors also include his wife Lori and their two children.",

      "Americans may soon be paying more for their favorite Italian pasta brands \u2014 or even have trouble finding imported spaghetti \u2014 as the Trump administration eyes a new import duty on 13 of Italy's largest pasta exporters.",
      "The proposal, published by the Commerce Department in September, would add a new 92% antidumping duty after a U.S. government probe\u00a0found\u00a0that some Italian pasta brands, including La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, were selling their products below U.S. market prices. Combined with the existing 15% tariff on European Union imports, the total duties on Italian-made pasta could rise to 107%.",
      "That would represent one of the Trump administration's highest import duty rates on any product, according to the Wall Street Journal, which earlier\u00a0reported\u00a0on the pasta dispute.",
      "If the anti-dumping duty goes into effect, the impact on American consumers would be substantial, according to Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru. Some Italian pasta makers may simply stop exporting their products to the U.S., while others might raise their prices, he added.",
      "\"You don't have enough domestic manufacturing to fill up those shelves,\" Lempert said. \"So you're going to walk into the pasta aisle and you're going to see it half empty.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS News, \"Italian pasta is not 'disappearing.'\"",
      "He added that the antidumping duty is a proposal and that it is not yet final. \"The pasta makers still have several months to continue participating in this review before this preliminary finding becomes finalized,\" he said.",

      "ByHeart, a manufacturer of organic baby formula, recalled all of its products sold nationwide Tuesday, days after some batches were recalled in an expanding outbreak of infant botulism.",
      "At least 15 babies in 12 states have been sickened in the outbreak since August, with more cases pending, according to state and federal health officials. All of the infants were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart formula, officials said. No deaths have been reported.",
      "ByHeart officials expanded the voluntary recall from two lots announced Saturday to all products in consumers' homes and in stores. That includes ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula and Anywhere Pack pouches of powdered formula.",
      "\"The decision to broaden our recall to all ByHeart products comes after a call with the FDA late last night, informing us that they found two more cases of infant botulism in babies that had also consumed ByHeart at some point,\" Mia Funt and Ron Belldegrun, the cofounders of ByHeart, said in an open\u00a0letter\u00a0Tuesday on the company's website.",
      "\"The FDA's investigation into infant botulism in the U.S. is still ongoing, and we feel that there are still too many unanswered questions,\" they said. \"Your baby's safety is, and always will be, our biggest priority.\"",
      "The company sells about 200,000 cans of infant formula a month online and in stores such as Target, Walmart, Albertsons and Whole Foods, according to Dr. Devon Kuehn, chief medical officer.",
      "Parents and caregivers who have the formula in their homes \"should immediately discontinue use and dispose of the product,\" Kuehn said.",
      "ByHeart said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0it enacted the unusual recall \"in close collaboration\" with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \"despite the fact that no unopened ByHeart product has tested positive\" for the contamination.",
      "\"It's important that you know that neither we, nor the FDA or CDC, have found Clostridium botulinum spores or toxins in any unopened can of ByHeart formula,\" Funt and Belldegrun said in their open letter.",
      "The company said its recall will remain in place while the FDA investigates the cause of the botulism outbreak. At the same time, ByHeart said it will test \"every batch of formula with an independent third-party laboratory\u2014a process which has already begun,\" and allow access to its facilities and unopened products for the FDA and California health officials to test \"without restriction.\"",
      "California health officials earlier confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart baby formula fed to an infant who got sick contained the type of bacteria that causes the toxin linked to the outbreak.",
      "The FDA is investigating 84 cases of infant botulism detected since August. Of those, 36 consumed infant formula, with a more than a third who received ByHeart formula, the agency said in a statement.",
      "\"This information shows that ByHeart brand formula is disproportionately represented among sick infants in this outbreak, especially given that ByHeart represents an estimated 1% of all infant formula sales in the United States,\" the FDA statement said.",
      "ByHeart produces formula powder at a plant in Allerton, Iowa, and then ships it to a site in Portland, Oregon, for canning and distribution, Kuehn said. FDA inspectors were at the Portland plant Monday, she added.",
      "Infant botulism is a rare and serious illness that occurs in babies under age 1, whose gut microbiomes are immature. It is caused when the infants consume bacteria that contain spores that produce a toxin in the gut. Symptoms include constipation, poor feeding, drooping eyelid, weak muscle tone, difficulty swallowing and breathing problems, among others.",

      "Jail records in Essex County, New Jersey, show Brown was released late Tuesday morning for the transfer to Florida. The former All-Pro wide receiver had waived extradition to Florida from New Jersey, where he was brought following his arrest in Dubai.",
      "Brown's lawyer, Mark Eiglarsh, said in an email that he has already filed a written not guilty plea to the attempted murder charge. Brown could be in a Miami courtroom as early as Wednesday morning for a bond hearing, Eiglarsh said.",
      "According to an arrest warrant, Brown is accused of grabbing a handgun from a security staffer after a celebrity boxing match on May 16 and firing two shots at a man he had gotten into a fistfight with earlier. The victim, Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, told investigators that one of the bullets grazed his neck.",
      "Eiglarsh said Brown was simply protecting himself from a person he had problems with before.",
      "\"The actions he was forced to take were solely in self-defense against the alleged victim's violent behavior. Brown was attacked that night and acted within his legal right to protect himself,\" Eiglarsh said.",
      "Brown was not immediately arrested that night because initially police did not identify Nantambu as a victim. It wasn't until May 21 that Nantambu gave a full statement about the incident to police and identified Brown as the shooter, the affidavit states.",
      "Based on his social media posts, Brown had been living in Dubai for several months. In a social media post after the altercation, Brown said he was defending himself because he was \"jumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry and cause physical harm to me.\"",
      "A second-degree attempted murder charge in Florida carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence and up to a $10,000 fine in the event of a conviction.",
      "Brown, who spent 12 years in the NFL, was an All-Pro wide receiver who last played in 2021 for Tampa Bay but spent most of his career with Pittsburgh. For his career, Brown had 928 receptions for more than 12,000 yards and scored 88 total touchdowns counting returns and one pass. He was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection.",
      "Brown has dealt with several legal problems over the years. He previously had been accused of battery of a moving truck driver, several domestic violence charges, failure to pay child support and other incidents.",
      "During a 2021 game with Tampa Bay against the New York Jets, Brown took off his jersey, shoulder pads and gloves and ran off the field, leading to his release by the Buccaneers and effectively ending his football career.",

    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other Trump officials told stories about Gor, the former White House presidential personnel director who is now ambassador to India.",
    "story": [
      "At a party Monday night to celebrate Sergio Gor's swearing-in as President Trump's new U.S. ambassador to India, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials told party attendees stories about the top aide who until recently held one of the most powerful \u2014 if largely anonymous \u2014 roles in government.",
      "Gor served as director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, vetting and hiring thousands of officials to work in the Trump administration.",
      "Rubio recalled sitting in a London restaurant with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Gor during\u00a0President Trump's state visit in September.",
      "\"All of a sudden this guy walks in,\" Rubio recalled. \"I'm like, 'Oh my God, that's Mick Jagger.'\"",
      "The lead singer of the Rolling Stones sat down two tables away.",
      "\"And Sergio's like, 'I'm going go up to him. I'm going to get his picture,'\" Rubio said. \"I go, 'Don't go up to him.' I looked it up online immediately \u2014 he's not like an enormous fan of the president. So, I'm like, 'Sergio, this might be really bad. We're in the guy's country. He's a legend in this country. I mean, I don't know how he's going react.'\"",
      "Rubio said he gave Gor one instruction. \"'OK, whatever you do, don't mention me \u2014 he doesn't even know who I am. And if he knows who I am, it isn't because he likes me.'\"",
      "Gor approached Jagger and chatted with him, Rubio said. \"All of sudden I hear: 'Marco Rubio would love to meet you. He's sitting right over there.'\"",
      "Rubio said Gor introduced them, and Jagger \"couldn't have been nicer.\" And he said that's when it occurred to him that Gor was \"going to be a good ambassador.\"",
      "Gor's ascension to U.S. ambassador to India follows a career in Republican politics with stints at the Republican National Committee and Congress, where he worked for conservative lawmakers. More recently, Gor was the CEO of a publishing company and political organization with ties to the Trump family.",
      "As personnel director, Gor helped choose who made it into the administration \u2014 and who didn't.",
      "Earlier Monday, the president made reference to friction Gor has had with some of his aides.",
      "\"Some people, when they don't like Sergio, they don't like him. But when they like him, they like him more than anybody. But most of them really are in the 'like' category.\"",
      "There were just enough \"likes\" in the Senate to confirm Gor to his new role along party lines earlier this month.",
      "Partygoers on Monday included Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. and Mr. Trump's White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, talked about card games she hosts at her apartment a couple of times a month.",
      "\"I do the cooking; they come and play,\" Pirro told the crowd.",
      "\"Sergio \u2014 and this is where we're really going to miss you \u2014 Sergio cheats at cards,\" Pirro said jokingly, to laughter. \"Sergio, may your diplomatic deals be as unbeatable as your poker face.\"",
      "Rubio took the microphone and deadpanned: \"I didn't know about the card cheating thing. \u2026\u00a0 That was not on the application. We cannot have that. Is anybody here from India? You did not hear that.\"",
      "The ambassador from India, as well as ambassadors from Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyz Republic, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan were also in the crowd.",
      "Rubio said some U.S. ambassadors have a direct line to the president, and Gor will be among the few who do.",
      "\"When Ric was in Germany, he could call the president,\" Rubio said, referring to former U.S. Ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell, \"and when Sergio is in India, he can call the president. And that it's an enormous sign of respect to the country you're sending them to.\"",
      "Rubio said he's been on four international trips with Gor.",
      "\"People ask, 'Why is the personnel director from the White House with you on these trips?'",
      "And I say, 'It's very important. We're talking about positions.' But in fact, it's because there isn't a country I've gone to yet that Sergio hasn't been (to) at least six or seven times. It's actually highly suspicious. We honestly try to ignore those things \u2014 'Why has Sergio been in this country 18 times?'\"",
      "At the Vatican for Pope Leo's inaugural mass in May, Gor told Rubio: \"Oprah Winfrey's here.\"",
      "Rubio said Gor claimed he already knew her. \"How does he know all these people?\" Rubio said, to laughs. \"This is very, very mysterious. I'm telling you, one day we'll know the answers.\"",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson will administer the oath of office to Grijalva at 4 p.m. Wednesday before the lower chamber holds votes on a funding bill to reopen the government, according to the speaker's office.",
      "\"After seven weeks of waiting, I almost can't believe it's true,\" Grijalva said Monday, lamenting that one of her first votes will be on a bill \"that does nothing for affordable health care for the American people.\"",
      "Grijalva was elected in a special election on Sept. 23 to fill the seat of her late father, Raul Grijalva, but the House has not been in session since Sept. 19, when it passed Republicans' short-term measure to fund the government for seven weeks.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has repeatedly extended what was supposed to be a weeklong break after the vote and ignored demands from Democrats to swear in Grijalva, who will be the decisive signature on a petition to force a vote on releasing files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Johnson's reasons for not swearing in Grijalva have shifted over the last several weeks. During the first week of the shutdown, Johnson said he would administer the oath \"as soon as she wants.\" But Johnson has also said that it would happen as soon as the House returns, that the delay was the result of a scheduling issue and that his decision to wait was \"following the precedent.\"",
      "The GOP leader noted that in 2021 it took former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, 25 days to swear in Republican Rep. Julia Letlow of Louisiana, who won a special election during the pandemic to replace her late husband.",
      "Democrats have countered that two Florida Republicans were sworn in earlier this year during a pro forma session on April 2, a day after they won their special elections.",

    "summary": "South Carolina is set to execute the third man by firing squad since executions restarted in September 2024.",
    "story": [
      "South Carolina's highest court has refused to stop the\u00a0execution of a man who killed three people over five days more than 20 years ago while leaving taunting messages for police in the blood of one of his victims.",
      "Stephen Bryant, 44, is being put to death for killing a man in his home and writing \"catch me if u can\" on the wall with the victim's blood. He is scheduled to die at 6 p.m. ET Friday by firing squad at a Columbia prison.",
      "Lawyers for Bryant made a last-ditch appeal arguing that the judge who sentenced him to die never got to consider how badly his brain was damaged from his mother's alcohol and drug use while pregnant. The U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0declined\u00a0in October to review Bryant's death sentence.",
      "Court's decision was unanimous",
      "The South Carolina Supreme Court rejected Bryant's appeal late Monday, writing that even if his defense had done more investigation into whether he had Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, it simply would have given a different reason for his problems while not changing the outcome of a death sentence.",
      "\"By any stretch, (Bryant) demonstrated a high level of planning, decision making, and calculation,\" the justices wrote in Monday's unanimous decision.",
      "Bryant is being executed for killing Willard \"TJ\" Tietjen in his home in October 2004. Investigators said Bryant burned Tietjen's eyes with cigarettes after shooting him and painted \"catch me if u can\" and other taunting messages on the wall with the victim's blood. He also took a potholder made by his daughter when she was child and dipped the corner in blood, authorities said.",
      "Tietjen's daughter called him several times, getting more worried when he didn't answer. On the sixth call, she testified a strange voice answered. \"And he said 'you can't, I killed him.' And I said, 'this isn't funny, who are you?' He said, 'I'm the prowler.' And I said, 'excuse me, who are you?' He said, 'I'm the prowler,'\" Kimberly Dees testified before a judge who determined Bryant's sentence.",
      "Prosecutors said he also shot and killed two men he was giving rides to as they stepped out of his truck to urinate over five days that terrorized Sumter County.",
      "Appeal detailed abuse and Bryant's mother drinking while pregnant",
      "In what may be their final appeal, Bryant's lawyers said that although his original defense team had noted that he was unnerved in the months before the killings because he couldn't stop thinking about being sexually abused by relatives as a child, they didn't detail how that abuse had affected his ability to conform to the law.",
      "Bryant's lawyers said he didn't get a full brain scan before his 2008 trial that could have identified in utero damage that was never repaired, according to court papers.",
      "They also included what they said was newly uncovered evidence including a 2024 interview with a clinical psychologist where Bryant described abuse he suffered from male relatives, his mother, a preacher's wife and several strippers in his neighborhood before he became a teenager.",
      "The justices sided with prosecutors who said the three killings, along with another shooting and two burglaries mostly along dirt roads in the rural Sumter County east of Columbia weren't impulsive crimes from a damaged brain but were methodical and cunning.",
      "Bryant can still ask the governor to reduce his death sentence to life in prison in a decision that, if made, won't be announced until minutes before the execution is set to start. No South Carolina governor has ever granted clemency in the modern era of the death penalty.",
      "Bryant has chosen to die by firing squad",
      "Bryant will be the third man executed by firing squad in South Carolina this year.\u00a0Brad Sigmon\u00a0was executed by firing squad in March 2025, the first execution of its kind in the U.S. since 2010.\u00a0Mikal Mahdi\u00a0was also executed by firing squad in South Carolina, a month later, in April 2025.",
      "Struggles to find drugs to use for lethal injection led to an unintended pause in executions and prompted state lawmakers to introduce the method that's often associated with mutinies and desertion in armies, as frontier justice in America's Old West or as a tool of terror and political repression in the former Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.",
      "Bryant will be the 50th person executed in South Carolina since the state restarted the death penalty in 1985. He will be the seventh inmate put to death in less than 14 months since the state was able to obtain a drug for lethal injection and reopen the death chamber after an unintentional 13-year pause.",
      "All the others have chosen execution by lethal injection after the state was able to obtain the drug needed because of a secrecy law. The state also has an electric chair.",
      "Bryant will have a hood placed on his head before he is shot by three volunteers from 15 feet away.",
      "Outside of South Carolina, only three other prisoners in the U.S. have been executed by firing squad since 1977. All were in Utah, most recently Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010.",

In May, Mr. Trump brought a number of high-profile business leaders with him to Saudi Arabia,\u00a0 including Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Palantir's Alex Karp, Citigroup's Jane Fraser, BlackRock's Larry Fink, Franklin Templeton Investments' Jenny Johnson, Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi, BDT & MSD Partners' Dina Powell McCormick and Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman.",

      "Washington \u2014 A provision of the legislative package that would end the government shutdown allows senators to bring lawsuits if federal law enforcement seizes or subpoenas their data without notifying them, with potential damages of $500,000 for each violation.",
      "The language appears to allow GOP senators to sue over steps that the Justice Department took during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Trump related to the 2020 election. In October, Senate Republicans revealed an FBI document that showed investigators had obtained phone record data from eight senators and one congressman for calls they made in the days before and after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The records were obtained pursuant to a subpoena in 2023, and the new legislation covers alleged violations dating back to 2022.",
      "The revelation that their call records were obtained infuriated the lawmakers, who accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the Justice Department to target Republicans.",
      "\"The FBI's actions were an unconstitutional breach, and Attorney General Bondi and Director Patel need to hold accountable those involved in this serious wrongdoing,\" said GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said the Biden administration's actions were \"arguably worse than Watergate.\" A spokesperson for Grassley did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new legislation.",
      "The document said the FBI collected \"limited toll records,\" which include information about which numbers participated in a call and how long it lasted, but not the contents of the conversation themselves.",
      "In a letter to lawmakers on Oct. 21, attorneys for Smith defended his investigative steps as \"entirely lawful, proper and consistent with established Department of Justice policy.\"",
      "According to the indictment of President Trump in connection with the 2020 election, part of Smith's investigation into the Jan. 6 attack focused on Mr. Trump's alleged attempts to call senators and representatives to pressure them into delaying certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory. Smith's lawyers have said he is eager to testify publicly about the two Trump probes he oversaw.",
      "The language in the new legislation requires service providers to alert Senate offices and the Senate sergeant at arms if federal law enforcement requests senators' data, and says a court cannot delay the notification unless the senator is the target of a criminal investigation.",
      "The bill further states: \"Any Senator whose Senate data, or the Senate data of whose Senate office, has been acquired, subpoenaed, searched, accessed, or disclosed in violation of this section may bring a civil action against the United States if the violation was committed by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or of any Federal department or agency.\"",
      "The bill says senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation of the notification provisions, and it prevents the government from invoking several types of immunity to rebut the claims. Suits can be brought up to five years after a senator is first made aware of a violation, and allows senators to bring suits for any instances that occurred after January 2022. The FBI analyzed the senators' call records in 2023, meaning they could bring lawsuits under the legislation.",
      "The government can defend against a suit by asserting that a senator was a target of a criminal investigation and by showing that a required notification about the records being pursued was delayed under a court order.",
      "The lawmakers whose records were obtained in 2023, according to the FBI document, were Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:00:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Over the weekend, top federal housing official Bill Pulte floated the idea of a 50-year mortgage with President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "A proposal for a 50-year mortgage wasn't fully vetted by top Trump administration officials and wasn't ready to be made public, sources told CBS News.",
      "Over the weekend, top federal housing official Bill Pulte floated the idea with President Trump, who then approved a Truth Social post.",
      "Some Trump officials this week vented their frustration with Pulte over the move. One source said Mr. Trump was lukewarm about the suggestion but announced it \"to get Pulte to shut up about it.\"",
      "Another source disputed the characterization of the president as tepid about the mortgage proposal, however, and said 40-year and 50-year mortgages had been discussed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett and others in the administration.",
      "Three sources said the Trump administration has been working on other ideas to promote affordability for Americans, including strategies to alleviate the housing crunch.",
      "The internal discussions on the longer-term loans were casual, and no final decisions had been made, the sources said.",
      "The 50-year mortgage idea came about when Pulte spoke to the president at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, two of the sources said. Politico reported earlier that White House officials were upset with Pulte, the head of the independent Federal Housing Finance Agency. The FHFA regulates Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks, which are tasked with providing liquidity to member institutions for home financing and community investment.",
      "After Pulte presented the suggestion, a sign was posted to Mr. Trump's Truth account with a banner at the top reading \"Great American Presidents\" over the portraits of two presidents side by side, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Trump himself. The words \"30-year mortgage\" appear over Roosevelt, while \"50-year mortgage\" appears over Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump approved the Truth Social post, and it went up at 1:10 p.m. Saturday. About half an hour later, Pulte shared Mr. Trump's post on X and added that \"we are indeed working on The 50 year Mortgage\u00a0 \u2014 a complete game changer.\" He also called it a \"potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now.\"",
      "No other details about the proposal have been released.",
      "Pulte didn't immediately comment.",
      "White House spokesman Davis Ingle said the president is committed to making home ownership easier by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply, and lowering costs. \"The White House and the entire Trump administration are appreciative of Mr. Pulte's efforts, and everyone is working together to implement the President's policies,\" Ingle said.",
      "The president defended the 50-year mortgage idea in an interview Monday night with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\"",
      "\"All it means is you pay less per month.You pay it over a longer period of time. It's not like a big factor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It might help a little bit.\"",
      "Analysts are still examining whether a 50-year mortgage would make homes more affordable for Americans. Some point out that while borrowers might pay a little less in monthly principal and interest \u2013 because the loan's duration is 20 years longer \u2013 the total cost for them would be much higher.",
      "\"The total interest paid over the life of the loan would be staggering, since even with a low rate, you're looking at 50 years' worth of interest,\" NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood told CBS News earlier this week in an email.",
      "At this point, typical homeowners spend 39% of their income on housing, well above the 30% affordability threshold recommended by financial experts, according to Redfin. Mortgage rates have eased this year but are still above 6%, about twice the pandemic-era lows. Home prices averaged $410,800 in the second quarter, about 25% higher than in early 2020, according to Federal Reserve data.",

    "summary": "After Sonder said it was shutting down, one guest told CBS News he returned to his short-term rental to find his luggage in the hallway.",
    "story": [
      "Sonder, a short-term rental company and former Airbnb rival, abruptly went out of business after Marriott ended its licensing deal on Nov. 9 \u2014 leaving guests scrambling as they were told to vacate their rooms immediately, according to accounts shared with CBS News and on\u00a0social media.",
      "Paul Strack, 63, visiting Boston from Little Rock, Arkansas, told CBS News he received an email from Marriott on Sunday about his Sonder stay, but he initially mistook it for a scam. The email said that Marriott's agreement with Sonder had ended, and that \"we are unable to continue your reservation beyond today.\"",
      "\"[W]e are kindly requesting that you check out of the property as soon as you are able,\" the email read, according to a copy obtained by CBS News.",
      "Because he had mistaken it for spam, he ignored it. But on Monday, after exploring Boston and returning to the family's accommodation at the end of the day, Strack found his room's door wide open and his family's belongings packed up and left in a hallway.",
      "\"Even our dirty clothes and toiletries were packed up, and our laptops were in plastic bags,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Sonder on Monday said\u00a0it would wind down operations immediately, and that it expects to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy to liquidate its U.S. assets. The company describes itself as a global operator of \"premium, design-forward apartments and intimate boutique hotels serving the modern traveler\" that has faced financial challenges related to its agreement with Marriott, which the hotel chain terminated on Sunday.",
      "\"We are devastated to reach a point where a liquidation is the only viable path forward,\" Janice Sears, interim chief executive officer of Sonder said in a statement Monday. \"Unfortunately, our integration with Marriott International was substantially delayed due to unexpected challenges in aligning our technology frameworks, resulting in significant, unanticipated integration costs, as well as a sharp decline in revenue arising from Sonder's participation in Marriott's Bonvoy reservation system.\"",
      "\"We explored all viable alternatives to avoid this outcome, but we are left with no choice other than to proceed with an immediate wind-down of our operations and liquidation of our assets,\" she added.",
      "Strack, who said he'd booked Sonder residences in the past, and until recently had enjoyed the experiences, was frustrated by his subsequent interactions with Marriott personnel, which he called \"not helpful.\"",
      "Marriott did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on its communications with Sonder guests after ending the partnership.",
      "Marriott recommended he stay at a nearby property for the remainder of the family's stay, according to Strack, which he estimated would have cost around $700 a night.",
      "Ultimately, the family spent their final night in Boston in the room that they had been kicked out of.",

    "story": [
      "Wendy's plans to close hundreds of U.S. restaurants in the coming months as revenue and profits decline, with the company citing cutbacks by lower-income consumers that it expects will persist through year's end.",
      "On a Friday investor call, Ken Cook, Wendy's interim CEO, didn't disclose the exact number or locations of restaurants that it plans to shutter. But he said the Dublin, Ohio-based company is likely to close in the \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its 6,011 U.S locations, or roughly 300 store closures if it shuts 5% of its existing restaurants.",
      "Wendy's said the closures will start in the fourth quarter this year. Closing underperforming locations will improve traffic and profitability at its remaining U.S. restaurants, Cook added.",
      "Fast-food chains have been struggling to lift sales as lower-income consumers feel increasingly squeezed by rising food costs. Both Wendy's and McDonald's have introduced value meals to entice diners, but Cook said he doesn't expect the financial strain on these households to ease soon.",
      "\"We do see more pressure on the lower-income consumer,\" he said Friday. \"We continued to see that in [the third quarter] and we expect that to continue into the fourth.\"",
      "The new round of closures comes on top of the closure of 240 U.S. Wendy's locations in 2024. At the time, Wendy's said that many of the 55-year-old chain's restaurants are simply out of date.",
      "Cook became Wendy's CEO in July after the company's previous CEO, Kirk Tanner, left to become the president and CEO of Hershey Co.",
      "Cook said in some cases, Wendy's will make improvements to struggling stores, including adding technology or equipment. In other cases, it will transfer ownership to a different operator or close the restaurant altogether.",
      "\"When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective. The goal is to address and fix those restaurants,\" Cook said during a conference call with investors.",
      "In the first nine months of this year, Wendy's said its U.S. same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 4% compared to the same period last year. Wendy's revenue fell 2% to $1.63 billion in the same period, while its net income fell 6% to $138.6 million.",
      "Cook said $5 and $8 meal deals \u2014 which have been matched by McDonald's \u2014 have helped bring some traffic back to its U.S. stores. But Wendy's isn't doing a good job of bringing in new customers, Cook said, so the company plans to shift its marketing to emphasize its value and the freshness of its ingredients.",

      "Mr. Trump is seeking to wipe away a $5 million verdict after two years of failed efforts to win a retrial of the federal case, calling Carroll's claims \"implausible\" and arguing testimony stretched \"credulity past the breaking point.\" He has since promised to challenge the case all the way to the nation's highest court.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied Mr. Trump's appeal in December 2024, and in June rejected a request for an en banc review, in which all the judges on the court consider the case.",
      "The Supreme Court is now his last hope of overturning the jury's unanimous verdict. The jury found that a preponderance of evidence supported Carroll's claim that Mr. Trump sexually abused her during a mid-1990s encounter in a New York City department store, sticking his fingers into her vagina.",
      "The jury rejected Carroll's claim that she was raped, though the trial judge, Lewis Kaplan, later wrote that the conclusion that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing Carroll by forcefully inserting his fingers was an \"implicit determination that Mr. Trump digitally raped her.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claims Kaplan \"erred\" in several evidentiary rulings that affected Mr. Trump's standing with the jury.",

Carroll's legal team received some of its funding from a nonprofit tied to a Democratic megadonor, but has said in legal filings Carroll was not involved in obtaining the outside funds, which they received nearly a year after she filed her first lawsuit.

    "story": [
      "You've seen the videos in newscasts and social feeds: Federal agents employing chokeholds, firing pepper spray at close range, and even using vehicle maneuvers to control immigration protests.",
      "These videos have spurred debate over whether agents have violated federal policies on use of force, which is authorized \"only when no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative appears to exist,\" according to Department of Homeland Security policies.",
      "A review of hundreds of videos, most recorded on cellphones by protesters and posted online, shows repeated instances that don't appear to meet that standard.",
      "We asked Eric Balliet, a career federal agent who worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations for more than two decades, to review some of the tactics used in these videos. Balliet led internal investigations into use of force misconduct for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement until last year.",
      "\"This isn't policing and law enforcement as I practiced it for 25 years,\" he said.",
      "Customs and Border Protection commander Gregory Bovino, who is leading the federal agents responding to protests in Chicago, disagrees.",
      "\"If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them,\" Bovino said in an interview with CBS News. \"Don't protest and don't trespass.\"",
      "Protesters and media organizations in Chicago have filed a complaint in federal court about the tactics employed under Bovino's command, as well as those captured on video recordings in Portland, Oregon; Los Angeles and other cities. Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Sara L. Ellis issued an order blocking federal agents from deploying chemical spray, tear gas or any other less-lethal weapon \"unless such force is necessary to stop the immediate threat of physical harm to another.\" The Trump administration has filed an appeal.",
      "DHS is now racing to file its implementation guidance in response to the judge's order. Revised directives informing DHS personnel of banned use-of-force tactics must be issued by the end of the day Tuesday.",
      "\"I see little reason for the use of force that the federal agents are currently using,\" Ellis said in her ruling from the bench.",
      "\"The use of force shocks the conscience,\" Ellis said.",
      "But President Trump said in an interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" earlier this month that the tactics employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"haven't gone far enough.\"",
      "\"I don't know where the leadership is here,\" said Balliet. \"It seems to be non-existent. Any oversight and justification for the use of force seems to be absent across the board.\"",
      "Balliet reviewed dozens of videos at the request of CBS News, and he identified several clear areas of concern with the tactics he saw in use against demonstrators.",
      "Firing less-than-lethal munitions at protesters' heads and torsos",
      "Videos taken outside the ICE facilities show federal agents standing several stories above protesters and shooting less-than-lethal munitions towards their heads and torsos.",
      "One cellphone video from September, taken outside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, shows a priest looking up toward agents standing several stories above him. In the video, agents fire pepper balls that land nearby him, and explode on the ground. One agent then fires a pepper ball that strikes the man in the head, and he crumbles to the ground.",
      "Agency policy prohibits agents from firing at anyone above the waist, stating they \"shall not intentionally target the head, neck, groin, or female breast.\"",
      "Balliet says such incidents show a lack of proper training.",
      "\"They are elevating the force to a degree that is excessive,\" Balliet said.",
      "During an interview, CBS News showed Bovino the September video and asked him if the agent had breached department policy. He said the agent had not \u2014 because the protesters were \"trespassing\" on federal grounds and the use of pepper balls didn't deviate from policy.",
      "\"The use of that less-lethal device, a pepper ball, was absolutely in line with policy. And I applaud them for protecting that federal facility there.\" He said use of force outside of the Broadview facility has been \"exemplary.\"",
      "Tear gas and pepper spray at close range",
      "Videos collected from Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles show agents deploying large amounts of tear gas and pepper spray at protesters, sometimes at close range.",
      "In one October cellphone video from Portland, a federal agent can be seen spraying a form of tear gas called \"oleoresin capsicum\" spray directly at an individual protester at close range and in high volume.",
      "The protester can be seen verbally confronting two agents in the street. Another agent then walks up to the protester and sprays her directly in the face with a large can of pepper spray.",
      "\"If you take direct shots to the eye, it can scratch or prick your cornea,\" said Balliet. In his experience, agents have gone to the emergency room for eye damage after being sprayed at similar ranges with this type of munition.",
      "DHS policy allows the deployment of chemical irritants only in cases when subjects offer \"active resistance.\" The footage shows protesters yelling but not physically threatening the agents, which Balliet said was not a sufficient provocation for this level of response.",
      "\"For this particular one, it's a little disturbing because there does not appear to be any sort of de-escalation attempt,\" Balliet said.",
      "Vehicle maneuvers used as deadly force",
      "Cellphone videos have also caught federal agents in several cities using vehicles to push or move\u00a0 demonstrators.",
      "In one video from Chicago, an agent in an unmarked federal vehicle slowly drives into a protester. The agent can be heard yelling, \"I'm gonna slam you on the f****** ground,\" as the vehicle makes contact with the demonstrator.",
      "Balliet says driving a vehicle into a protester constitutes \"deadly force,\" or what the DHS use of force policy defines as \"action that carries a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily injury.\"",
      "\"Anytime you introduce a vehicle into an already volatile situation, it drastically changes the dynamics,\" Balliet said. \"It rises into that deadly force arena.\"",
      "The fact that the vehicle was unmarked and the lack of communication created further risk, he said. A protester in the video can be heard saying, \"Who are you?\" as the car continues to push into the demonstrator.",
      "\"I can't stress enough the significance of markings,\" Balliet said. \"When you blur the line in that world, it presents a danger to everyone involved.\"",
      "Prohibited chokeholds and hand-on contact",
      "Videos received by CBS News reveal agents using aggressive hands-on tactics, including chokeholds, which DHS policy forbids unless the \"deadly force\" is authorized.",
      "\"Chokeholds and carotid restraints must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest,\" states a 2023 DHS Use of Force policy.",
      "But in two videos from Chicago, federal agents are seen putting their hands or arms directly around the necks of protesters during tense encounters. In one Broadview incident, agents surround a female protester who is attempting to block a car from leaving the facility. An agent, who is masked but not wearing a helmet, even as other agents fire pepperballs from an elevated location, puts his arm around her throat. Another officer then pulls the man off the woman and she is released.",
      "\"It's considered lethal force for a reason,\" Balliet said. \"If I were the commander, that individual would be off the team 30 seconds after it happened.\"",
      "In another Chicago video, a Border Patrol agent places his hands around the neck of a protester and slams him onto the ground. As the agent engages in the hands-on approach, he swings his rifle behind him, leaving the muzzle of his potentially loaded gun unprotected.",
      "\"The fact that that weapon, that M4, is just flailing around muzzling the agents, muzzling the crowd, is basically begging some bad actor to grab it,\" said Balliet. \"It's good that somebody didn't get extremely hurt or killed in this.\"",
      "Agents commended by commander, despite alleged violations of DHS policy",
      "Bovino confirmed no one has been disciplined in Chicago in connection to incidents documented during Operation Midway Blitz.",
      "\"Absolutely not,\" Bovino said when asked if anyone acted outside policy.",
      "But Balliet said he believes the lack of accountability could have long-term negative consequences for federal law enforcement.",
      "\"This is gonna have an irreparable harm to the trust and faith that the general public has in its law enforcement officers,\" he said. \"It is creating a divide that is going to take years \u2014 if it can ever be fully repaired.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said federal agents are \"trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves.\"",
      "The agency argued that protesters have \"thrown rocks, bottles, and fireworks\" at agents, \"slashed the tires of their vehicles, rammed them, ambushed them, and \u2026destroyed multiple law enforcement vehicles.\"",
      "\"Despite these real dangers, our law enforcement shows incredible restraint in exhausting all options before force is escalated,\" the agency statement said.",

    "summary": "Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Houston reported more traffic fatalities than homicides last year.",
    "story": [
      "Los Angeles\u00a0\u2014 Kris Edwards waited at home with friends for his wife, Erika \"Tilly\" Edwards, to go out to dinner, but she never made it back to the house they had purchased only four days earlier. Around 9 p.m. on June 29, a hit-and-run driver killed Tilly as she walked to her car after a fundraiser performance in Hollywood.",
      "\"I've just got to figure out how to keep living. And the hard part with that is not knowing why,\" Edwards said of his wife's death.",
      "Despite local, state, and federal safety campaigns, such as the global Vision Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities, such deaths are up 20% in the U.S. from a decade ago, from 32,744 in 2014 to an estimated 39,345 in 2024, according to data from the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Although traffic deaths have declined since peaking at 43,230 in 2021, the number of deaths remains higher than a decade ago.",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pew Research Center found, Americans' driving habits have worsened across multiple measures, from reckless driving to drunk driving, which road safety advocates call a public health failure. They say technology could dramatically reduce traffic deaths, but proposals often run up against industry resistance, and the Trump administration is focusing on driverless cars to both innovate and improve public safety.",
      "\"Every day, 20 people go out for a walk, and they don't return home,\" said Adam Snider, a spokesperson for the Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state road safety offices.",
      "American roads have become more dangerous than violent crimes in some cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Houston are among the major cities that now report more traffic fatalities than homicides. In 2024, the Los Angeles Police Department reported an estimated 268 homicides and 302 traffic deaths, the second consecutive year that the number of people killed in collisions exceeded the number of homicide victims, according to Crosstown LA, a nonprofit community news outlet.",
      "San Francisco reported 42 traffic deaths and 35 homicides in 2024. In Houston, approximately 345 people died in crashes and 322 from homicide.",
      "\"Simply put, the United States is in the middle of a road safety emergency,\" David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, testified during a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing this summer. Harkey said that, out of 29 high-income countries, America ranks at the bottom in road safety. \"This spike is not \u2014 I repeat, is not \u2014 a global trend. The U.S. is an outlier.\"",
      "In January 2017, then-Mayor Eric Garcetti joined 13 other L.A. city leaders in pledging to implement the Vision Zero action plan and eliminate traffic deaths in the city by 2025.",
      "Instead, deaths have increased.",
      "An audit released in April that was commissioned by the city's administrative officer found that the level of enthusiasm for the program at City Hall has diminished and that it suffered because of \"the pandemic, conflicts of personality, lack of total buy-in for implementation, disagreements over how the program should be administered, and scaling issues.\" The report also cited competing interests among city departments and inconsistent investment in the city's most dangerous traffic corridors.",
      "Mayor Karen Bass' office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Last year, California state Sen. Scott Wiener proposed a bill that would have required new cars sold in the state to include \"intelligent speed assistance,\" software that could prevent vehicles from exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 mph. But the bill was watered down following pushback from the auto industry and opposition from some legislators who called it government overreach. It was ultimately vetoed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said a state mandate would disrupt ongoing federal safety assessments.",
      "Meanwhile, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an influential automotive lobby, this year sued the federal government over an automatic emergency braking rule adopted during the Biden administration. The lawsuit is pending in federal court while the Department of Transportation completes a review. Even before Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, the alliance appealed to the president-elect in a letter to support consumer choice.",
      "Under President Trump, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is prioritizing the development of autonomous vehicles by proposing sweeping regulatory changes to test and deploy driverless cars. \"Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards were written for vehicles with human drivers and need to be updated for autonomous vehicles,\" NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser said in September in announcing the modernization effort, which includes repealing some safety rules. \"Removing these requirements will reduce costs and enhance safety.\"",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers, however, have criticized the administration's repeal of safety rules as misguided since new rules can be implemented without undoing existing safeguards. NHTSA officials did not respond to requests for comment about Democrats' concerns.",
      "Advocates worry that without continued adoption of road safety regulations for conventional vehicles, factors such as excessive speed and human error will continue to drive fatalities despite the push for driverless cars.",
      "\"We need to continue to have strong collaboration from the federal, state, local sectors, public sector, private sector, the everyday public,\" Snider, of the Governors Highway Safety Association, said. \"We need everyday drivers to get involved.\"",
      "It took nearly a month for police to track down the driver of a Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen allegedly involved in Tilly's death. Authorities have charged Davontay Robins with vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, felony hit-and-run driving, and driving with a suspended license due to a previous DUI. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is out on bail.",
      "Kris Edwards now tends to the couple's backyard garden by himself. Since his wife's death, he has experienced sleep deprivation, fatigue, and trouble eating, and he relies on a cane to walk. His doctors attribute his ailments to the brain's response to grief.",
      "\"I'm not alone,\" he said. \"But I am lonely, in this big, empty house without my partner.\"",
      "Edwards hopes for justice for his wife, though he said he's unsure if prosecutors will get a conviction. He wants her death to mean something: safer streets, slower driving, and for pedestrians to be cautious when getting in and out of cars parked on busy streets.",
      "\"I want my wife's death to be a warning to others who get too comfortable and let their guard down even for a moment,\" he said. \"That moment is all it takes.\"",

    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was disciplined just days into his sentence at a federal prison, an internal prison document obtained by CBS News shows.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is spending his early prison days working in the chapel and enrolled in an intensive drug treatment program, according to prison documents exclusively obtained by CBS News. He has also found himself facing disciplinary action for an unauthorized phone call, just days after being transferred to a federal prison in New Jersey, with the looming possibility of temporarily losing his phone and commissary privileges as a result.",
      "Combs was moved to the Fort Dix prison on Oct. 30 after being sentenced to more than four years on prostitution-related charges. The photo below, first obtained by CBS News, was taken for prison records upon his arrival.",
      "The documents offer a glimpse at how the hip-hop mogul is spending his prison days \u2014 in a hard-to-get-into treatment program and on a coveted work assignment, even as he is accused of flouting a prison rule.",
      "A prestigious work assignment",
      "Combs is working as a chaplain's assistant, which is considered one of the more desirable assignments at the Fort Dix prison. A former prison commissioner told CBS News the tasks vary, but typically inmates maintain the chaplain's religious library, clean their office and help with some record-keeping.",
      "Combs' publicist, Juda Engelmayer, told CBS News, \"He works in the chapel library, where he describes the environment as warm, respectful, and rewarding.\"",
      "What makes the assignment especially desirable is that it has prestige within the prison, the former commissioner said. It allows the inmate to work in a private office, often with air conditioning, and chaplains frequently bring in food for religious services which can be shared with the assistant.",
      "A corrections officer who worked in federal prisons for more than 20 years told CBS News the chapel is one of the only places where inmates can congregate freely.",
      "Chaplains can also allow their assistants to prepare a call-out list, which tells officers which inmates are allowed to leave their cell to go to programs or medical appointments. Assistants could add their connections or friends to the list.",
      "Combs, who said he was raised Catholic, has spoken publicly about not identifying with any specific denomination, although he has in recent years referenced God several times. In 2017, he wrote on social media, \"God puts us all thru things for reason,\" and he was seen reading the Bible in the courtroom during his trial.",
      "An unauthorized team call",
      "Within a few days of his arrival at the prison, Combs found himself in trouble: He made a three-person call on Nov. 3, in violation of prison rules. He told officials it was a conversation with his legal team about issuing a statement to The New York Times.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons prohibits inmates from adding multiple people to a call, and inmates can only speak to people on prison phones from previously approved call lists, under longstanding security rules.",
      "According to the documents, he called an unnamed woman, and about halfway through their call, Combs said he needed to talk with someone described as \"the digital person\" regarding blogs. The woman asked Combs if she should add that person to the call and he said \"yes.\" Combs first spoke briefly with the woman about arranging visitors for the weekend and suggested they bring cash \u2014 \"200 singles.\" There is no indication as to how he intended to use the money. Prison regulations bar visitors from bringing in currency other than coins for the vending machines.",
      "After they finished speaking about visitation, the woman added an unknown male to the call \u2014 circumventing prison rules.",
      "Combs later explained that he was speaking with his attorney and she added the head of legal communications to work on a statement for his approval to be sent to The Times. He said they were not talking about blogs. It was not made clear why Combs was putting together a statement for the news organization.",
      "Multi-person calls are banned in prisons because of concerns that inmates could use them to coordinate criminal activity, such as drug smuggling, gang violence or witness intimidation. However, such calls can also be used for more innocent purposes, such as talking to two loved ones at the same time.",
      "One corrections officer told CBS News, for example, \"They'll call their girlfriend, and ask them to add their mother.\" The source added that inmates run the risk of getting caught but know corrections officers can't truly monitor the thousands of calls taking place within federal prisons daily. There are over 4,100 inmates at FCI Fort Dix alone.",
      "According to prison documents, Combs said no one had informed him about the regulations on phone calls, and he said he never received the prison admission and orientation handbook.",
      "Prison officials recommended Combs lose 90 days of phone privileges and 90 days of commissary privileges for the infraction. Their ruling was filed on Nov. 4 \u2014 Combs' 56th birthday. It's unclear if the recommended penalty has been implemented.",
      "\"This is a serious offense that shows a disregard for the rules,\" a source close to the investigation said.",
      "Engelmayer told CBS News, \"It was a procedural call initiated by one of his attorneys and was protected under attorney client privilege. There was nothing improper.\"",
      "Combs' lead attorney Marc Agnifilo did not comment.",
      "An intensive drug treatment program",
      "Combs has been assigned to the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP) unit, known as the Bureau's most intensive drug treatment program. Correctional officials told CBS News that inmates need to qualify for the program, and one source said most inmates don't get placed in an RDAP at the start of their sentence.",
      "Sentences can be reduced up to one year by participating in the drug treatment program, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "\"Mr. Combs is an active participant in the Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP) and has taken his rehabilitation process seriously from the start,\" Engelmayer said. \"He is fully engaged in his work, focused on growth, and committed to positive change.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers had written to the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to \"strongly recommend\" that Combs be allowed \"to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts.\"",
      "During his trial, Combs' attorneys referred to his drug use as a primary driver of his infamous \"freak-offs.\" In a letter to the judge before sentencing, Combs blamed drugs and excess for his actions and said he was \"now sober for the first time in 25 years,\" adding that he had been trying his best \"to deal with my drug abuse and anger issues.\"",
      "\"Prison will change you or kill you \u2014 I choose to live,\" Combs wrote in his sentencing memo.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. Capitol riot defendant who was accused of firing a gun into the air while among the mob on Capitol grounds on January 6, 2021, now faces charges of sexual assault and kidnapping in Utah.",
      "Prosecutors allege John Banuelos, 40, attacked a woman in the Salt Lake City area in 2018, three years prior to his alleged involvement in the Capitol siege, according to court filings obtained by CBS News.",
      "A DNA test conducted in August linked Banuelos to the 2018 sex assault, prosecutors allege in a charging document filed in Utah.",
      "Banuelos' charges in his U.S. Capitol riot case were dismissed and he was released from custody in January 2025, after President Trump granted clemency to the more than 1,500 people convicted of charges stemming from the Capitol attack.",
      "According to court filings in Utah, Banuelos allegedly invited the victim of the attack, referred to in the court filings only as S.J., to his home in June 2018, falsely claiming there was a party at the house. According to charging documents, Banuelos beat the victim after she entered his house.",
      "Prosecutors said the victim told investigators that Banuelos \"hit her in the face and told her he was going to kill her.\u00a0 Banuelos then grabbed her by the shirt and dropped her on the floor, causing her to hit her head. (The victim) recalled feeling like Banuelos was going to kill her.\"",
      "The victim also told police that Banuelos sexually accosted her, the court documents say. The victim told investigators, \"Banuelos was aggressively kissing her and punched her in the head. She said when she tried to punch him back, he got 'really angry,'\" according to the charging documents from prosecutors. The charging papers also said the victim said that Baneulos \"grabbed her shorts, pulled them off, and threw her, causing her whole body to fly in the air.\"",
      "The charging documents allege Banuelos strangled the victim, who told investigators he \"used a pressure of '10 out of 10' for a couple of seconds. (The victim) said that while strangling her, he told her that she was 'gonna be quiet' and she thought she was 'gonna die.'\"",
      "Banuelos faces charges of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault.\u00a0 A warrant was issued in Utah for Banuelos's arrest on Oct. 1.",
      "Police reports obtained by CBS News under the Freedom of Information Act said Cook County, Illinois sheriff's investigators found Banuelos at a Burger King in the Chicago suburb of Cicero on Oct. 17. The sheriff's department said Banuelos acknowledged his identity to officers when they stopped him as a passenger in a ride-share car minutes later.",
      "He has no listed defense attorney in his case in Utah and was not reachable for comment. It was not immediately clear if he was still being held in Illinois or if he had been transferred to Utah.",
      "Banuelos was among the later waves of arrests in the U.S. Capitol siege case. He was charged in his federal Jan. 6 case in March 2024, more than three years after the attack. Banuelos' case was unique among the tonnage of Capitol riot prosecutions, because he was the only defendant accused of pulling and firing a gun while on Capitol grounds.",
      "The Justice Department alleged \"Open-source media and CCTV captured Banuelos allegedly raising the gun over his head and, at approximately 2:34 p.m., firing two shots into the air. Banuelos returned the firearm to his waistband and climbed down the scaffolding, rejoining the crowd below.\"",
      "Banuelos pleaded not guilty in his Jan. 6 case, but never stood trial because of the dropped charges.",
      "During 2024 court proceedings in his Capitol riot case, Banuelos openly and brazenly predicted he'd be cleared of charges because of the reelection of Mr. Trump.",
      "When urged by Washington, D.C., federal judge Tanya Chutkan to be careful about what he said in open court, Banuelos told the judge, \"Trump is going to be in office in six months, so I have nothing to worry about.\"",
      "Banuelos is the latest in a growing series of Jan. 6 defendants to be arrested on unrelated charges after they were released from custody following Mr. Trump's Jan. 20, 2025, pardons.",
      "Zachary Alam, a convicted Capitol rioter from Virginia who was released from prison after the Trump pardons, was arrested in May for breaking and entering at a home near Richmond, Virginia. Alam was found guilty of the charge last month.",

      "In a letter to President Trump on Monday, also seen by CBS News, Judiciary Committee Democrats wrote that Maxwell \"is preparing a 'Commutation Application' for your Administration to review, undoubtedly coming to you for your direct consideration. The Warden herself is directly helping Ms. Maxwell copy, print, and send documents related to this application.\"",
      "The letter says the information received demonstrates \"either that Ms. Maxwell is herself requesting you release her from her 20-year prison sentence for her role as a co-conspirator in Jeffrey Epstein's international child sex trafficking ring, or that this child sex predator now holds such tremendous sway in the second Trump Administration that you and your DOJ will follow her clemency recommendations.\"",
      "The letter also alleges that Maxwell is receiving preferential and lenient treatment at the Bryan federal prison camp in Texas, where she was transferred over the summer after meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss the Epstein case.",
      "\"Federal law enforcement staff working at the camp have been waiting on Ms. Maxwell hand and foot,\" says the letter signed by Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee.",
      "The committee's letter says the panel has received information that the prison camp staff \"has heaped favorable concierge-style treatment on Ms. Maxwell,\" such as customized meals that are hand-delivered to her cell.",
      "When Maxwell wanted to arrange a private meeting with visitors, the letter says, \"the Warden personally arranged it for her \u2014 and then provided a special cordoned off area for visitors to arrive, as well as an assortment of snacks and refreshments for her guests.\" The letter also says Maxwell's visitors were allowed to bring computers, which it calls \"an unprecedented action by the Warden given the security risk and potential for Ms. Maxwell to use a computer to conduct unmonitored communications with the outside world.\"",
      "Maxwell's defense attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "CBS News reported on Aug. 1 that Maxwell was transferred from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, to the Bryan prison camp, a smaller minimum-security facility. No reason was given for the move. Her transfer came just days after Maxwell's highly unusual meeting with Blanche in Tallahassee, in which her attorney said she answered all of Blanche's questions.",
      "In their letter, Democrats call for Blanche to be made available for a public hearing to answer questions from the committee about the use of law enforcement resources and any \"potential exchange of favors.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department and White House for comment about the allegations of favorable treatment being given to Maxwell in prison.",

    "story": [
      "Islamabad, Pakistan\u00a0\u2014 A suicide bombing outside district court buildings in a residential area of the Pakistani capital killed at least a dozen people on Tuesday, Pakistan's interior minister said.",
      "\"At 12:39 p.m. (0239 Eastern), a suicide attack was carried out at the Kachehri (district courts) ... so far 12 people have been martyred and around 27 are wounded,\" Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told reporters at the scene of the incident.",
      "\"As I entered the court building, a huge blast occurred. I thought the entire judiciary building would collapse on me,\" Zahid Khan, who works as an assistant to a lawyer at the court, told CBS News' Sami Yousafzai. \"When I went upstairs, I saw people lying on the ground around the fire \u2026 Just three minutes earlier, I had been at that exact spot while parking my bike.\"",
      "\"I saw many people lying injured, with blood on the road,\" he said.",
      "He noted the timing of the attack, coming a week after the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, along with some elements of the Afghan Taliban issued threats against Pakistani cities.",
      "Pakistani later issued a statement, saying te government \"strongly condemns the cowardly suicide attack in Islamabad that claimed 12 innocent lives, including members of the judiciary.\"",
      "\"The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has claimed responsibility for this reprehensible act, aimed at spreading fear and undermining Pakistan's justice system,\" the statement said.",
      "The alleged suicide attack in Islamabad also came a day after militants stormed a military college in Wana, in Pakistan's South Waziristan region. Two militants were killed in the assault, officials said.",
      "The TTP, in statements shared with CBS News, denied involvement in both the Islamabad and Wana attacks, but Pakistani security officials and analysts said the group was likely responsible for both.",
      "Last week, a TTP source told CBS News the group considers its campaign against Pakistan's government a \"holy struggle,\" and they warned that it has \"human and technical resources in all major cities\" \u2014 and plans to stage new, large-scale attacks.",
      "The attacker tried on Tuesday to \"enter the court premises but, failing to do so, targeted a police vehicle,\" Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told journalists. He alleged that the attack was \"carried out by Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" linked to the TTP, but he said authorities were \"looking into all aspects\" of the explosion.",
      "In a statement issued later Tuesday, Indian government spokesperson Shri Randhir Jaiswal said the country \"unequivocally rejects the baseless and unfounded allegations\" by Pakistan, calling it \"a predictable tactic by Pakistan to concoct false narratives against India.\"",
      "Pakistan's Minister of Defense Khawaja Asif blamed Afghanistan's Taliban rulers for allowing the attack to take place on Tuesday. The neighbors have long had tense relations, with Islamabad accusing Afghan authorities of allowing the TTP to operate within Afghanistan's borders.",
      "\"Kabul's rulers can stop terrorism in Pakistan, but today's suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts proves this is a nationwide war,\" Asif said in a statement Tuesday. \"Anyone who believes the Pakistan Army is only fighting on the Afghan-Pakistan border and in remote Balochistan should take this attack as a wake-up call. This is a war for all of Pakistan.\"",
      "Pakistan and Afghanistan held two rounds of talks aimed at addressing mutual security concerns in October and earlier this month, but both ended without any solid agreement between the neighbors, and Asif said in his statement after the Tuesday explosion in Islamabad that, \"in this environment, it would be futile to place greater hope in successful negotiations with the rulers in Kabul.\"",
      "One member of the Afghan Taliban's negotiating team told CBS News on Tuesday that the talks had failed due to Pakistan's unrealistic demands for the Taliban to restrain the TTP.",
      "\"It was far beyond our control and capacity,\" the Afghan Taliban official said, accusing Pakistan of failing to effectively counter the TTP itself.",
      "The Islamabad explosion also came a day after a large blast rocked the Red Fort, a major tourist destination in neighboring India's capital city New Delhi.",
      "That explosion killed eight people, and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Tuesday that the \"conspirators\" behind the blast \"will not be spared,\" vowing that \"all those responsible will be brought to justice.\"",
      "Pakistan and India are nuclear armed neighbors that have clashed often, usually over the disputed Kashmir border region.\u00a0Dozens of people were killed in May\u00a0when India launched military strikes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and deep inside Pakistan, saying it was targeting militants in the country that had carried out multiple attacks on India.",

    "story": [
      "Saint Petersburg \u2013 A Russian court on Tuesday sent an 18-year-old street musician who performed anti-war songs to jail for a third time as the Kremlin mounts a no-limits crackdown on any signs of dissent or opposition.",
      "All public criticism of Moscow's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin or the army is outlawed under sweeping censorship laws that rights groups have compared to those of the Soviet Union.",
      "Diana Loginova, a music student known by the stage name Naoko, was arrested last month after staging pop-up street concerts reciting songs by exiled Russian artists Monetochka and Noize MC in Saint Petersburg.",
      "The performances went viral, capturing attention at a time when public opposition to the Kremlin and the war in Ukraine is virtually non-existent.",
      "She has already served two 13-day sentences, being re-arrested and re-charged with new offenses immediately after both releases.",
      "Rights lawyers have said the singer is now caught up in a jail \"carousel,\" a practice whereby prosecutors lob a string of minor charges against defendants to keep them in constant custody.",
      "In the latest case, she was found guilty of organizing the mass gathering of people and sentenced to another 13 days in prison, an AFP correspondent reported from the Saint Petersburg court.",
      "Since Loginova's arrest, a flurry of videos in support of her and her band Stoptime have flooded TikTok, while other young street performers have expressed solidarity with her in public, risking fines or jail sentences themselves.",
      "The band's guitarist, Alexander Orlov, was also jailed for another 13 days. In court, he sat between his lawyer and a masked police officer.",
      "Street singers in other Russian cities who performed in support of Loginova have also faced arrests.",
      "A day earlier, independent media reported that a court in the city of Perm, more than 900 miles east of Saint Petersburg, handed 20-year-old performer Yekaterina Romanova 15 days in jail.",
      "Romanova, also known as Yekaterina Ostasheva, had performed in support of Loginova in Perm and had already been given seven days in jail earlier this month.",

    "story": [
      "New Delhi - Authorities in India's capital have urged elementary schools to hold classes online, banned construction and urged people to work from home as the annual plague of air pollution hit the \"severe\" category in a health warning system for the first time this season. For the first time, the toxic air has drawn protests against the government, and a warning for people with health issues to simply leave Delhi if they can.",
      "The severe designation indicates potentially serious health impacts for people with impaired immune systems, and negative affects even for healthy people, according to India's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).",
      "The emergency measures were announced after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) sharply rose to 425. An AQI between 400 and 450 is categorized as \"severe\" and, as a norm, requires authorities to implement emergency measures under the government's graded pollution response plan.",
      "Air quality in India's capital deteriorates sharply every year around this time due to a number of factors, including farm waste being burned off and seasonal climatic conditions \u2013 but activists say authorities have not done enough to contain the air pollution.",
      "In a first, hundreds of people protested against the bad air quality at Delhi's India Gate over the weekend.",
      "Several protesters wore gas masks as a symbolic act of protest and held up banners, including one that read: \"I miss breathing.\"",
      "Earlier this month, one of the city's top pulmonologists, Dr. Gopi Chand Khilnani, urged people with health problems who can afford to temporarily leave Delhi to do so.",
      "\"Everybody cannot afford to leave Delhi, because it is not simple, Khilnani told The Indian Express. \"But those who have chronic lung disease or chronic heart disease, those who are on oxygen, and those who have the opportunity and ability to go abroad or to less polluted places, I very safely advise them to leave Delhi for 6-8 weeks from now, so as to protect themselves from the distress of breathlessness, the requirement of oxygen, and so on and so forth.\"",
      "The toxic air is affecting the health of people of the city regardless of underlying health problems, with many Delhi residents complaining of breathing problems and eye irritation this week.",
      "\"Every breath in Delhi NCR [National Capital Region] today comes with a major health cost \u2014 we're seeing more patients struggling with breathlessness, asthma, and heart problems, especially among children, the elderly, and those with chronic diseases,\" Dr. Harshal Ramesh Salve, at the Centre for Community Medicine at the prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told a group of journalists on Monday.",
      "A recent report by the Lancet medical journal - Countdown on Health and Climate Change 2025 \u2013 carried a grim warning for India: The country recorded around 1.72 million deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2022, a staggering 38 percent rise since 2010.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration sent nobody to the U.N. global climate summit, leaving California Governor Gavin Newsom to ask, \"What the hell is going on here?\"",
    "story": [
      "In Bel\u00e9m, the bustling Brazilian gateway to the Amazon rainforest, leaders from nearly 200 nations have gathered for the United Nations' 30th Climate Change Conference, known as COP30, to chart difficult next steps in the global fight against climate change. But the absence of the leaders from the world's three largest greenhouse gas emitters \u2014 China, the United States and India \u2014 cast a shadow over the summit as it kicked off.",
      "Beijing and New Delhi did dispatch senior-level delegations for the two-week summit. The White House, however, said no high-level U.S. officials would attend this year's COP. President Trump has repeatedly dismissed human-caused climate change as \"a hoax.\"",
      "Two Democratic governors, California's Gavin Newsom and New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham, were in Brazil to attend the summit, representing state-level U.S. efforts to curb emissions.",
      "\"What the hell is going on here?\" Newsom asked at a global investors' summit in S\u00e3o Paulo on Monday, where he fired off a characteristic criticism of the Trump administration. \"We're in Brazil \u2014 one of our great trading partners, one of the world's great democracies. Home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with, not slapping with 50% tariffs.\"",
      "Ten years ago, 195 nations taking part in the COP21 summit signed onto the landmark Paris Agreement, intended to commit individual nations to take measures that, collectively, would limit the rise in average global temperatures to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The objective in the agreement, which the Obama administration signed, was to pursue efforts to cap the global temperature increase at 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) above pre-industrial levels.",
      "That target now appears out of reach.",
      "Based on national plans submitted this year, the planet is on course to warm by roughly 2.5\u00b0C (4.5\u00b0F) during this century. The Earth's average surface temperature in 2024 was the hottest since record keeping began in 1880 \u2014 and the last 10 years have all ranked among the warmest ever observed.",
      "Still, U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates in Brazil this week that after three decades of dedicated talks, \"we are now bending the curve of planet heating emissions downwards \u2014 for the very first time.\"",
      "\"I am not sugarcoating it,\" Stiell hastened to add. \"We have so much more work to do.\"",
      "A new U.N. analysis released this week shows that, if current national commitments are met, global emissions should fall by about 12% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels. That's an improvement from last month's projection of 10%, but still far short of the 60% reduction scientists say would be needed to keep warming within the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C goal.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has been pressing for stronger action, warning that surpassing the 1.5\u00b0C limit now looks almost inevitable and slamming it as both a \"moral failure\" and \"deadly negligence\" putting the lives of billions of people at risk.",
      "Despite low expectations for any sweeping breakthroughs, the delegations at COP30 are broadly expected to update national commitments to curb emissions in the next decade.",
      "A Brazil-led initiative to raise $125 billion for rainforest protection, coupled with renewed scrutiny of fossil fuel companies \u2014 which Guterres accused of \"holding back change\" while collecting record profits and government subsidies \u2014 were also expected to come out of the two-week gathering.",
      "There is also likely to be more pressure applied on the governments of wealthy nations to help finance climate adaptations around the world, to help developing countries mitigate the impacts of a warming planet.",
      "At last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries agreed on an aspirational goal of mobilizing $1.3 trillion annually by 2035, with at least $300 billion expected to come from developing economies.",
      "Publicly available data on how much climate finance has actually been delivered since then, however, remains scarce, and that could be a key point of contention for the negotiators gathered in Bel\u00e9m to discuss.",

      "\"I do hear everyone when we have to be very clear and stand up for our journalism. We are in a unique and precious organization, and I see the free press under pressure. I see the weaponization. I think we've got to fight for our journalism,\" Tim Davie said in the Tuesday call.",

      "In a letter to the BBC's legal team dated November 9, lawyers working for Mr. Trump alleged that the October 28, 2024 episode of the network's \"Panorama\" documentary program, called \"Trump: A Second Chance,\" which was produced by an external production company, sought to mislead viewers by editing together three separate sections of a speech made by Mr. Trump on Jan. 6.",
      "The letter claimed that the program \"has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\" and that it was defamatory under Florida law.",
      "It outlined demands by Mr. Trump that the BBC retract the documentary, issue an apology, and \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.\"",
      "The letter did not clarify what would be considered appropriate compensation, but it warned that if the BBC failed to comply with Mr. Trump's demands by Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern, Mr. Trump would file \"legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages. The BBC is on notice.\"",

      "U.K. media lawyer Mark Stephens said it would be hard for Mr. Trump to sue the BBC in the United States.",
      "\"Panorama wasn't broadcast in the USA, and BBC iPlayer (the BBC's streaming platform) isn't available \u2026 so it's not clear that any U.S. court would have jurisdiction to hear the claim,\" Stephens said on the BBC's breakfast program.",
      "The Director General of the BBC, Tim Davie, and its CEO of news, Debora Turness, resigned Sunday amid criticism of the program.",
      "\"Overall, the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said in a letter to staff.",

Since 2024, federal prosecutors have been seeking to prosecute an intelligence agent assigned as his bodyguard, identified only as Jorge Antonio \"S,\" as the alleged perpetrator of the second shooting.",
      "As of Monday, the prosecutor's office had not officially commented on the arrest of S\u00e1nchez Ortega, and authorities have not confirmed whether new evidence has emerged.",
      "According to reports, S\u00e1nchez Ortega was employed then as an agent for the Center of Investigation and National Security - back then Mexico's equivalent of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "Mario Aburto has been serving a 45-year prison sentence since 1994 after declaring himself the sole perpetrator of the assassination, a confession he later retracted, claiming he was tortured.",
      "As a result of Aburto's complaints, during the administration of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (2019-2024) the National Human Rights Commission recommended that the federal prosecutor's office reopen the investigation.",
      "Colosio's murder triggered a major political crisis in Mexico and was always surrounded by controversy fueled by the possibility that it was encouraged by certain spheres of power, amid internal struggles within the ruling PRI to choose a successor of then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.",
      "In a January 2024 statement, the Attorney General's Office said there was evidence that the agent assigned to Colosio's security was at the scene and had clothing stained with the victim's blood. It also stated that ballistic evidence indicated that he fired a weapon - with only a difference of seconds between the two shots - and witnesses saw him flee immediately after the shooting.",
      "In the same statement, the agency considered it confirmed that the National Security and Investigation Center, which in 1994 was under the Ministry of the Interior, sent the agent to the scene of the assassination only to later \"cover for him and take him out of Tijuana urgently and surreptitiously.\" The statement concluded that the agent's immediate release was \"an evident criminal cover-up.\"",
      "Since Colosio's assassination, other politicians have been targeted by violence in Mexico.\u00a0In 2010, a front-running gubernatorial candidate, Rodolfo Torre, was assassinated in northern Mexico. Plagued by drug-related violence for decades, the country has also seen numerous local politicians murdered recently, including a mayor who was beheaded in 2024.",

      "As if deadly snakes, spiders\u00a0and sharks\u00a0were not enough, Australia now has a new creepy critter: a \"lucifer\" bee with devil-like horns.",
      "The species, dubbed Megachile (Hackeriapis) lucifer, was found in the state of Western Australia, Curtin University announced on Tuesday.",
      "Kit Prendergast at the university's School of Molecular and Life Sciences discovered the bee while surveying a critically endangered wildflower in 2019 and was immediately drawn to the insect's unique appearance.",
      "\"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" she said.",
      "A fan of the Netflix TV show \"Lucifer,\" she said the name was the perfect fit for the bee's distinctively devilish appearance.",
      "Prendergast said DNA barcoding confirmed the new species didn't match any known bees in DNA databases. She also said the specimens she retrieved did not match any in museum collections.",
      "\"It's the first new member of this bee group to be described in more than 20 years, which really shows how much life we still have to discover,\" Prendergast said.",
      "She added that she hopes the discovery will raise awareness about the number of undiscovered species that could still be out there, especially in areas threatened climate change and mining.",
      "\"Many mining companies still don't survey for native bees, so we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems,\" she said.",
      "\"Without knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realize they're there.\"",
      "Almost all flowering plants depend on wild pollinators, particularly bees, but habitat loss and climate change are driving many vital species to the brink of extinction.",

      "Hamdi was in the U.S. for a speaking tour when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained him at the California airport, CAIR officials said. He had entered the U.S. legally with a visitor visa on Oct. 19, but it was revoked on Friday, Oct. 24, according to ICE. He was detained at SFO on Oct. 26. ICE previously confirmed to CBS News Bay Area that Hamdi was detained at SFO and said it was because he was illegally in the country.",

      "\"I do,\" Dietrich replied, speaking in English.",
      "The American man's relatives said he and his wife Aurelie were in conflict over the custody of their three daughters.",
      "Witnesses told investigators that Dietrich believed his wife had \"stolen\" their children after she received primary custody, according to a court document filed with an arrest warrant for Dietrich in August 2020.",
      "The children lived in France with their mother but spent Christmas and summer holidays with their father across the Atlantic.",
      "Dietrich's estranged wife and her new lover were found naked, their bodies riddled with bullets and covered in blood in the woman's bedroom. Investigators found 18 gun casings at the scene, according to the court document.",

      "The Colorado resident admitted to returning to France at the time of the crime for less than 48 hours without informing his family or daughters, who were with him in the U.S. for the summer holidays.",
      "Dietrich was arrested in August 2020. He admitted to having gone to Aurelie's place but denied having broken into her home.",
      "Confronted with photos of the bodies, he described the scene as \"savage\" and \"disgusting\" but insisted he had nothing to do with it.",
      "He accused investigators of being biased and claimed that some evidence had been falsified by the police.",
      "\"The police very much think that the law must be followed by you, the suckers, and not by them,\" he said in court.",

      "Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa met President Trump at the White House on Monday, continuing a stunning reversal of fortunes for a man branded until three days ago as an international terrorist by the U.S. government with a $10 million bounty on his head.",
      "The former leader of an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria disavowed Islamic extremism after rising to lead his war-torn country. Nearly a year ago, he led his rebel militia to force long-time dictator Bashar al-Assad out of office and into exile in Russia.",
      "Syria was crippled for decades under sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other nations against Assad, and Al-Sharaa is now seeking to normalize relations.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed to CBS News on Monday that Syria will be joining the U.S.-led Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS, marking a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy. Al-Sharaa's own former militia, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, opposed ISIS during the latter years of Syria's 14-year civil war, when he went by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "He was expected to possibly sign a formal agreement with President Trump during their in person meeting on Monday \u2014 which will be their third to date \u2014 to cooperate on counterterrorism. That would be a highly symbolic moment, indicating a 180-degree turnaround in how Syria is viewed by the U.S. government.",
      "Under Assad about 12 years ago, ISIS was allowed to grow and metastasize into one of the most powerful terrorist organizations in the world. At one point, it controlled a huge swath of land spanning the Syria-Iraq border.",
      "After meeting Al-Sharaa for the first time in Saudi Arabia in May, Mr. Trump called the Syrian leader a \"young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past.\"",
      "Over the weekend, he also became the first Syrian leader to shoot some hoops with the U.S. military. Video shared Saturday by the Syrian foreign ministry shows him nailing a three-pointer as he plays with a U.S. admiral and a brigadier general at an undisclosed location in the U.S.",
      "But until Friday morning, the Syrian president was still officially designated a terrorist by the U.S. government, as he had been since 2013. That designation was lifted by the end of the day.",
      "There was expected to possibly be discussion at the White House on Monday about the official lifting of U.S. economic sanctions against Syria, which Mr.\u00a0Trump put in motion in May with an executive order.",
      "That order removed sanctions on Syria, \"while maintaining sanctions on the former president, Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, persons linked to chemical weapons activities, ISIS and their affiliates, and Iranian proxies,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in June.",
      "Al-Sharaa's transitional government has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief for months, and work had been underway to ease some sanctions even before the president's May announcement, but other measures still need to be formally revoked by Congress.",
      "In an apparent bid to show its determination to crack down on ISIS and other extremists, the Syrian government announced that more than 70 alleged members of the group had been detained just hours before al-Sharaa landed in Washington.",
      "In September, addressing the U.N. General Assembly in New York \u2014 another landmark moment as it had been nearly six decades since a Syrian leader had done so \u2014 Al-Sharaa told the gathered leaders that his country was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world.\"",
      "But to reclaim its place, it also needs to rebuild \u2014 a herculean task that Al-Sharaa recently told CBS News' Margaret Brennan in an interview for 60 Minutes will likely cost $600-$900 billion.",
      "He stressed that it would require the international community's help.",
      "\"The world watched this tragedy unfold for 14 years and couldn't do anything to stop this massive crime,\" he said of the Syrian civil war. \"So, the world today should provide support to Syria.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was released from prison on Monday after a Paris court granted him release under judicial supervision.",
      "Monday's announcement came less than three weeks after Sarkozy, 70, began serving a five-year sentence for criminal conspiracy in a scheme to finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from Libya.",
      "Sarkozy left La Sant\u00e9 prison by car and later quickly stepped into his home in western Paris. The brief scene was in contrast to his very public incarceration 20 days earlier, when he walked down the alley near his house hand-in-hand with his wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, as he waved to supporters.",
      "The former president, who denies wrongdoing, is banned from leaving the French territory and from being in touch with key people, including co-defendants and witnesses in the case, the court said.",
      "An appeals trial is expected to take place later, possibly in the spring.",
      "Sarkozy became the first former French head of state in modern times to be sent behind bars after his conviction on Sept. 25. He denies any wrongdoing. He was jailed on Oct. 21 pending appeal but immediately filed for early release.",
      "During a hearing on Monday examining his request, Sarkozy, speaking from Paris' La Sant\u00e9 prison via video conference, argued he has always met all justice requirements.",
      "\"I had never imagined I would experience prison at 70. This ordeal was imposed on me, and I lived through it. It's hard, very hard,\" he said.",
      "Sarkozy also paid tribute to prison staff who he said helped him through \"this nightmare.\" Sarkozy's wife and two of his sons attended the hearing at the Paris courthouse.",
      "Monday's proceedings didn't involve the motives for the sentencing.",
      "Still, Sarkozy told the court he never asked Libya's longtime ruler Muammar Qaddafi for any financing. \"I will never admit something I didn't do,\" he said.",
      "Under French law, release is set to be the general rule pending appeal, while detention remains the exception. Judges weighed whether Sarkozy presents a flight risk, might pressure witnesses, or could obstruct justice.",
      "Advocate General Damien Brunet, who represents the public interest, asked for Sarkozy to be released and placed under judicial supervision.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military has killed six more people in strikes on what it claims were drug-running boats, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday, bringing the total death toll in the series of attacks to 76.",
      "Hegseth said\u00a0in a post on X\u00a0that the U.S. carried out two strikes on Sunday in international waters in the eastern Pacific, targeting two boats that were \"carrying narcotics\" with three \"male narco-terrorists\" on board each.",
      "\"All 6 were killed. No U.S. forces were harmed,\" he said.",

      "The Trump administration has said in a notice to Congress that the United States is engaged in \"armed conflict\" with Latin American drug cartels, describing them as terrorist groups as part of its justification for the strikes.",

      "U.N. climate negotiations get underway Monday at a meeting on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, with leaders pushing for urgency, cooperation and acceleration after more than 30 years fighting to curb global warming by drastically reducing the carbon pollution that causes it.",
      "Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, president of this year's conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in \"mutir\u00e3o,\" a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.",
      "\"Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,\" do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators Sunday. \"We can change. But we must do it together.\"",
      "Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.",
      "The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.",
      "\"I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,\" said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States. Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land. \"The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity'' of the whole negotiating system.",

      "\"It's a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn't going to be constructive if they did,\" he said.",

The\u00a0State of the Global Climate report\u00a0confirmed global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024.",
      "In a mission statement published ahead of COP30, organizers wrote, \"We have made progress, but not enough. Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present.\"",
      "\"We need to accelerate the fight against global warming and strengthen multilateralism in combating climate change,\" they said, noting that \"climate change has increased the exposure of the poorest to natural disasters.\"",
      "In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, \"but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already, from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, Super Typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines, to a tornado ripping through Southern Brazil.\"",
      "Not only must nations do more faster but they \"must connect climate action to people's real lives,\" Stiell wrote.",
      "The Nature Conservancy chief scientist Katharine Hayhoe compared the multinational negotiations to a potluck dinner.",
      "\"Everybody brings the contributions that they are making,\" which in this instance are new and strengthened plans to cut carbon pollution, Hayhoe said. \"And it's obvious who took the time to bake the fresh pie with fruit that they picked and who fished out that year old chicken frozen chicken nuggets from the back of their freezer.\"",
      "\"The United States as a country will not be showing up with a dish,\" Hayhoe said. However, she and several others including former lead American negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will take up the slack.",

      "Experts have not yet dated the wreck, but preliminary findings suggest it was built between the 14th and 16th centuries \u2014 when UNESCO-listed Hoi An was at the center of a thriving regional trade in silk, ceramics and spices.",

      "In the past week Belgium's main international airport in Brussels and one of Europe's biggest cargo airports, near the Belgian city of Liege, were forced to close temporarily because of drone incursions.

      "Local residents could hear gunfire, explosions, and cries for help coming from inside the prison's walls, AFP reported.",

      "Authorities did not specify the identities of the deceased or confirm whether the violence was another case of inter-gang fighting.",

      "\"While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,\" she added.",
      "Speaking Monday morning with some of the BBC's own journalists outside her home in London, Turness repeated that she had stepped down \"because the buck stops with me. But I'd like to make one thing very clear, BBC News is not institutionally biased. That's why it's the world's most trusted news provider.\"",
      "Asked about the White House's accusation that the BBC is corrupt, Turness said: \"Our journalists aren't corrupt and I will stand by their journalism,\" adding that she was confident the \"story will emerge\" as to how mistakes were made on coverage of topics including Mr. Trump, antisemitism and women's rights.",

      "As well as the edit of Mr. Trump, the dossier criticized the BBC's coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns about alleged anti-Israel bias in the BBC's Arabic service.",

      "\"He has led the BBC through a period of significant change and helped the organisation to grip the challenges it has faced in recent years,\" she said in a statement on X. \"Now more than ever, the need for trusted news and high quality programming is essential to our democratic and cultural life, and our place in the world.\"",
      "The BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters \u2014 and criticism from its commercial rivals \u2014 because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households with a television.",

      "No. 2: Use meaningful tests \u2014 not just standard bloodwork",
      "Attia recommends closely tracking VO\u2082 max, which measures the maximum amount of oxygen the body uses during strenuous exercise.",

      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure,\" Attia said. \"It predicts your risk of death from any cause, even more than your blood pressure, cholesterol or smoking status.\"",
      "\"I think this is the neglected part of medical testing, is how fit are you, how strong are you, how well do you move?\" he said. \"And in many ways, these tests are even more predictive of how long you're going to live than what I might get out of your bloodwork.\"",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure.\"",
      "Attia also uses scans like DEXA (short for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), which measures bone density, muscle mass and body fat.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" he added.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" the doctor said. (iStock)",

      "He also recommends getting tested for APOE, the gene that indicates an elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Having one copy of the gene roughly doubles or triples the chances of developing the common dementia, while two copies raises the risk by 10 times and lowers the average age of onset by five to 10 years, data shows.",
      "No. 3: Eat more protein than standard guidelines suggest",
      "Boosting protein intake has been linked to increased muscle mass and strength, stronger immune function and reduced disease burden, studies show.",
      "Attia recommends consuming more than twice the protein recommended in current nutritional guidelines.",

    "story": [
      "In 2018, President Donald Trump warned Germany would become \"totally dependent\" on Russia for its energy needs as he praised a Baltic pipeline that would reduce dependence on Kremlin oil. (Credit: C-SPAN, Sept. 25, 2018)",
      "When Donald Trump warned European leaders years ago that their dependence on Russian gas would leave them \"hostage to Moscow,\" the remark was met with skepticism \u2014 and even laughter.",
      "Nearly a year into his second term, those same leaders are now scrambling to secure long-term contracts for U.S. liquefied natural gas as Russia\u2019s once-dominant grip on Europe\u2019s energy market unravels exactly as Trump predicted.",
      "Russia\u2019s decision to choke off gas deliveries in 2022 \u2014 an attempt to fracture Western unity and pressure Europe into abandoning Ukraine \u2014 has had the opposite effect. Its share of European Union gas imports has fallen from 45% in 2021 to under 10% today. U.S. gas now accounts for nearly 57% of Europe\u2019s total imports, compared to roughly one-third before the war.",
      "The cutoff accelerated a historic realignment in global energy, with U.S. LNG producers rushing to fill the void. The shift has not only blunted one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s most powerful geopolitical weapons but also fueled an American export boom that is binding Europe more tightly to Washington than at any point since the Cold War.",

      "The transformation is most visible in Central and Eastern Europe, where countries once reliant on Russian pipelines are turning west. New corridors linking LNG terminals in Poland, Greece and Croatia are channeling U.S. and Qatari gas deep into the continent. Nations such as Ukraine, Romania and Slovakia \u2014 long vulnerable to supply cutoffs \u2014 are forging contracts that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.",
      "\"Central and Eastern Europe have been the most vulnerable because these were the countries that had been historically almost 100% dependent on Russian gas,\" said Aura Sabadus, a senior energy analyst at the Center for European Policy Analysis. \"Now we see companies in those markets securing U.S. LNG through new routes, particularly via Poland and southern corridors through Greece.\"",
      "In Athens last week, executives from major U.S. producers met with regional buyers from Greece, Poland and Ukraine to finalize new supply deals \u2014 the clearest sign yet that Europe\u2019s energy axis has shifted. American gas now flows through the same infrastructure that once carried Russian fuel, and the geopolitical balance has flipped with it.",
      "For the Kremlin, the toll is mounting. Energy exports once funded a third of Russia\u2019s budget, but the loss of its most lucrative market has forced Moscow to sell oil and gas to China and India at steep discounts. Analysts say the country\u2019s energy sector \u2014 once the backbone of its geopolitical power \u2014 has become a liability, exposing its dependence on fewer, less profitable buyers.",

      "Greece has emerged as a key gateway for U.S. gas. On November 7, Athens signed its first long-term deal with American exporter Venture Global to import at least 700 million cubic meters annually beginning in 2030. The 20-year agreement, led by DEPA Commercial and Aktor Group, could expand to 2 billion cubic meters per year and allow Greece to re-export gas north through the Balkans toward Ukraine.",
      "Poland is also positioning itself as a regional hub. Warsaw is negotiating to bring in additional U.S. LNG volumes \u2014 estimated at up to 5 billion cubic meters annually \u2014 for resale to Ukraine and Slovakia. Poland\u2019s energy group ORLEN recently signed a contract with Ukraine\u2019s Naftogaz to deliver 140 million cubic meters of American gas through terminals in \u015awinouj\u015bcie and Lithuania\u2019s Klaip\u0117da.",

      "Sabadus said Europe\u2019s pivot will likely accelerate as the EU debates a full ban on Russian pipeline gas and LNG by 2028. \"If that law is adopted and enforced \u2014 and if long-term contracts with U.S. suppliers are secured \u2014 this won\u2019t just be a temporary shift,\" she said. \"It will be a structural realignment.\"",
      "At the time of Trump\u2019s first warnings, many European leaders dismissed them. German officials defended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, insisting that trade would keep Russia tied to the West. Now, those same governments are racing to secure American supply as U.S. LNG terminals along the Gulf Coast operate at record capacity.",

      "As the U.S. cements its role as Europe\u2019s primary gas supplier, Russia\u2019s grip on the continent\u2019s energy market continues to weaken. \"Russia used to offer big discounts to keep buyers hooked, but as global production surges, it will have limited flexibility to compete,\" Sabadus said. \"U.S. LNG will become very competitive in Europe.\"",

      "The Trump administration has moved quickly to capitalize on the shift. It lifted a pause on LNG export approvals earlier this year, approved new production projects in Louisiana and Texas, and pushed for a U.S.\u2013E.U. energy framework under which European buyers have pledged to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars in American energy over the coming decades. Officials point to a string of recent long-term contracts \u2014 including Venture Global\u2019s deals with Italy and Germany over the summer, Greece\u2019s agreement announced last week, and a newly signed contract between Spain\u2019s Naturgy and Venture Global \u2014 as evidence that the \"energy dominance\" agenda is reshaping global trade flows.",
      "Rob Jennings, vice president for natural gas markets at the American Petroleum Institute, said the policy shift has unleashed a wave of investment and confirmed strong demand for U.S. LNG.",
      "\"Five facilities have made their final investment decisions in the first nine months of this year, totaling about 50 million metric tons per year of new capacity \u2014 more than $50 billion in investment,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"It\u2019s a really strong signal from the market.\"",
      "Jennings said the growth in exports benefits both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "\"Since 2016, the cumulative GDP impact of the U.S. LNG industry is about $400 billion, and over the next 15 years it could add another $1.3 trillion,\" he said. \"At the same time, more than two-thirds of U.S. LNG exports now go to Europe every single day, replacing the gas they once bought from Russia.\"",
      "Still, industry officials warn that regulatory differences could complicate future trade. Jennings pointed to two new European policies \u2014 the E.U. methane regulation and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive \u2014 that U.S. producers say could impose foreign standards on American companies.",
      "\"Those rules are effectively Europe trying to impose its own standards globally,\" he said. \"We hope that can be addressed as part of the trade deal, because there\u2019s a risk they could undermine Europe\u2019s commitment to buy more U.S. energy.\"",

But for now, the combination of abundant U.S. supply and new demand from coal-to-gas transitions has created what Sabadus called \"a good alignment.\"",
      "\"We\u2019re entering a buyer\u2019s market now,\" she said. \"There\u2019s abundant U.S. LNG supply, and new pockets of demand are emerging in Eastern Europe as countries move from coal to gas.\""

So this is a rather convoluted way to achieve the goals of a carbon tax. The people who use the products pay for the damage that they cause.\"",

      "Bookbinder told Fox News Digital that his remarks \"were meant to describe the way the oil and gas industry operates, not to endorse the way it operates,\" adding that his comments were made in a personal capacity as a longtime \"watchdog of the industry.\"",
      "He argued that \"fake outrage over these comments from oil and gas lobbyists\" was similar to tactics used by the old tobacco lobby to \"deny, spin, and overcharge customers, then blame the whistleblowers who say there\u2019s a problem.\"",
      "\"Big Oil CEOs, along with their business partners in the states, know that their product is harmful to the public and to the health of the American people. And those Big Oil CEOs and their agents in the states should pay the price for that, not the average American consumer at the pump. American consumers know it\u2019s a cold hard fact that multinational oil companies look for any excuse they can find to stick it to the public at the gas pump with high prices,\" he told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement.",
      "\"These Big Oil CEOs are opportunistic and ruthless, and that means pain for consumers and our planet, no matter how many advertisements they run trying to whitewash the damage their product causes, and the costs to taxpayers and the public result from that damage.\"",
      "Bookbinder continued that he \"was not saying that tort liability should actually be an indirect carbon tax.\"",
      "\"I was lamenting the fact that multinational oil CEOs and their counterparts in the states will always double down against the interests of the American consumer by hitting consumers with a harmful product and high prices, unless Congress takes action, which it has not,\" he continued.",
      "\"That\u2019s a problem for both parties. Gas prices become a political football because neither party has found the courage to stand up to the oil and gas lobby.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think American consumers should pay the price twice for the damage being done to our health and our planet by oil and gas companies, but sadly, that\u2019s the way it happens right now in America. And that\u2019s the way it will continue to happen unless members of both parties in Congress get back to work and figure this out.\"",

      "CJP said at the time that the forum was established to facilitate communications between members of its Judicial Leaders in Climate Science program, adding that CJP's programs are \"no different than the work of other continuing judicial education organizations that address important complex topics, including medicine, tech and neuroscience.\"",

      "The dream of personal flight has always felt just out of reach, until now. A company called AltoVolo has unveiled something that might make it real: the world's first eVTOL configurator.",
      "That might sound technical, but it's actually simple. \"eVTOL\" stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing. Think of a small, quiet aircraft that lifts off like a helicopter but flies forward like a plane, all powered by electric or hybrid engines instead of noisy fuel-burning ones.",
      "And a configurator? It's a tool that lets you design your own version online, choosing colors, materials and other personal details. Put the two together, and you've got something quite remarkable: the ability to design your own flying vehicle from your laptop.",

      "With AltoVolo\u2019s world-first online configurator, you can design every detail of your Sigma eVTOL. (AltoVolo)",
      "A new kind of personal aircraft",
      "AltoVolo's aircraft is called the Sigma, and it's unlike anything on the market. It's a three-seater hybrid-electric vehicle that combines quiet operation with long range. The Sigma can fly about 500 miles, reach speeds over 220 mph and is more than 80% quieter than a helicopter.",
      "That quietness isn't just about comfort; it's what makes urban air travel possible. Imagine small aircraft quietly taking off from rooftops or open fields, connecting cities and towns without the noise pollution we associate with helicopters today.",
      "Safety is built in, too. The Sigma can keep flying even if one of its small electric jet engines fails, and it carries a ballistic parachute for emergencies. It's compact and light, just under 16 feet wide and weighing a little over 2,100 pounds, making it easier to operate and store than you might expect.",
      "The Sigma is over 80% quieter than a helicopter combining sleek hybrid-electric power with quiet performance. (AltoVolo)",
      "From concept to customization",
      "The idea of customizing your own aircraft might sound futuristic, but AltoVolo's online configurator makes it surprisingly accessible.",
      "Like building your own car online, you can choose colors, seat materials, interior details and even the stitching on your seatbelts. Founder and CEO Will\u00a0Wood says the company's goal isn't to compete on price but on experience and technology.",
      "\"Much like you'd expect from a supercar brand, we're focused on performance and refinement,\" he explained.",
      "The first 100 Sigma models will be limited editions, offering special finishes and materials that won't appear on later production units.",
      "NASA'S 'QUIET' SUPERSONIC JET COMPLETES FIRST FLIGHT IN POTENTIAL BREAKTHROUGH FOR COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL",
      "Taking flight before you take off",
      "AltoVolo isn't stopping at online design. They've built a high-fidelity flight simulator that mirrors the Sigma's cockpit exactly, right down to its carbon fiber and soft leather interior.",
      "Customers can train in the simulator and even use those hours toward a pilot's license. The simulator gives them a chance to \"fly\" their customized Sigma before ever leaving the ground.",
      "And for everyone else? The company is sharing flight footage from its simulator on YouTube, so people can see how the Sigma handles in the air.",
      "\"For AltoVolo, opening our order book is a major milestone in bringing the Sigma to life,\" Wood tells CyberGuy. \"Having early customers make an initial financial commitment shows us real demand. In turn, we are able to raise capital to finalise the product, progress certification and prepare for production. Presenting the flight simulator has been a useful catalyst. Allowing customers to fly in a simulated environment really helps them realise how easy this type of aircraft will be to fly.\"",
      "An exclusive community for early Sigma owners shapes the future of personal air travel and sustainable innovation. (AltoVolo)",
      "Innovation you can feel",
      "One of the most interesting details about the Sigma is something you can't see: the sound inside the cabin. AltoVolo's engineers are working to reduce vibration and interior noise, creating a calm, smooth flight experience.",
      "At the same time, they're experimenting with a synthesized soundscape, a gentle background tone that changes with the aircraft's power use. It helps pilots sense how the vehicle is performing and adds a cinematic touch to the flying experience.",
      "It's part science, part art and a hint at how human-centered this design really is.",
      "Future pilots can train in a realistic Sigma cockpit simulator and even log hours toward a license. (AltoVolo)",
      "The path to certification",
      "The Sigma will benefit from new U.S. aviation rules called MOSAIC, which simplify the process for certifying small, advanced aircraft. This means the Sigma can be sold as a light sport aircraft, lowering costs for both the company and future pilots. Certification is also underway in Europe and the UK, which could make global operations possible in the next few years.",
      "Building a community around flight",
      "Buying a Sigma isn't just about owning an aircraft; it's about joining a new kind of community. AltoVolo wants Sigma owners to become collaborators, helping to shape the product and the future of urban flight. The company is also planning a global service and support network, including maintenance and training centers, to make ownership practical for people beyond traditional aviation circles.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For most of us, flying still means boarding a big plane at a crowded airport. But companies like AltoVolo are trying to change that. The Sigma represents a future where small, efficient aircraft could handle regional travel, connecting towns, suburbs and cities in new ways. It's the kind of innovation that could one day make air travel as personal as driving. And while it's still very early, AltoVolo's new configurator makes the dream of personal air travel feel a bit more real.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AltoVolo's Sigma may not replace your car anytime soon, but it gives us a glimpse of what's coming: a world where flight is cleaner, quieter and designed around the individual. It's a preview of how the future of travel might not be on the road at all, but instead in the air.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 07:36:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Electric vehicles overtake gas cars in total CO2 savings after just two years of driving, with emissions benefits growing over time as power grids get cleaner.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses how President Donald Trump bought a red Tesla at the White House and Democrats' reaction to it on \u2018Jesse Watters Primetime.\u2019",
      "Electric vehicles are proving their worth when it comes to long-term emissions. While building an EV creates more pollution upfront because battery production demands more energy, the balance changes fast once the car is on the road. After about two years of normal driving, an electric car overtakes a gas-powered one in total CO2 savings and keeps widening the gap over time.",
      "A peer-reviewed study published in\u00a0PLOS Climate supports this finding. Researchers Pankaj Sadavarte, Drew Shindell, and Daniel Loughlin conducted the analysis titled,\u00a0\"Comparing the climate and air pollution footprints of Lithium-ion BEVs and ICEs in the U.S. incorporating systemic energy system responses.\" Their work examined how manufacturing, fuel production and vehicle operation affect both climate and air quality over a vehicle's lifetime.",
      "POWER ON THE MOVE: IS PILOT PROGRAM THE FUTURE OF EV CHARGING?",

      "New research from PLOS Climate shows electric cars surpass gas vehicles in total CO2 savings after just two years on the road. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the study shows EVs overtake gas cars in emissions",
      "Using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), the study simulated how U.S. transportation and energy systems interact through 2050 under different rates of EV adoption. The results show that while manufacturing EVs releases about 30% more CO2 than producing gas cars, that gap closes quickly once you drive. By the end of year two, EVs emit less carbon overall, and the advantage widens over time as the power grid shifts toward cleaner energy sources.",
      "Each additional kilowatt-hour of battery capacity is projected to eliminate roughly 485 pounds of CO2 by 2030 and about 280 pounds by 2050. That reflects continued progress in electricity generation and efficiency gains across the EV industry. Over an estimated 18-year lifespan, gas-powered vehicles produce two to three and a half times more pollution-related damage than electric ones. Those damages include the social and economic costs of climate change and health issues linked to air pollution.",
      "While building EV batteries creates more emissions upfront, cleaner power grids and zero tailpipe output help electric vehicles pull ahead over time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the GCAM model works",
      "The GCAM model links global energy use, economic activity, and emissions across multiple sectors. In this analysis, researchers measured not only tailpipe emissions but also the upstream effects from mining, refining, and fuel processing. They also factored in how growing EV adoption changes the energy mix. As electricity demand rises, cleaner energy sources like wind, solar and nuclear expand their share, while coal steadily declines.",
      "By 2050, electricity generation from gas, wind and solar grows while coal falls below 6% of the total mix. This cleaner grid makes charging electric cars progressively less carbon-intensive, strengthening the case for a large-scale EV transition.",
      "The study found lifetime health and climate damages from gas cars can be up to 3.5 times higher than from EVs, underscoring the long-term benefits of going electric. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How EVs impact you and the environment",
      "If you keep a car for more than two years, switching to an EV can meaningfully reduce your carbon footprint. The study found that EVs start paying back their manufacturing emissions faster in regions with renewable-heavy grids. In states still dependent on coal, the break-even point arrives later but still occurs well before a car's third birthday. The cleaner your local power mix, the faster your EV moves into net-positive territory.",
      "INHALERS PRODUCE CARBON EMISSIONS EQUAL TO 530,000 CARS ON ROAD ANNUALLY, STUDY FINDS",
      "The findings also highlight public health benefits. Gas vehicles emit more nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, both of which contribute to respiratory illnesses and smog. As EVs replace traditional engines, these pollutants drop, improving air quality and reducing healthcare costs.",
      "Context and limitations",
      "The authors acknowledge that their analysis does not include emissions from recycling or disposing of vehicle parts at the end of life. Nor does it count emissions from building charging networks or new power infrastructure. Despite those exclusions, the study provides one of the most comprehensive long-term looks at how EV adoption affects both the economy and the environment.",
      "Because the study uses projections through 2050, results depend on future technology and energy trends. Even so, the consistent pattern across all scenarios is that EVs deliver large reductions in CO2 and air pollutants once on the road.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you drive often and plan to own your car for several years, the data shows an EV can save both emissions and money over time. Charging on a renewable or low-carbon plan speeds the payoff even more. Choosing a vehicle that matches your driving needs helps minimize unnecessary battery production and further reduces your footprint.",
      "For communities, broader EV adoption means cleaner local air, fewer health-related costs and lower long-term damage from climate change.",

The authors note that the analysis does not include emissions from recycling or charging infrastructure, yet it remains one of the most thorough long-term views of EV adoption and its effects on the economy and environment.",

    "story": [
      "Pete Nicoletti, chief information security officer at Check Point, told Fox News Digital that an FBI-warned scam is now using AI to target seniors.",
      "When Joe A. from Shelton, Connecticut, received a text about a crypto investment opportunity, he thought it was his chance to rebuild after a divorce. Instead, he lost every dollar he had. Joe's story is a heartbreaking reminder of how easy it is to fall for an online investment scam that promises quick success and easy money.",
      "Joe has allowed Cyberguy to tell his powerful story so that others can learn from his experience and protect themselves from similar scams. Here is how it all went down and how you can protect yourself from falling into the same trap.",

      "HOW TO STOP IMPOSTOR BANK SCAMS BEFORE THEY DRAIN YOUR WALLET",
      "After his account access vanished, scammers allegedly demanded more cash to \"reactivate\" it. By then, Joe\u2019s retirement savings were wiped out. (Gabby Jones/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How the online investment scam began",
      "In August, Joe got a message from a company calling itself\u00a0\"ZAP Solutions.\" It promised that if he invested $30,000, he'd soon have $368,000 in returns. It sounded like a smart move. Like many victims, Joe believed the pitch because it seemed professional and legitimate.",
      "But soon he was led deeper into a trap. Each \"short-term investment\" required another wire transfer. Before he knew it, Joe had sent every penny, his 401K, IRA and other investments.",
      "When the investment scam fell apart",
      "The moment Joe was locked out of his account, panic set in. The scammers demanded more money to \"reactivate\" it. By the end, Joe had lost $228,000.",
      "His mother, Carol, was devastated when she found out.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" she said. \"He showed us the screenshots, the messages. He emptied everything.\"",
      "Joe and his family filed a police report with local authorities and contacted the FBI. But, according to officers, recovery is unlikely.",
      "\"They told us there's no way to get it back,\" Carol said. \"These cyberstalkers move the money too fast.\"",
      "The bigger picture: Online investment scams are rising",
      "Joe's story isn't unique. The FBI reports that cybercriminals have stolen more than $50 billion from Americans in just five years. Scammers prey on emotion, targeting people who are hopeful, lonely or in transition.",
      "\"If it seems too good to be true, it probably is,\" Joe said, stating a phrase we all should remember.",
      "How to protect yourself from online investment scams",
      "Staying safe starts with awareness and consistent action. Cybercriminals are getting more creative, so protecting your finances means staying alert every step of the way. Follow these proven steps to safeguard your accounts and identity.",
      "Always verify any investment opportunity before sending money. Look up the company through official government or financial websites, such as the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure database or FINRA's BrokerCheck. Read reviews, confirm licenses and search for scam alerts online.",
      "If a text, email or social media message promises high returns, stop and think. Legitimate firms never cold-contact people about investment offers. Delete suspicious messages immediately and never click on links from unknown sources. Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. This can block phishing attempts, malicious downloads, and fake investment platforms designed to steal your data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Scammers often use domains that look almost identical to real ones. Double-check for misspellings, extra letters or unusual web extensions like \".co\" or \".biz.\" If you're unsure, search for the official company site separately in your browser.",
      "Once you wire money to a scammer, recovery is nearly impossible. Never send money to someone you've only met online, even if they claim to represent a reputable company. Always confirm payment details through verified sources.",
      "Before you invest large sums, get a second opinion from a licensed financial advisor. A professional can spot red flags and unrealistic promises that you might overlook.",
      "Protect your personal information by using a data removal or privacy service that scrubs your phone number, address and other details from people search sites. This reduces the chance of scammers finding and targeting you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the Internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Joe's story is painful, but it's also powerful. His honesty may stop someone else from losing everything. Online scams thrive when people stay silent, but sharing stories like Joe's helps others stay alert. So, before you trust anyone promising quick profits online, take a pause, verify everything and remember Joe's story because one moment of caution could save you from a lifetime of regret.",

    "story": [
      "AI-powered driving will help with a growing shortage of drivers, rising costs and relentless demand for faster deliveries.",
      "A new chapter in trucking has begun. Waabi, the leader in physical artificial intelligence, has revealed a major milestone in autonomous trucking, integrating the Waabi Driver with the Volvo VNL Autonomous. Together, these technologies mark a major step toward delivering an autonomous solution that is safe and supports broad commercial deployment.",

      "AI TRUCK SYSTEM MATCHES TOP HUMAN DRIVERS IN MASSIVE SAFETY SHOWDOWN WITH PERFECT SCORES",
      "Waabi integrates its Waabi Driver with Volvo\u2019s VNL Autonomous, signaling a push toward safe, scalable Level 4 trucking. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "How this AI-powered autonomous truck was built for scale",
      "In early 2025, Waabi and Volvo Autonomous Solutions announced a long-term partnership to develop and deploy autonomous trucks.",
      "Volvo's New River Valley plant in Virginia is producing the VNL Autonomous with six critical redundant or back-up systems \u2014 including dual braking, steering, communication, computing, power, energy storage and motion control \u2014 which are key to safe operations without a driver in the seat.",
      "Waabi provides the Waabi Driver, an end-to-end AI model that learns from experience and adapts to new conditions. The company also uses its advanced simulator, Waabi World, to expose the AI to millions of realistic driving situations before it reaches the road. Waabi calls this approach \"physical AI,\" which allows it to generalize across different environments safely.",
      "\"The future of autonomous trucking depends on technology that is safe, scalable, and built for customer needs,\" said Raquel Urtasun, Founder and CEO of Waabi.\u00a0\"Together with Volvo and NVIDIA, we're leading autonomous freight into a safer and more efficient era.\"",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "Volvo\u2019s New River Valley plant builds the VNL Autonomous with six redundant systems to enable driverless operations. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "Why the AI-powered autonomous truck matters for freight",
      "The U.S. freight market continues to face growing demand and a shortage of qualified drivers. AI-powered autonomous trucks offer one of the most promising solutions to keep goods moving. By integrating the self-driving technologies of partners like Aurora Innovation and Waabi into the Volvo VNL Autonomous on the pilot line at its New River Facility in Virginia, Volvo Autonomous Solutions is able to deliver autonomous trucks with OEM-grade quality and consistency.",
      "Nils Jaeger, President of Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said the partnership is helping build the broader ecosystem needed for commercial deployment.",
      "\"Autonomy has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in the transport industry, including safety, efficiency and capacity,\" he said.",
      "The collaboration also draws strength from NVIDIA's computing platform.",
      "\"Self-driving is one of the first frontiers in which we will see physical AI become a reality,\" said Rishi Dhall, Vice President of Automotive at NVIDIA.\u00a0\"Our purpose-built compute platform complements Waabi's pioneering end-to-end verifiable trucking system, and it's coming to life on the VNL Autonomous. Level 4 autonomy in trucking is happening now.\"",
      "Concerns and challenges facing AI-powered trucks",
      "Despite the excitement, driverless freight faces real challenges. Safety remains the top concern as trucks encounter unpredictable weather, road debris and human drivers. While simulation can prepare AI for millions of events, regulators are still defining how to certify systems for nationwide deployment.",
      "The shift toward automation also raises economic questions. Trucking employs millions of drivers across the United States, and experts predict that job roles will evolve as fleets adopt autonomous systems. Labor groups and state officials are calling for retraining programs to help workers transition into new positions that support automation.",
      "Data privacy and cybersecurity are growing priorities, too. These trucks depend on constant cloud connectivity, which makes them potential targets for hackers.",
      "Public perception could also influence how fast adoption moves. Many people like the idea of innovation but hesitate to share the road with fully autonomous vehicles. Building trust will require transparency, safety trials and a strong performance record on open highways.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Volvo and Waabi say their integrated platform targets broad commercial deployment as U.S. freight demand grows. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "What comes next for the AI-powered autonomous truck",
      "Volvo and Waabi have already completed the integration of the Waabi Driver with the Volvo VNL Autonomous. The companies describe this milestone as a key step toward Level 4 autonomous operation, meaning the truck will be able to drive itself without human intervention under defined conditions.",
      "This collaboration builds on Volvo Group Venture Capital's early investment in Waabi in 2023 and its later participation in Waabi's $200 million Series B funding round in 2024. That support helped set the stage for this integration and for future broad commercial deployment.",
      "Shahrukh Kazmi, Chief Product Officer at Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said Waabi's technology fits perfectly into Volvo's platform.",
      "\"We are excited to integrate Waabi's cutting-edge system into our autonomous truck and jointly develop a safe, efficient, and scalable transport solution,\" he said.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you depend on deliveries or shop online, driverless freight could soon shape how products reach your home. These AI-powered trucks can operate longer hours than human drivers, reducing shipping delays and potentially lowering transportation costs.",
      "Automation could also make highways safer by cutting down on fatigue-related crashes. With fewer disruptions from freight incidents, travel may become smoother for everyone sharing the road.",
      "This collaboration highlights how artificial intelligence is moving from theory to production lines and changing the way goods move across America.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here:\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The road ahead for self-driving freight looks both exciting and uncertain. The progress made by AI-powered trucks shows how far automation has come in solving real challenges like driver shortages and delivery delays. At the same time, it sparks debate about safety, employment and trust in technology. As this shift continues, clear communication and responsible testing will help the public feel more confident sharing the road with these trucks. Change is already rolling out, and how we respond today will define the future of transportation.",

      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Russian state-backed hackers have stepped up their game with new malware families that hide behind fake CAPTCHA tests. The group, known as Star Blizzard or ColdRiver, now uses ClickFix attacks to trick people into launching dangerous malware disguised as a simple \"I'm not a robot\" check.",
      "These attacks represent a new wave of cyber deception, targeting governments, journalists and NGOs with malware that keeps changing faster than researchers can analyze it.",

      "The ClickFix trap: A new kind of social engineering",
      "Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) first observed the hackers using LostKeys malware in espionage operations. Once researchers exposed it, the attackers pivoted quickly, abandoning LostKeys within a week and deploying new tools: NoRobot, YesRobot and MaybeRobot.",
      "NORTH KOREAN HACKERS USE AI TO FORGE MILITARY IDS",
      "The ClickFix attack works like this: a victim lands on a fake CAPTCHA page that looks identical to the real thing. When they click to prove they're human, the system silently runs NoRobot, infecting the computer and establishing persistence via registry changes and scheduled tasks.",
      "A fake \"I\u2019m not a robot\" CAPTCHA can launch hidden malware in seconds. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Inside the Russian \"robot\" malware chain",
      "The Russian hackers built their latest attack around a chain of connected malware families that unfold step by step once a victim clicks the fake CAPTCHA.",
      "NoRobot acts as the first stage of infection. It prepares the environment by downloading files, modifying registry keys and creating tasks to ensure it stays active even after a reboot.",
      "The hackers briefly tested YesRobot, a Python-based backdoor, but dropped it quickly after realizing the full Python installation drew unwanted attention from defenders.",
      "3,000+ YOUTUBE VIDEOS DELIVER MALWARE DISGUISED AS FREE SOFTWARE",
      "MaybeRobot replaced YesRobot as a stealthier PowerShell-based tool. It can download and execute payloads, run command prompts, and send stolen data back to the attackers. Researchers say MaybeRobot's development has now stabilized, allowing the hackers to focus on refining NoRobot's stealth.",
      "How these attacks keep evolving",
      "Security analysts noticed the malware's delivery chain has shifted several times. At one point, it became\u00a0\"drastically simplified,\" only to grow complex again as the attackers began splitting cryptographic keys across multiple files. This strategy makes it harder for researchers to reconstruct how infections work. Without every piece of the puzzle, the final malware payload cannot be decrypted correctly.",
      "Who's being targeted by the Russian malware",
      "ColdRiver's operations have been linked to the Russian intelligence service (FSB), with years of activity focused on espionage and data theft. The group has consistently targeted Western governments, think tanks, media organizations and NGOs to steal sensitive information and gain strategic insight.",
      "Despite sanctions, infrastructure takedowns and public exposure, the hackers continue to evolve. Their quick shift from LostKeys to NoRobot and MaybeRobot shows a highly organized and well-funded operation capable of retooling within days.",

      "These practical steps can help you protect your data and devices from the growing wave of Russian malware using fake CAPTCHA pages to spread.",
      "Fake \"I'm not a robot\" pages are the main lure in this Russian malware campaign. If you're redirected to a CAPTCHA on an unfamiliar site or after clicking a suspicious link, stop immediately. Real CAPTCHAs usually appear only on trusted websites, not random pop-ups or login pages. When in doubt, close the page and verify the URL before taking any action.",
      "Choose reputable antivirus protection that not only scans for known malware but also monitors suspicious behavior. Since the \"Robot\" malware evolves rapidly, behavior-based detection helps stop new variants before signature updates are available. Enable automatic updates and schedule daily scans to catch infections early. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "META ACCOUNT SUSPENSION SCAM HIDES FILEFIX MALWARE",
      "Many cyberattacks begin with publicly available data. Using a data removal or privacy protection service helps eliminate your personal information from data broker sites. By reducing what hackers can find online, you make it harder for them to tailor phishing emails or social engineering traps that lead to malware infection.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "The malware used in these attacks exploits known security flaws in unpatched systems. Always apply updates as soon as they're released. Turn on automatic updates for your browser, antivirus and operating system. Outdated software is one of the easiest entry points for Russian hackers and other advanced groups.",
      "Cyber experts say awareness is the best defense as these evolving attacks target both organizations and everyday users. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI FLAW LEAKED GMAIL DATA BEFORE OPENAI PATCH",

      "A ransomware payload could be the next evolution of this malware family. Back up critical data to both an external drive and cloud storage.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The rise of these Russian malware campaigns is a reminder that cybercriminals are always one step ahead. What looks like a harmless \"I'm not a robot\" test can actually hide a serious threat. Protecting yourself isn't just about having antivirus software; it's about staying alert to small online details that can make a big difference. Keep your devices updated, question unexpected pop-ups, and use trusted tools to guard your personal information.

Communities from coast to coast may soon face the same discussions about safety, surveillance and trust that Miami residents are having today. People will need to decide what balance they want between innovation and privacy and how technology should support public safety.",
      "As the pilot continues, community participation will matter more than ever. Residents, civic leaders and advocacy groups can shape how this technology develops by speaking up about clear rules, fair data use and transparency.

Scams involving criminals pretending to be bank representatives have surged, with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reporting record-breaking losses exceeding $2.9 billion in recent data.

      "Why you and others are targets",
      "Banks are trusted institutions, and scammers know it. That trust makes impersonation one of the easiest and most effective fraud tactics today. With\u00a0spoofing tools, criminals can mimic real bank phone numbers and even use AI to reproduce familiar voices. Their approach is psychological: they create panic and urgency to make victims act quickly and irrationally.",

The FTC found that losses of over $100,000 to impostor scams among people aged 60 and older have skyrocketed, from $55 million in 2020 to $445 million in 2024.

But you can fight back with knowledge and caution. Stay alert every time your phone rings or your inbox pings. Slow down before you react. Verify before you trust. The few seconds you take to double-check could be what saves your life savings. Remember, even the most tech-savvy people fall for scams when emotions take over. The real key to protection isn't fear, it's awareness and action. Share what you know with friends, family and coworkers.

      "On Veterans Day, T2T Chairman & CEO Frank Siller announced the delivery of 25 mortgage-free homes to Gold Star widows whose loved ones died protecting our country.",
      "On Veterans Day, Tunnel to Towers Foundation Chairman and CEO Frank Siller sat down with Fox Nation host Abby Hornacek to announce a spectacular commitment: the delivery of 25 mortgage-free homes to Gold Star widows whose loved ones died protecting our country.",
      "Siller emphasized that the great sacrifice made by these men and women continues, noting that many are dying from service-related illnesses like burn pit cancers. He likened this continuing tragedy to the 9/11-related illnesses that still claim the lives of first responders, stressing that the Foundation must \"be here forever\" to care for these heroes.",
      "The core mission is rooted in a promise to protect the families of those who protect us. Siller shared the emotional privilege of calling these Gold Star widows himself to let them know their mortgage is paid off. He noted that this relief is transformative, allowing one widow to go back and get a nursing degree without the burden of working a second or third job.",
      "Reflecting on his brother Stephen's legacy of courage, Siller stressed that the Foundation \"can't rest.\" He urged Americans to join this crucial mission by visiting T2T.org and donating $11 a month to ensure these families are cared for."

      "According to Makovsky, Israel\u2019s campaign against those threats shows the alliance\u2019s strategic value. \"What did the Israelis just do? They took care of it. The United States came in with the B-2 at the very end\u2026 but it was Israel that did all that work,\" he said.",
      "He added that Israel \"pretty much finished off Hamas,\" weakened Hezbollah \u2014 \"which has hundreds of American soldiers\u2019 blood on their hands\" \u2014 and continues to confront the Houthis to \"ensure freedom of navigation.\" That, he argued, is deterrence in action: \"As long as we support Israel, we give them some help, we give them the weapons they need, they\u2019re really doing our work.\"",
      "Fleitz called Iran \"the biggest threat,\" encompassing \"Iran and Iran\u2019s proxies in the region. This includes Hamas, Hezbollah in Syria, Iran-backed militias in Iraq, and then Iran itself, with its nuclear weapons program and its sponsorship of terror.\"",
      "He said Israel\u2019s actions have \"destroyed Hamas proxies and significantly weakened Iran,\" adding that \"we joined Israel in June in taking on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which was a threat to global security.\"",
      "Both analysts framed Iran as part of a wider axis of power alongside Russia and China, each exploiting Middle East instability to undermine U.S. influence \u2014 by fueling proxy wars, spiking energy prices, and threatening trade routes through the Gulf and the Red Sea. Fleitz said Trump\u2019s willingness to act decisively \"to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program\" exemplified using strength to prevent costlier wars later.",

The attacks targeted multiple military, scientific and residential locations, as well as senior government officials. (Stringer/Getty Images)",
      "Both agree that energy policy is where America First becomes measurable. Fleitz said that \"energy independence is a very important part of President Trump\u2019s America First policy to free Americans from high energy bills.\" At the same time, he noted, energy diplomacy abroad reinforces economic security at home. \"By pushing the Saudis \u2014 and the Saudis, I think, are happy to help us with this \u2014 to produce more oil, it may actually help us end the war in Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "Makovsky made a similar case for regional stability: \"The biggest threat to the Gulf Arab oil exporters \u2026 is Iran,\" he said. Without Israel\u2019s containment of Tehran, \"Iran would have taken over the Middle East, most likely. And if you care about oil prices, that\u2019s not too good.\"",

      "Fleitz said Trump\u2019s doctrine is about selective force, not retreat. \"He wants to keep our country out of new and unnecessary wars, but he will use military force prudently to defend our national security,\" he said. \"He is going to avoid sending American troops into certain situations and using military force. But that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t do these things when it is in U.S. strategic interests.\"",
      "He pointed out U.S. personnel who are currently stationed in Israel but \"they\u2019re not going to Gaza\" and \"will not be engaging in combat operations against Hamas.\" Their mission, he said, fits the model of minimal footprint, maximum leverage.",
      "Makovsky warned that abandoning Israel would erode America\u2019s credibility worldwide. He recalled what a senior Arab leader once told him: \"If America doesn\u2019t help Israel attack the nuclear facilities of Iran, it will be one of the great catastrophes.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s because everybody in the Mideast, everyone in Asia, knows that the U.S.\u2013Israel relationship is one of the closest in the world,\" Makovsky said. \"If we don\u2019t help Israel, it undercuts our credibility. The Chinese and the Russians and the North Koreans know that if we\u2019re not going to support Israel, we\u2019re not going to help other allies \u2026 and it would make us more vulnerable to the Chinese without a doubt.\"",

      "One of the ways that trade policies and tariffs have made the gap between the U.S. and other indexes wider than it might otherwise be is by weakening the U.S. dollar.",
      "The sinking dollar has helped propel international indexes higher. As the dollar weakens, the values of foreign investments and stock returns rise by comparison. In turn, a rising or stronger dollar would dampen the relative return of money invested outside the U.S.",
      "The currency factor",
      "The Dollar Index, a measure of the U.S. currency\u2019s strength against a basket of foreign currencies such as the pound, yen, euro, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar, has sunk 9% since the start of 2025.",
      "The continued erosion in the dollar\u2019s value makes it more expensive for American companies and consumers to import goods, go on vacation or send money abroad.",
      "\u201cI see signs that the attraction of the dollar is slightly eroded, and [the] future will tell whether there is more erosion of that,\u201d European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told CBS News in October.",
      "\u201cFor a currency to be really trusted you need a few things,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need geopolitical credibility, you need the rule of law and strong institutions. And you need a military force that is strong enough.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think on at least one and possibly two accounts, the U.S. is still in a very dominant position,\u201d Lagarde continued. But the central banker warned that the U.S. \u201cneeds to be very careful because those positions erode over the course of time.\u201d",
      "Not everyone agrees.",
      "\u201cThe dollar\u2019s been on a pretty good run over a long period of time and it\u2019s certainly given back \u2014 this year given some of the policy actions \u2014 some of the gains, but fundamentally the dollar is the reserve currency of the world,\u201d Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said on Bloomberg Television on Oct. 30. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything at the moment that threatens that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s something to watch, but I\u2019m not concerned that there\u2019s some fundamental shift,\u201d Solomon said.",
      "CORRECTION: (Nov. 11, 2025, 6:17 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated how many times in the last 10 years the S&P 500 has not been the world\u2019s top performing stock index. It\u2019s the third time, not the second. And a graphic misstated the S&P\u2019s performance in 2022. It was negative 19.4%, not positive."

      "The series, whose first two episodes premiered on Nov. 7, tells the story of Carol Sturka (Rhea Seehorn), a grumpy romance-fantasy author who finds herself among the dozen or so people tasked with saving the world after an alien virus puts everyone else into a happy hive mind.",
      "\u201cPluribus\u201d was created by Vince Gilligan, the mastermind behind \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d His new series grapples with questions about humanity, technology and contentment: If the creepy hive mind \u2014 like Aldous Huxley\u2019s fictional soma drug in the classic dystopian novel \u201cBrave New World\u201d \u2014 makes everyone happier, maybe it\u2019s OK?",
      "Seehorn, a familiar face to Gilligan fans thanks to her breakout role as Kim Wexler in \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d brings her comic sensibilities to Carol, whose misanthropic nature makes her an odd candidate to save humanity.",
      "Gilligan sets the series in and around Albuquerque, New Mexico, the same setting as \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d Those fascinated by UFO folklore also know the general area as the home of the 1947 Roswell Incident.",
      "Read on to hear what critics and viewers have said so far about \u201cPluribus.\u201d",
      "What Have Critics Said About \u2018Pluribus\u2019?",
      "Since it debuted on Nov. 7, critics have raved about \u201cPluribus\u201d with many celebrating the continued collaboration between Gilligan and Seehorn.",
      "The show currently has a critic's rating of 100%.",
      "Linda Holmes of NPR called the show a \u201cbrutal watch\u201d at times, noting how \u201cCarol finds herself deep in grief, walking through empty buildings, driving deserted neighborhoods, experiencing the arid desolation of a frictionless life.",
      "\u201cBut the collaboration between Gilligan and Seehorn,\u201d Holmes continues, \u201calso is built on how funny she is, how perfectly suited to both his willingness to plumb deep wells of sadness and the playfulness.\u201d",
      "Joel Keller of Decider agreed the show\u2019s heaviness is offset by its playful tone, writing, \u201c\u2018Pluribus\u2019 is creepy and tension-filled and funny and dramatic and really weird.\u201d",
      "While several critics noted the pacing of \u201cPluribus\u201d can be slow at times, most, like Los Angeles Times critic Robert Lloyd, promised the show ultimately delivers.",
      "\u201cAfter quickly establishing the premise, Gilligan shifts into low gear; this is a slow series, yet never a boring one,\u201d writes Lloyd, adding, \u201cGreat tracts of time pass without dialogue. For most of the way it\u2019s Seehorn\u2019s show, and she\u2019s marvelous \u2014 running through a range of emotions, confused, clever, resigned and determined by turns, as she navigates (as they say in the comics) a world she never made, an angry person beating against a sea of contentment, a complicated person in a one-speed society.\u201d",
      "Nicholas Quah of Vulture also urged viewers to stick with the series, writing, \u201cYou owe it to yourself to give \u2018Pluribus\u2019 a chance. Something glorious is gestating inside this entrancing piece of television, and to experience its full effect, you have to trust the process.\u201d",
      "Chase Hutchinson of the Seattle Times praised the series for asking challenging questions.",
      "\u201cThe more it goes on, the more \u2018Pluribus\u2019 becomes a show of immense, urgent feeling, one that grapples with the terrors of growing numb to loss. It\u2019s about survival versus resistance, compliance versus conflict, fantasy versus reality, and whether a false happiness is worth losing all of who you were for.",
      "\u201cCarol is a bit of a grump,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut she\u2019s our grump, a graceful sliver of humanity\u2019s complexity in a world that\u2019s seeking to flatten it.\u201d",
      "What Have Fans Said About \u2018Pluribus\u2019?",
      "Fan reviews on Rotten Tomatoes have also been mostly glowing. The show currently boasts an 84% rating from audiences at home.",
      "\u201cVince Gilligan is the greatest TV writer/show runner of the Gen X cohort. The pilot is original, riveting, mysterious, funny and tragic, all at the same time. I cannot remember being so engaged in a story, at least since his last masterpiece, \u2018Better Call Saul,\u2019\u201d wrote one.",
      "\u201cI was hooked from the beginning. Kept up the pace. Kept up the excitement so far threw (sic) the first 2 episodes ... The acting is superb! Finally something exciting to watch! Thank you,\u201d another agreed.",

Rini\u2019s launch consisted of \"everyday\" face masks in the shape of a puppy, unicorn or panda, a hydrating hydrogel facial mask and an after-sun hydrogel facial mask. The facial sheets contain ingredients like vitamin E, vitamin B12 and aloe vera.",
      "Mitchell and Song say the products are intended \"to nurture healthy habits, spark confidence, and make thoughtfully crafted daily care essentials and play products accessible to every family.\"  The co-founders also claim that the brands' products are safe for toddlers as young as 3 years old.",
      "But the launch was met with some backlash online, with some claiming the products aren't needed for children's skin and project beauty standards onto kids.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to representatives for Mitchell and Rini for comment.",
      "What are consumers saying about the brand's launch and what do dermatologists think? We're breaking it all down below.",
      "What Is Rini?",
      "Shay Mitchell first teased her new company Rini on Instagram Nov. 5 by posting a photo of a child using a face mask. The company formally launched the next day.",
      "\"This has been three years in the making, inspired by my girls, their curiosity, and all the little moments that made me realize how early it starts. From birthday parties and face paint to wanting to do 'what mommy does' with her face masks\u2026 it was only a matter of time,\" Mitchell wrote on Instagram.",
      "Mitchell explained that she and her close friend and business partner Song specifically came up with the idea for the aloe vera recovery mask when they saw Song's daughter\u2019s skin after a day in the sun.",
      "\u201cI wanted something that worked, but was still clean enough for my kids and now it\u2019s finally here,\u201d Mitchell, who is a mom to 6-year-old Atlas and 3-year-old Rome, said. \u201cKids are naturally curious and instead of ignoring that, we can embrace it. With safe, gentle products parents can trust, and sweet moments that bring us closer.\u201d",
      "On Rini's website, they added that they \"created Rini because we wanted products that are gentle, trust-worthy, and inspire creativity.\"",
      "In a promotional video for Rini, Mitchell opened up about the experience of her own daughters wanting face masks that she thought were inappropriate.",
      "\"The ingredients in these masks are crazy. They actually shouldn\u2019t be used for kids at all,\" she said.",
      "A press release for the launch said that Rini's formulas were developed with pediatric chemists and labs in South Korea and the brand\u2019s \u201cproprietary formulas reflect the brand\u2019s \u2018rini promise\u2019 of transparency, safety, and quality to redefine play for Little Faces with Big Imaginations.\u201d",
      "The brand claims that its products are dermatologist-tested, EU-complaint, hypoallergenic, vegan and cruelty free.",
      "Why Rini Has Sparked Some Backlash",
      "Before the company formally launched on Nov. 6, Rini \u2014 and the imagery of a young girl using a face mask \u2014\u00a0sparked controversy.",
      "\"This feels beyond GRIM,\" one person commented on the Nov. 5 post.",
      "\"I\u2019m deeply disappointed. Why are we projecting beauty standards onto children now,\" another wrote.",
      "Other commenters expressed their concerns over the marketing of skin care toward young kids.",
      "\"Their skin needs recovery from what?\" one Instagram user said.",
      "\"The only face product a child needs is sunscreen, this is wild!\" another added.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m genuinely concerned by this. kids don\u2019t need hydrogel masks or actives. their skin barrier is already healthy and still developing. this kind of \u2018early skincare\u2019 marketing really blurs the line between care and consumerism. do better,\" a third wrote.",
      "Representatives for Mitchell did not respond to TODAY.com's request for comment by the time of publication.",
      "The Brand's Launch Is Part of a Growing Trend of Young 'Skinfluencers'",
      "In a segment that aired on TODAY on Nov. 10, NBC\u2019s Stephanie Gosk explored the rising trend of Gen Alpha's newfound passion for skin care.",
      "Many young \"skinfluencers\" have emerged on social media and built large followings by filming videos about their skin care routines and product faves.",
      "Naiya, an 11-year-old skinfluencer on TikTok, spoke to TODAY and said she's \"learned a lot about skin care and makeup\" by filming TikTok videos.",

      "Do Kids Need Skin Care Products? We Asked  Dermatologists",
      "TODAY.com spoke with two dermatologists to get their thoughts on the rising trend of child skin care. Here's what they had to say.",
      "Rini\u2019s website lists out the ingredients featured in the kids\u2019 skin care products. The after-sun face mask includes aloe vera and chamomile; the hydrating mask is made with vitamin B12, glycerin and red algae extract; and the \u201ceveryday\u201d mask features  vitamin E, white tremella mushroom and beta-glucan.",
      "Dermatologist Dr. Fatima Fahs, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of the practice Dermy Doc Institute, tells TODAY.com that kids \u201cdon\u2019t really need to be using any of these ingredients.\u201d",
      "That's because the derm says kids\u2019 skin is typically balanced on its own and \u201cnot problematic.\u201d",
      "Fahs says kids\u2019 skin \u201cneeds very basic things.\u201d Children\u2019s skin barriers are \u201calready very healthy and resilient,\u201d she adds.",
      "Aloe vera is a calming ingredient that can be used after sun exposure, she says. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps support the skin barrier, though she says it\u2019s not needed topically.",
      "Similarly, Fahs says that vitamin B12 is \u201cnot necessarily proven to have any topical benefits on the skin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt can reduce inflammation overall, but most kids are getting vitamin B12 in their normal diet, so it\u2019s not something that necessarily needs to be applied on the skin,\u201d Fahs says.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re already potentially pushing the agenda that kids\u2019 skin needs to be fixed, then we\u2019re potentially highlighting imperfections for kids at a really young age. ... It\u2019s kind of blurring the lines of self-care and promoting this idea that their skin is not already perfect,\u201d Fahs says.",
      "Rini was \u201ccreated for growing faces ... to hydrate, soothe and recover\u201c and is intended for kids ages 3 and up, according to the brand\u2019s product pages.",
      "Dr. Rosemarie Ingleton, a board-certified dermatologist, says parents don't need to rush their children into a skin care routine.",
      "\"At age 3, the only thing I think we should be considering is getting them into a little habit of being clean and just (hygienic),\" she says, adding that masks and scrubs aren't necessary for young children.",
      "Per Ingleton, children don't need to use preventative skin care products until the onset of puberty.",
      "\"Wait until there is an issue when their skin actually changes.  Then you are targeting their skin with specific products,\" she says.",
      "Fahs seconds that sentiment and advises parents to consider introducing a skin care routine once their kids start to show signs of puberty in their pre-teen years.",
      "At this stage, children might notice an increase in oiliness in their skin, or \u201clittle bumps on the skin toward the end of the day.\u201d Generally, this change can occur between the ages of 8 and 13, with 8 being on the earlier side, Fahs says.",
      "\u201cIntroducing a gentle cleanser, a gentle moisturizer and a broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen is a great routine to encourage,\u201d Fahs says. \u201cIf I see patients in the office starting to have these changes, the very first thing I\u2019ll try to get them into the habit of doing is just washing their face with a gentle cleanser daily. Sometimes that\u2019s all they need.\u201d",
      "Overall, Fahs says she is seeing more marketing geared toward children, \u201cwhether that\u2019s intentional or not,\u201d and is seeing children come into her clinic \u201cwith more reactive skin barriers now or with problems they didn\u2019t have before starting a routine.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough I\u2019m all for healthy routines and habit building, especially in children, this almost takes it to the next level where it becomes harmful,\u201d she says.",
      "Fahs says that children's skin \u201cisn\u2019t just like a smaller version of adult skin.\u201d Rather, it is already \u201cnaturally balanced.\u201d",
      "\u201cChildren don\u2019t need these seven step routines, or these complicated products,\u201d Fahs says. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking to do some healthy habit building for your kids, the number one thing should just be encouraging them to wear a daily sunscreen before going outside to play.\u201d",
      "She adds, \u201cA lot of this is being disguised in this idea of self-care, but I find that self-care for children is encouraging them to go outside and play or be with their friends, and it\u2019s not standing in front of the mirror or putting on a sheet mask.\u201d",
      "During a live segment on TODAY on Nov. 10, NBC\u2019s Stephanie Gosk said the dermatologists she spoke to suggested avoiding skin care products with harsh ingredients, including retinol, fragrance and artificial dyes. They also suggested steering clear of scrubs, which can irritate skin.",
      "The dermatologists Gosk spoke to recommended seeking out products that say they're dermatologist-tested, hypoallergenic, calming and gentle. Ingredients like oatmeal, aloe vera and chamomile are good.",
      "\"But again, it is a conversation with your kids about what they actually need. And remember that they are going to see this stuff, so you do have to talk about it probably,\" she said."

      "Who Was John Wayne Gacy?",
      "Born in 1942 in Chicago, John Wayne Gacy was a building contractor who also dressed as \"Pogo the Clown\" for children's parties.",
      "According to History.com, he had a relatively normal middle-class upbringing, though there were accounts that he had an abusive alcoholic father. He got married in 1964 to Marlynn Myers, whose father owned a couple of Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises in Waterloo, Iowa. As seen in \"Devil in Disguise,\" Gacy managed one of the restaurants. He was later charged and sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting one of his male employees in 1968. He was released early due to good behavior.",
      "Gacy and Myers had two children together, Michael and Christine, before they divorced following his charges.",
      "After his release, he moved back to Chicago and remarried Carole Hoff. Once there, he started his construction business and clown work.",
      "What Did John Wayne Gacy Do?",
      "From 1972 to 1978, Gacy lured young men and boys, oftentimes for sex before murdering them and burying them in his home's crawl space.",
      "His murders would go undetected for years until December 1978 when police started investigating the disappearance of 15-year-old teenager named Robert Piest.",
      "How Did John Wayne Gacy Get Caught?",
      "Robert Piest was last seen with Gacy. \u201cDevil in Disguise\u201d shows how he would lure young men with hopes of a construction job, taking him to his home before he killed them.",
      "Piest went missing on his mother Elizabeth Piest's birthday, when he never returned home for dinner.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot out there about Elizabeth, which is good for the Piest family, which I think really valued their privacy,\u201d Ireland tells TODAY.com about portraying the victim\u2019s mother. \u201cFor me, I focused on just telling a story of a woman who was going through this very sudden and intense grief.\u201d",
      "Police began to look into Gacy after learning of his prior conviction. After obtaining a search warrant for his Norwood Park home, they discovered a foul smell and items from other missing men.",
      "According to NBC Chicago, Gacy's then-lawyer Sam Amirante shared in his book \u201cJohn Wayne Gacy: Defending a Monster,\u201d that Gacy confessed to him that Robert Piest was dead and \u201che\u2019s in the Des Plaines River.\u201d",
      "Gacy would go on to detail each of his murders and where he buried or dumped the bodies.",
      "\u201cHe went on, murder by murder, piece by piece, burial by burial,\u201d Amirante wrote. \u201cHe wanted to prove that what he was saying was true. He wanted to take us to his house and show us the burial ground.\u201d",
      "In 1979, Gacy was arrested in Cook County, Illinois. Police continued to find bodies in Gacy's home, as well as the river where he said he disposed of the victims.",
      "What Happened to John Wayne Gacy?",
      "In March of 1980, Gacy was convicted of murdering 33 young men, who ranged from 14 to 21. He was sentenced to death and transferred to death row in the then-new downstate Menard Correctional Center, according to the Chicago Tribune.",
      "More victims continued to be identified as the months and years went by. In 1985, an appeal was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court, upholding Gacy's death sentence.",
      "Gacy was executed by lethal injection at Stateville Correctional Center in 1994.",

      "\u201cI really hope that (with this show) we can start to talk about changing the narrative around dehumanizing people who aren\u2019t like ourselves,\u201d Chernus says. \u201cI really think we are trying to, in a way, address the systemic biases that allowed Gacy to get away with this for so long. And there are still unidentified victims that I hope, in some way, maybe this show allows someone to call in a tip.\u201d",
      "The PD stated that after Gacy\u2019s arrest, they learned that some of his victims were never reported missing by their families. At the time, many were estranged from the victims or were unaware that they were missing.",

      "The Old Farmer's Almanac, based in New Hampshire, issued a news release on Nov. 7 clearing up any confusion by noting that it is \"still going strong.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",

      "\"First we want to tell everyone that this decision was very hard to make,\" Farmers' Almanac editor Sandi Duncan told TODAY.com in an email. \"The Almanac has been published each and every year since 1818 \u2014 even when the editor (Ray Geiger) was overseas serving in World War II.

      "\"However, readers now access information and answers differently, and the trajectory of newsstand sales made this decision necessary,\" she continued. \"The financial challenges of producing and distributing the Almanac in today\u2019s chaotic media environment, unfortunately lead to this decision.\"",
      "The 2026 Farmers' Almanac will be the final edition of a publication that began in 1818. It features weather forecasts, astronomy tidbits and predictions like the best days to ski, brew beer, plant tomatoes and view meteor showers.",

      "\"To remind people to stop and smell the roses,\" she said. \"To appreciate all the wonders of nature, to realize that there is so much we can learn from the natural world even if we live among concrete skyscrapers.\"",
      "The announcement left readers upset at the loss.",

    "story": [
      "Looking for a read to carry you through winter, or at least to Thanksgiving? Author C.J. Farley stopped by the 3rd Hour of TODAY on Nov. 7 to share the books that he's loving lately.",
      "Farley's next novel, \"Who Knows You by Heart,\" out Nov. 11, is a blisteringly relevant dystopia set in the world of Big Tech. Octavia Crenshaw is a coder and one of the few Black employees at the entertainment tech firm she just joined. Then she learns about the secret her company is hiding.",
      "Walter Isaacson, who wrote biographies of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, said it was \"the first great AI novel of our time, and it is unlikely to be surpassed anytime soon.\u201d",
      "Read on for his book recommendations.",
      "Best thriller",
      "\"All That We See or Seem\" by Ken Liu",
      "Farley calls \"All That We See or Seem\" a \"sci-fi spin on \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\"",
      "It's about a female hacker-detective searching for a missing performance artist who specializes in creating AI-enhanced dreams.",
      "\"The book is a page-turner, and the main character, Julia Z, has layers that are fascinating to see pulled back. But the ideas at the center of the book are what make it truly special,\" he says.",
      "Best romance",
      "\"An Academic Affair\" by Jodi McAllister",
      "In this romance, two academics fake a marriage so they can accept a joint appointment at a university.",
      "\"My wife Sharon reads one or more romance books a week, and my job as her husband is to keep her supplied with the best ones. Searching out great romance books for her inspired me to make the love scenes in my new novel even better,\" he says.",
      "This one stands out, he says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s about literary academics who are aware of all the tropes in romance stories even as they struggle through them.\"",
      "\"The book also has a great message: nobody should think they are too smart or too busy to fall in love.\"",
      "Best book to screen",
      "\"Hamnet\" by Maggie O'Farrell",
      "With the movie adaptation of \"Hamnet\" out at the end of November, Farley is recommending the novel, which is about William Shakespeare and his wife, Anne Hathaway, grieving the loss of their son Hamnet. It's this grief that scholars believe led to the creation of \"Hamlet.\"",
      "\"It takes a novelist to really fill in the blank spaces in the historical record and tell us how a guy who went through tumultuous times in his early married life channeled all that to create works like 'Hamlet,'\" he says.",
      "Best Thanksgiving read",
      "\"Simply More\" by Cynthia Erivo",
      "\"Wicked\" star Cynthia Erivo tells \"impactful, stripped-down stories about her life and family to inspire readers\" in this book, per Farley.",
      "\"Wicked: For Good\" hits theaters on Nov. 21, so get to know the woman behind the voice.",
      "What CJ's reading",
      "\"I, Medusa\" by Ayana Gray",
      "Medusa is misunderstood in this fantasy novel, which follows how a young woman became a cursed after a dalliance with the gods of Olympics.",
      "\"I love stories that find humanity in monsters and cause us to question our assumptions about who\u2019s good and who\u2019s bad. The Gods in this book, like Poseidon and Athena, are vain and merciless and take advantage of people,\" he says."

    "story": [
      "Fears over dependency on Chinese technology have reached an unlikely corner of the West: the previously serene and efficient world of Scandinavian public transportation.",
      "European nations have become increasingly worried that their vast amounts of Chinese-built infrastructure could be weaponized \u2014 tampered with, immobilized or even commandeered \u2014 if tensions were to rise with Beijing.",
      "Now, bus providers in Denmark and Norway say they are urgently investigating and remedying what they say is a security loophole discovered in their fleets of vehicles made by Yutong, a company based in Zhengzhou, China, that is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of buses by sales volume.",
      "Because these buses can receive updates and diagnostic tests \u201cover the air,\u201d they can be \u201cstopped remotely, either by the manufacturer or by a hacker,\u201d Jeppe Gaard, chief operating officer of the Danish public transport provider Movia, told NBC News in an email Wednesday.",
      "\u201cElectric buses, like electric cars, in principle can be remotely deactivated if their software systems have online access,\u201d he said. This isn\u2019t just a \u201cChinese bus concern; it is a challenge for all types of vehicles and devices with these kinds of electronics built in,\u201d Gaard added.",
      "In Denmark, Movia\u2019s fleet includes 262 Yutong buses, which have been phased in since 2019 across a network that covers the capital, Copenhagen, and the east of the country, Movia said.",
      "The alarm was first raised earlier this month by the Norwegian bus operator Ruter, which runs half of the country\u2019s public transport, including in Oslo, the capital.",
      "Ruter performed underground tests \u201cinside a mountain\u201d on two buses: the Yutong model and one from the Dutch manufacturer VDL.",
      "While the Dutch buses \u201cdo not have the capability for autonomous software updates over the air,\u201d Yutong \u201chas direct digital access to each individual bus for software updates and diagnostics,\u201d it said.",
      "In theory, \u201cthis bus can be stopped or rendered inoperable by the manufacturer,\u201d it said, although Yutong wouldn\u2019t be able to remotely drive these vehicles.",
      "Asked for comment on the Danish and Norwegian moves, Yutong sent an emailed statement saying that it \u201cunderstands and highly values the public\u2019s concerns regarding vehicle safety and data privacy protection,\u201d and \u201cstrictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.\u201d",
      "It said its vehicle data in the European Union is stored in an Amazon Web Services data center in Frankfurt, Germany, where it is \u201cprotected by storage encryption and access control measures,\u201d and that \u201cwithout customer authorization, no one is allowed to access or operate the system.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "This is just the latest episode in Europe\u2019s complex relationship with China: deeply reliant on Beijing\u2019s trade and increasing know-how, but critical of its alleged cyber-aggression, rampant intellectual property theft and human rights violations.",
      "Even as hope rises for a new trade agreement between China and the E.U., there are grave concerns over plans for a new mega-embassy in London and a lingering scandal over the collapse of an alleged spying case at the heart of Westminster.",
      "Meanwhile, the Dutch government has seized control of the Chinese chipmaker Nexperia, in a saga that has raised fears that car production could come to a halt on the Continent.",
      "Even more so than the United States, European nations have relied on China for critical infrastructure \u2014 only to conclude that it poses a problem if and when relations go south.",
      "A number of European governments have torn out 5G networks made by the Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE \u2014 under pressure from Washington \u2014 because of fears they could be used by Beijing to compromise Western national security.",
      "Today\u2019s hot-button issue is Chinese electric vehicles, which are effectively blocked from sale in the U.S. but whose market share is ballooning in Europe, doubling to 5.1% in the first half of 2025 from last year, according to the auto consultancy JATO Dynamics.",
      "As with other Western concerns, China has roundly rejected that its EVs and other technologies present a security risk.",
      "In January, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned American moves to block Chinese tech from the U.S. auto market, accusing it of \u201coverstretching the concept of national security\u201d and calling for Washington to \u201cstop going after Chinese companies,\u201d spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a daily news briefing.",
      "But plenty of security and intelligence officials are concerned.",
      "Western nations had \u201cthe whole problem with Huawei and 5G, and you\u2019ve now got a similar problem in Chinese electric cars: that they can all be immobilized at a switch from the manufacturer,\u201d the former head of Britain\u2019s MI6 intelligence agency, Richard Dearlove, told NBC News in an interview earlier this year.",
      "\u201cSo if we have a crisis with China, they can bring London to a complete halt by reprogramming\u201d these vehicles.",
      "In reality, this is also true of any electric vehicle \u2014 including those made by Tesla, for example \u2014 and many other items reliant on internet connectivity, said Ken Munro, founder of the British American cybersecurity consultancy Pen Test Partners.",
      "In Norway, Ruter, the electric bus operator, said it had carried out several fixes, including stricter controls on future bus purchases, \u201cfirewalls\u201d to protect against hackers, and \u201ccollaborating with national and local authorities on clear cybersecurity requirements.\u201d",
      "Are experts convinced this will work?",
      "\u201cNot really,\u201d Munro said.",
      "\u201cAny degree of connectivity and the ability to update software, which we all want as consumers,\u201d he said, \u201chas to be enabled.\u201d Munro added: \u201cThe only way to do this, to my mind, would be for the operator to remove all connectivity from that vehicle.\u201d",
      "Munro questioned whether China would actually want to exploit a potential vulnerability like the one identified in the Scandinavian buses.",
      "\u201cDo we believe that China would destroy its entire export industry for vehicles, EVs or not, in order to prove a political and military point? It is within the bounds of plausibility,\u201d but the chances are \u201cincredibly small,\u201d Munro said.",
      "\u201cIt just comes down to trust,\u201d he added."

      "LONDON \u2014 It\u2019s been a strange sort of prison break: no daring escapes, no Hollywood getaways \u2014 just inmates quietly released, by mistake, onto the streets of Britain.",
      "What once might have been an isolated blunder comes at an unwelcome time in a country strained by rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "One man, an Algerian sex offender, was arrested in London on Friday after being freed in error nine days earlier; another, a British national and convicted fraudster, accidentally released from the same prison shortly afterward and turned himself in on Thursday.",
      "Their cases followed the mistaken release of a convicted sex offender from a separate prison in October, which sparked a three-day manhunt before he was rearrested.",
      "At least four prisoners released in error over the past year remain at large, the BBC reports. More than 260 were wrongly released in England and Wales in the year to March, official data shows \u2014 more than double the figure the year before.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy said on X Friday that he was \u201cappalled at the rate of releases in error,\u201d and had ordered \u201ctough new release checks, launched an investigation, and started overhauling archaic prison systems.\u201d",
      "He told Parliament on Wednesday that the opposition Conservative Party, whose 14-year spell in government was ended by Prime Minister Keir Starmer last year, had \u201cleft our prisons on the brink of collapse entirely.\u201d",
      "But the recent litany of errors coincides with the ruling Labour Party battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity.",
      "British prisons have been in a state of crisis for several years, with the prison population more than doubling in size since 1990, while staffing and infrastructure struggle to keep pace.",
      "The Algerian offender, Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, 24, was mistakenly let out on Oct. 29, though police say they weren\u2019t informed until nearly a week later. He was rearrested for being unlawfully at large and on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker in connection with an earlier incident.",
      "As officers bundled him into a van, he offered his own verdict on the system that lost track of him: \u201cLook at the justice of the U.K., they release people by mistake,\u201d he said in a video aired by NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News.",
      "It\u2019s a throwaway line, but it lands with an uncomfortable truth. In a country where little seems to function as it should \u2014 from the courts to the National Health Service to the trains \u2014 even the prisons can\u2019t quite manage to keep the doors locked.",
      "Years of budget cuts are \u201ccatching up\u201d with Britain\u2019s public services, according to Glen O\u2019Hara, a professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University.",
      "\u201cThe whole system of social care, for instance, is completely overwhelmed,\u201d he told NBC News on Saturday, adding that Britain\u2019s prisons had been swamped by a large number of short prison sentences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just overwhelming the system that can\u2019t cope economically with all these numbers,\u201d he said.",
      "Last summer, the men\u2019s prison system was nearly filled to capacity with only a hundred or so empty places, a crisis that triggered the government\u2019s emergency release scheme, allowing some inmates to leave after serving 40% of their sentence instead of the usual 50%. Introduced to ease overcrowding, the policy has since seen nearly 40,000 prisoners released early, Ministry of Justice figures show.",
      "Staffing issues have also plagued the services. In the year to June, nearly 13% of staff left British prisons, according to data from the Prison and Probation Service.",
      "Prison officers said a clerical error meant there was no warrant from the court to hold Kaddour-Cherif, and he was let go. William Smith, the convicted fraudster, was released as a result of a clerical error at the court level, the BBC reports.",
      "Wandsworth prison, where Smith and Kaddour-Cherif were released, was built in 1851 to house fewer than 1,000 prisoners. An August 2024 report by the prison\u2019s independent monitoring board found inmate numbers had grown to 1,513.",
      "\u201cWings were chaotic and staff across most units were unable to confirm where all prisoners were during the working day,\u201d the report said.",
      "The Victorian-era prison, one of many still in use dating back to the 1800s, has previously been the scene of high-profile escapes. Wandsworth made headlines in 2023 when former British soldier Daniel Khalife escaped by clinging to the underside of a lorry while awaiting trial for espionage and terrorism offenses.",
      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that the recent cases \"further expose the scale of the crisis in our prisons we inherited,\" adding: \"This will not be fixed overnight, but we are using every possible lever to bear down on these errors.\"",
      "For all the headlines and investigations, the mistakes continue to pile up in a country struggling to hold itself together, one unlocked gate at a time."

      "Malnourished and dehydrated people are crawling through the desert on their elbows and knees in constant terror of being caught by fighters from Sudan\u2019s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), humanitarian organizations have warned.",
      "The journey from the RSF-controlled city of el-Fasher to the town of Tawila is just 30 miles, but nonetheless perilous as gunmen rove around, robbing people, taking them hostage and in some cases slaughtering them by the dozen, the organizations say.",
      "Under international pressure, the RSF said Thursday that it was willing to engage in a U.S.-brokered humanitarian ceasefire. But the Sudanese military, which it has been fighting since April 2023, has yet to agree to a truce, and the State Department has said it is still working to get both parties to agree to a pause in the fighting amid warnings from the humanitarian organizations that the northeast African nation is returning to its genocidal past.",
      "While talks are ongoing, eyewitness accounts, videos shared to social media and an analysis of satellite imagery that has shown pools of blood visible from space have revealed the scale of the killing in the region and the increasing use of drone strikes by both sides as they seek to gain an advantage on the battlefield.",
      "Hanaa Abdullah Musa said RSF fighters detained her brother at one of several checkpoints she came across as she made her way to Tawila, which is home to hundreds of thousands of displaced people.",
      "\u201cThey drove him to some place,\u201d she told NBC News in a voice note on Thursday. \u201cLater in the evening, they told us they would bring him back, but they never did.\u201d",
      "NBC News has asked the RSF for comment on Musa\u2019s testimony.",
      "Musa, 20, said she had no choice but to keep moving toward Tawila after fighters took her phone and money at a previous checkpoint.",
      "She was one of only about 6,000 people to make it to the town from el-Fasher since the RSF takeover, according to humanitarian organizations working there, all of whom have expressed growing alarm about the paramilitary group\u2019s activity in Sudan\u2019s North Darfur.",
      "\u201cEvery single person who has arrived in Tawila has one or multiple members of their family that they cannot account for,\u201d according to Shashwat Saraf, the country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, a humanitarian organization that provides aid to displaced people."

    "summary": "Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa will meet with President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "The Oval Office is a long way from Abu Ghraib.",
      "When he was greeted by President Donald Trump on Monday, Ahmad al-Sharaa completed his journey from jihadist leader to head of state receiving a warm White House welcome.",
      "Since toppling the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2018s interim leader has spent the past year transforming his global image while tackling deep divisions at home.",
      "Now, al-Sharaa, who has thrown off his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, made history as the first Syrian president to visit the White House.",
      "\"It was an Honor to spend time with Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, the new President of Syria, where we discussed all the intricacies of PEACE in the Middle East, of which he is a major advocate. I look forward to meeting and speaking again,\" Trump posted on Truth Social after his meeting with al-Sharaa, who would not have been able to set foot in the U.S. a year ago thanks to the $10 million bounty on his head. \"Having a stable and successful Syria is very important to all countries in the Region,\" Trump added.",
      "During his Washington visit, Al-Sharaa committed to joining the U.S.-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State militant group, a senior administration official told NBC News, a significant step in Syria's engagement with the West. And diplomats will be allowed to return to the Syrian embassy in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe United States will allow Syria to resume operations at its Embassy in Washington to further counterterrorism, security, and economic coordination,\" the senior administration official said.",
      "The State Department removed al-Sharaa and his interior minister from the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list Friday, while the United Kingdom and Europe removed sanctions on al-Sharaa after the United Nations Security Council voted in favor of a U.S.-drafted resolution to do so.",
      "The Washington trip is \u201ca high-level sign of the trust that the American administration has placed in al-Sharaa \u2014 and the hope that he will succeed in holding Syria together during this incredibly complicated transition period,\u201d said Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "A \u2018turning point\u2019",
      "Al-Sharaa rose to power after leading Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, in toppling Assad\u2019s regime last December.",
      "Since then, he has sought to distance himself from his past as a jihadist who had been jailed by U.S. forces in Iraq, trading military fatigues for smart suits and vowing to rebuild Syria and unify its myriad religious and ethnic groups.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach, a dramatic shift for the U.S., has underscored al-Sharaa\u2019s success in breaking the country\u2019s decadeslong global isolation.",
      "The U.S. removed its terrorist designation for HTS, along with the bounty on al-Sharaa himself, before lifting a string of sanctions following a May meeting between the Syrian leader and Trump in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Sharaa was in New York in September to address the United Nations General Assembly, but Syrian Information Ministry said that being welcomed to the White House marked a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d for the country.",
      "At home, however, al-Sharaa has struggled to unify a deeply divided Syria while grappling with broader threats: a resurgent ISIS, fraught relations with increasingly assertive neighbor Israel, and Russia\u2019s determination to maintain its strategic foothold in Syria while giving safe haven to Assad.",
      "Syria has experienced flashes of violence, including deadly attacks against minority groups allegedly carried out in part by government forces. Growing tensions with Kurdish authorities in northeast Syria have also erupted into violent clashes.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s certainly being (very) smart,\u201d John Jenkins, a former British diplomat who has previously served as head of mission in Syria, said of al-Sharaa in emailed comments.",
      "\u201cA trip to D.C. makes him look respectable,\u201d said Jenkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House and a leader at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Geopolitics. But, he added, \u201dthe key issues are domestic.\u201d",
      "And within Syria, opinions have been deeply divided.",
      "\u201cHe does not represent the Syrian people,\u201d said Sami Zain Al-Din, a 72-year-old political activist from Sweida, a southern city that was rocked by deadly clashes involving the Druze community, which has close ties to Israel.",
      "For Dr. Jalnar Hamad, doubts over al-Sharaa were balanced against hopes that his meeting with Trump could open a \u201cnew chapter\u201d that could see Sweida \u201cbenefit from development or reconstruction programs,\u201d she said.",
      "Ilham Ahmed, co-chair of the Syrian Democratic Council, the political arm of the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, said the Trump meeting was \u201can opportunity to redefine the position of the new Syrian state.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also a chance for Trump to address \u201cthe rights of the Kurdish people and the coalition partners who fought terrorism on behalf of the world,\u201d he said, referring to the SDF\u2019s role against ISIS.",
      "Further sanctions lifted?",
      "Al-Sharaa will be hoping to emerge strengthened domestically, and key to that effort is his bid to remove remaining sanctions imposed on Syria during Assad\u2019s rule.",
      "Already, \u201cthe pace with which sanctions have been eased on Syria since May has been absolutely spectacular,\u201d Karam Shaar, a consultant on Syria and the research director at the Operations and Policy Center think tank in Turkey, said in a voice note.",
      "Shaar said he expected that two \u201cmain pieces of sanctions will have been either lifted or just about to be lifted\u201d by the time al-Sharaa and Trump meet, including the removal of Syria from America\u2019s list of \u201cstate sponsors of terrorism\u201d and the repeal of sanctions under the Caesar Act, a 2019 law targeting the Assad regime.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a statement on Monday that he had given Syria another waiver on the Caesar Act.",
      "But sanctions will not be the only focus, with the effort to quell ISIS\u2019 resurgence and relations with Israel also expected to play a central role.",
      "The U.S. ally has faced growing isolation on the global stage over its deadly assault in Gaza, but Trump has previously expressed hopes Syria would join other Arab nations in normalizing ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, which were expanded again last week.",
      "It remains unclear whether Trump will push the matter during talks with al-Sharaa on Monday.",
      "Syria, historically a staunch ally of Iran, has never recognized Israel and has been locked in a state of conflict with the country since its establishment in 1948. Iranian proxy Hezbollah has also long been deeply embedded in Syria after joining the Assad regime\u2019s military efforts.",
      "When Assad was in power, Israel routinely carried out airstrikes against what it said were Iranian-linked targets inside Syria, and since his ouster, it has deployed troops to a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone and has repeatedly launched airstrikes and incursions into Syria.",
      "Damascus has so far refused to retaliate, while both countries have kept the lines of communication open."

      "Chess\u2019s international governing body said Tuesday that it filed a complaint against former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik after he leveled unproven allegations of cheating against fellow players, including Daniel Naroditsky, who died last month at age 29.",
      "The complaint centers on harassment and \u201cthe insulting of an individual\u2019s dignity,\u201d said the International Chess Federation, known by the acronym FIDE, in a news release.",
      "Naroditsky\u2019s cause of death has not been made public.",
      "Kramnik accused Naroditsky, an American grandmaster of cheating last year and continued to share suspicions on social media.",
      "Naroditsky, a prodigious chess player who helped usher in the game\u2019s online boom with educational YouTube videos and livestreams, denied the allegations.",
      "In his last livestream before his death, Naroditsky said that Kramnik\u2019s allegations had taken a toll on him.",
      "\u201cEver since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions. The issue is just the lingering effect of it,\u201d Naroditsky said.",
      "Other chess grandmasters, including Hikaru Nakamura and Nihal Sarin, have called out Kramnik\u2019s conduct, saying the Russian player had harassed Naroditsky.",

      "The complaint, submitted to the FIDE Ethics & Disciplinary Commission, describes a \u201cpattern of conduct over roughly two years\u201d related to possible harassment, read the federation\u2019s statement. It includes testimony provided by Czech grandmaster David Navara, whom Kramnik also accused of cheating, and \u201cpeople close to Daniel Naroditsky.\u201d",
      "The federation may sanction a player who makes unfounded accusations based on emotion or insufficient data, according to its anti-cheating laws. It also requires substantial evidence to launch a cheating investigation. There were no documented reports of the federation investigating Naroditsky.",
      "The governing body previously said it had referred Kramnik\u2019s statements, before and after Naroditsky\u2019s death, to the ethics commission. Tuesday\u2019s announcement is the formal submission of a complaint."

      "Moreno, who was born in Colombia, has become a key voice on policy involving the Latin American nation \u2014 and one that\u2019s deeply critical of the current left-wing president, Gustavo Petro.",
      "Two days before the lunch, Trump, at odds with Petro for months, posted on social media that Petro was \u201can illegal drug leader strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs\u201d in Colombia. Trump said he was stopping all U.S. aid to the country and told reporters he would soon announce new tariffs on Colombia.",
      "Moreno wanted to encourage Trump to take a more targeted approach \u2014 directly aimed at Petro. To do so, the senator brought along a document titled \u201cThe Trump Doctrine For Colombia and the Western Hemisphere.\u201d In addition to five policy ideas, the one-page outline featured large images of Petro and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the president of Venezuela, in orange prison jumpsuits. The images appear to be generated by artificial intelligence. NBC News obtained the memo from a person familiar with the episode.",
      "Now that document is at the center of an even further strain in diplomatic relationships between Colombia and the U.S.",
      "On Sunday, the publication Cambio Colombia first reported on the existence of the document when it discovered that the White House had posted a photo from the Oct. 21 event showing James Blair, a deputy chief of staff, holding Moreno\u2019s memo.",
      "Petro posted on X that he was recalling the Colombian ambassador to the U.S. for the second time in a month and demanding to know why he is being portrayed \u201cas if I were a prisoner,\u201d calling the print-out \u201ca brutal disrespect\u201d to his supporters and nation.",
      "And on Monday, Colombian Foreign Minister Rosa Villavicencio told journalists in Santa Marta that her government had \"sent verbal notes to the United States through our diplomatic representation\" to \"request clarification regarding\" Moreno's memo.",
      "The episode also marks the latest chapter in the use of fake images in politics. The Trump administration has made extensive use of AI-generated images and videos in online political messaging, with the president himself often sharing them on social media.",
      "The White House directed NBC News to Moreno\u2019s office for comment. Moreno\u2019s office declined to comment.",
      "Moreno, who was born in Bogota and immigrated to the U.S. as a child, is among a few lawmakers advocating on Colombia policy to the president. A Treasury Department official told NBC News that both Moreno and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who endorsed Trump\u2019s call to impose new tariffs on the South American nation, have been backchanneling on Colombia to the White House for a while, with their advocacy culminating at the Rose Garden lunch in October. This person, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been heavily involved as well.",
      "Tensions between the two nations have risen in recent months with the U.S. building up its military deployment in the Caribbean in an effort to target Venezuela. U.S. forces have killed dozens aboard boats officials say are trafficking drugs into the U.S. as lawmakers in both parties have called for the Trump administration to share evidence to support its claims.",
      "Moreno\u2019s memo called for the president to designate more cartels as foreign terrorist organizations; target Petro, his family and associates for further sanctions; and launch an investigation into Petro\u2019s campaign finances, among other measures. The proposal did not include advocacy for new Colombian tariffs or the cutting off of aid to the country. It also did not call for the U.S. to engage in a regime-change effort.",
      "Moreno's document is below. (NBC News added in the watermarks indicating the images are fake.)",
      "Three days after the lunch with senators, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against Petro, his family and a government official over allegations of involvement in the global drug trade, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying in a statement that Petro \u201chas allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\u201d Petro has strongly denied involvement with the drug trade and has said he will fight the sanctions in U.S. courts.",
      "Trump has yet to announce new tariffs on Colombia. And CNN reported last week that there has been no interruption yet to U.S. assistance to the country.",
      "Petro, a socialist, accused the U.S. of killing a fisherman last month in one of its attacks on a boat the U.S. claimed was involved in drug smuggling. The U.S. revoked Petro\u2019s visa during the United Nations General Assembly in September after the Colombian leader spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York and called for U.S. soldiers to resist Trump.",
      "Writing for Time magazine, Petro on Sunday countered Trump\u2019s claims, saying that his government had delivered \u201crecord cocaine seizures\u201d and that the U.S. government\u2019s support \u201cwas crucial in this fight.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever the attitudes of the current administration, I will continue to pursue a counter-narcotics and broader security policy that is in the interests of Colombians and Americans alike,\u201d he wrote.",

      "A cyberattack against British car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, the country\u2019s largest automaker, has been so catastrophic that it put a dent in the U.K.\u2019s gross domestic product, the Bank of England said.",
      "In its quarterly monetary policy report, released Thursday, the Bank of England said headline GDP had grown by 0.2%, less than it had projected. That slowdown was due to reduced exports to the U.S. and \u201cdisruption linked to the Jaguar Land Rover cyberattack,\u201d it said.",
      "The hack against Jaguar Land Rover, which began in August, has proven to be the most economically devastating in British history, said Ciaran Martin, the chair of the technical committee at Cyber Monitoring Centre, a nonprofit that tracks the impacts of cyberattacks on the country.",
      "\u201cWhat makes this incident so bad is the total shutdown of industrial production. That\u2019s much rarer in cyberattacks than is commonly understood,\u201d Martin told NBC News.",
      "Jaguar Land Rover didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The company first publicly acknowledged the attack on Sept. 2, saying that while the hackers didn\u2019t appear to steal customer data, \u201cour retail and production activities have been severely disrupted.\u201d It then took almost four weeks before the company announced it was even close to resuming manufacturing.",
      "In a report on the hack published last month, the Cyber Monitoring Centre found the attack had cost an estimated 1.9 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), surpassing the WannaCry attack of 2017. WannaCry, which the U.S. and U.K. accused North Korea of creating, spread across computers around the world, with the British National Health Service among the biggest victims. Roughly 1 in 5 of the trusts that administer NHS hospitals were locked down through that attack.",
      "Though the Cyber Monitoring Centre said that the specifics of what happened at Jaguar Land Rover are still unclear, the attack\u2019s fallout has been extremely far-reaching, affecting the company\u2019s global manufacturing operations at at least three U.K. plants, as well as car dealerships and a host of smaller companies that supply automotive parts.",
      "\u201cProduction lines were halted for several weeks, dealer systems were intermittently unavailable, and suppliers faced cancelled or delayed orders, with uncertainty about future order volumes,\u201d the report found.",
      "The known details of the event are consistent with ransomware, where cybercriminals gain access to a company\u2019s or government\u2019s computer systems and encrypt or threaten to delete them, demanding an extortion payment to make them usable again. Even when victims choose to pay their attackers, it can take weeks or months to restore operations.",
      "Ransomware is one of the most destructive and profitable forms of cybercrime. An analysis published in February by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence found there had been at least 5,289 attacks in 2024, with some netting tens of millions of dollars in ransom payments.",
      "The British government has not publicly accused anyone of masterminding the hack. A group of hackers who had claimed to be behind a string of other hacks against large British and American companies earlier this year told the BBC in September that they were responsible for hacking Jaguar Land Rover. NBC News was unable to confirm with the group, as their channel on Telegram, the app where they had previously made such claims, has been deleted."

      "Despite \u201cgreat efforts\u201d made by Canadian health officials, \u201cthe country has lost its measles elimination status and is now considered endemic for the disease,\u201d Jarbas Barbosa, the head of the Pan American Health Organization, said during a media briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cThis loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible,\u201d Barbosa said.",
      "Canadian health officials will now have to come up with a plan to get back on track, including improving vaccination rates and \u201cenabling better overall surveillance efforts,\u201d the country's public health agency said in a statement.",
      "The country eliminated measles in 1998, two years before the U.S.",
      "The spread of measles in the Americas is not limited to Canada. As of last week, PAHO officials reported that there\u2019ve been 12,593 confirmed measles cases across the entire region, which encompasses North, Central and South America \u2014 30 times the number reported last year.",
      "The vast majority of 2025 cases \u2014 95% \u2014 have been in Canada, Mexico and the U.S., and the latter two countries could soon also lose their measles elimination status.",
      "In Mexico, nearly 4,000 cases have been reported since February. Ongoing spread in the state of Chihuahua, in the northwestern part of the country, accounts for 93% of the country\u2019s outbreak. Twenty-three people have died.",
      "In the U.S., an outbreak that began in January continues to spread across the country.",
      "The outbreak started in West Texas and stretched into New Mexico. At least 862 people \u2014 mostly in Texas \u2014 were infected. Three people died, including two little girls who lived in the epicenter of the outbreak, Gaines County, Texas.",
      "Though cases have subsided in West Texas, the virus has continued to spread. Forty-one states have reported cases. As of last week, 1,681 measles cases had been confirmed in the U.S. in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most in more than 30 years.",
      "In Utah and Arizona, an outbreak concentrated in a close-knit community that straddles the border between the states is nearing 200 cases.",
      "In South Carolina, 38 cases have been reported in the northwestern part of the state since July.",
      "The outbreaks have occurred as vaccination rates have declined steadily in the U.S.",
      "A monthslong NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots. Two are recommended.",
      "Vaccination coverage for both MMR doses across countries in the PAHO region averaged 79% last year, according to the group.",
      "Measles is the most contagious virus known on the planet. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the room. Anyone in that room who hasn\u2019t been vaccinated against measles will likely get sick.",
      "Who determines a nation\u2019s measles elimination status?",
      "The PAHO, part of the World Health Organization, determines whether a country in North, South or Central America has maintained or lost its elimination status.",
      "Elimination means that a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, meaning that it\u2019s been wiped out worldwide.",
      "On a technical level, when one country in the Americas loses its status, the region as a whole is deemed to have lost its elimination status. Canada is the only country in the region, however, that\u2019s been specifically called out for its year-plus measles spread.",
      "Measles is nowhere near being eradicated. Even with Canada losing its measles elimination status, the region of the Americas accounts for just 7.5% of cases globally, Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with PAHO, said during a media briefing Monday. Most are in the Middle East and South Asia.",
      "In 2019, PAHO established a panel of independent experts, called the Regional Verification Commission, to do an annual review of how countries are able to control measles spread.",
      "The panel met last week in Mexico City to analyze the latest measles data submitted from countries with active outbreaks through October.",
      "A PAHO spokesman said the group could not confirm whether its independent committee will meet again in January to discuss measles spread in the U.S."

      "Indonesia has a new national hero: its former dictator, the late President Suharto.",
      "The official award Monday drew outrage from rights activists who accuse the country\u2019s current leader, President Prabowo Subianto, of whitewashing his former father-in-law\u2019s legacy.",
      "Suharto, a staunch anti-communist who was a close U.S. ally during the Cold War, ruled for 32 years before he was ousted by deadly mass protests in 1998 amid the Asian financial crisis. His rule was marked by rapid economic growth and political stability as well as accusations of human rights violations, corruption and nepotism.",
      "Suharto was among 10 people who received the national hero title at the presidential palace in Jakarta. The annual award is given to those who have contributed significantly to the development of Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago and former Dutch colony that declared independence in 1945.",
      "\u201cA prominent figure from Central Java province, a hero of the struggle for independence, General Suharto stood out since the independence era,\u201d an announcer said as Prabowo gave the award to Suharto\u2019s daughter and son.",
      "Suharto, a military officer, became president in 1967 after seizing power from Indonesia\u2019s first president and independence leader, Sukarno, who was viewed as pro-communist by Western governments.",
      "Minister of Culture Fadli Zon said Suharto had played a key role in Indonesian independence and also led the military operation that helped regain what is now West Papua from the Dutch in the 1960s.",
      "Suharto was a key military officer during a 1965 military-led purge of communists said to be planning a coup. Indonesia has never investigated the purge, during which historians say about 500,000 people were killed in one of the 20th century\u2019s worst massacres, and Suharto was never proved to be involved.",
      "He also oversaw Indonesia\u2019s 1975 invasion of East Timor and the 24-year occupation that followed, which is estimated to have killed 100,000 people or more. East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, gained independence from Indonesia in 2002.",
      "Suharto and his family were also accused of stealing as much as $45 billion in state funds, though it was never proven. Though authorities tried to bring corruption charges starting in 2000, Suharto did not appear in court and the charges were later dropped because of his poor health. He died in 2008 in his late 80s.",
      "He is also credited with driving the rapid economic development of Indonesia, a country of 280 million people that is the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation.",
      "\u201cIn the \u201970s and \u201980s, 50 million people were lifted out of the most severe poverty,\u201d David Henley, a professor of contemporary Indonesian studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThat is Suharto\u2019s greatest claim to hero status.\u201d",
      "Despite the atrocities that marked Suharto\u2019s regime, he was \u201cnever completely disgraced,\u201d Henley said.",
      "\u201cThere has for some time been a tendency in official circles to rehabilitate Suharto\u201d and to see his regime \u201cin a progressively more positive light,\u201d he said.",
      "Others have resisted that trend.",
      "Every Thursday there is a silent protest outside the presidential palace in Jakarta over Suharto's alleged abuses, including by people still searching for loved ones.",
      "Protesters also gathered in Jakarta last week to oppose giving Suharto the national hero title.",
      "Prabowo, who was formerly married to Suharto\u2019s daughter Siti Hediati Hariyadi, also has a military background. He has denied accusations of human rights violations in East Timor, where he led a special forces unit in the 1980s, and in Papua.",
      "He was also commander of a special forces unit that was accused of abducting and torturing democracy activists in the 1990s, though Prabowo was never charged.",
      "He was later banned from traveling to the U.S. until 2020, when he became defense minister. He became president last year.",
      "Even after Suharto\u2019s death, his family\u2019s legacy remains deeply entrenched in Indonesian politics. His political party, Golkar, is still a formidable force and backed Prabowo\u2019s presidential bid last year."

      "There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, or any reports of abnormalities at the two nuclear power plants in the area.",
      "The agency issued an advisory for a tsunami of up to 1 meter (3 feet) along the northern coastal region, and subsequently said the water could reach as high as 3 meters in some spots.",
      "A tsunami of about 10 centimeters (4 inches) was detected at Ofunato city in Iwate Prefecture, Ominato port, Miyako and Kamaishi, and subsequently as high as 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the coastal area of Kuji.

      "Kiran, a 27-year-old financial trader who has struggled with hypothyroidism, said he \u201cdid not have a lot of expectations\u201d when it came to losing weight. But \u201cluck turned out in my favor,\u201d he said, and in six months he lost all of the 60-plus pounds he had gained a few years earlier.",
      "\u201cIt was a two-year struggle that came to an end, and I couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Indians trying to lose weight are embracing drugs such as Mounjaro, which is also used to treat diabetes in a country that has been called the world\u2019s diabetes capital.",
      "The injectable medication from American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has become India\u2019s most popular drug by value since being approved in March, with over $11 million in sales in October, pharmaceutical market research firm Pharmarack said Friday.",
      "Even before India\u2019s more recent approval of Ozempic, another drug that is widely used for weight loss in the United States and other countries, there was already surging demand in the country for semaglutide, its active ingredient.",
      "Ozempic\u2019s Danish drugmaker, Novo Nordisk, says it is \u201cactively working\u201d to widen the availability of the drug, which Indian regulators have approved for diabetes but not obesity. The company also makes other semaglutide drugs that are already used for weight loss in India, including Wegovy, an injectable, and Rybelsus, which is taken orally.",
      "Demand could grow even further when the patent for Ozempic\u2019s active ingredient, semaglutide, expires next March in India, a pharmaceutical manufacturing giant where companies are eager to produce cheaper generic versions of the lucrative weight-loss drugs.",
      "The exploding popularity of the drugs has taken aback some doctors and officials, with Jitendra Singh, a government minister and physician, warning in August against the \u201cunchecked spread of disinformation\u201d through \u201cfad regimens\u201d and emphasizing the importance of lifestyle interventions such as regular yoga practice.",
      "Semaglutide and tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro, are GLP-1 agonists that were first developed to treat diabetes and have also been approved in many countries for the treatment of obesity. They regulate blood sugar and help slow how quickly food passes through the stomach, curbing hunger as a result.",
      "India, the world\u2019s most populous country, has over 100 million people with diabetes, or nearly 10% of its adult population, according to a 2023 study by the Indian Council of Medical Research. An additional 135 million people are prediabetic, the study found.",
      "Doctors say the situation is worsening as India\u2019s burgeoning middle class adopts a more Western lifestyle, eating more high-fat, high-sugar foods and exercising less.",
      "\u201cCompared to, say, a decade ago, there are more people now in their late 20s and early 30s who are being diagnosed with diabetes, as compared to the elderly population,\u201d said Dr. Saurav Shishir Agrawal, an endocrinologist in Noida, which is part of Delhi\u2019s capital region.",
      "\u201cThey ask us to just give them pills,\u201d Agrawal said, \u201cbut these medicines work better only when you are clubbing them with lifestyle changes.\u201d",
      "Agrawal practices at the newly built Medanta Hospital, where staff greet patients with a gentle \u201cNamaste.\u201d It is an example of the growing number of modern and high-end hospitals popping up around increasingly dense megacities such as Delhi, home to 33 million people, where diabetes has a greater hold.",
      "A monthly course of Mounjaro can cost as much as $250, the average monthly salary in many parts of India. But for more affluent Indians, a bigger deterrent is the idea of injecting themselves, said Dr. Tribhuvan Gulati, an endocrinologist.",
      "\u201cPeople get scared whenever you tell them that they\u2019re going to be on an injectable,\u201d said Gulati, who has a clinic in central Delhi.",
      "Gulati keeps a demo pen of Mounjaro in a drawer to show how easy it is to use the medicine, which just needs to be refrigerated before use.",
      "But the ease of use is also what worries Gulati and other doctors, who say many patients fail to overhaul the lifestyle and dietary habits causing or contributing to their health issues in the first place.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the causes of obesity in India, it is 90% lifestyle and 10% anything else,\u201d said Dr. Anoop Misra, chairman of the Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol and head of India\u2019s National Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation.",
      "\u201cThe diet now is totally imbalanced because of free availability of food everywhere,\u201d he said.",
      "The potential gastrointestinal and other side effects from the weight-loss drugs, which in the U.S. have prompted multiple lawsuits against GLP-1 makers, give some patients pause, Gulati said. But others \u201care OK with continuing it throughout their life because they know that they won\u2019t be able to control themselves.\u201d",
      "Diabetic patients such as Moinak Pal, who has high insulin resistance, say that GLP-1 drugs have been the easiest way to lose weight.",
      "\u201cI have been fat-shamed since I was a child,\u201d said Pal, 34, a Noida-based journalist. He said he has been losing about 3 pounds a week since he started taking Mounjaro.",
      "It was \u201cextremely difficult for me to lose weight by conventional means,\u201d he said.",
      "Part of the problem, Misra said, is the lifestyle in India\u2019s sprawling and congested urban areas, where commutes can last as long as four hours round-trip. When workers get home, apps can deliver everything from food to clothes to their doorsteps in minutes.",
      "\u201cThey want quick fixes that don\u2019t involve going on a restrictive diet or daily exercise of an hour and so on,\u201d he said of some of his patients. \u201cAs a result, diabetes is everywhere. Every day I see patients who are young, who have uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes.\u201d",
      "Rajendra Nath Dixit blames nobody but himself for his health problems. The retired banker had heart bypass surgery earlier this year, and before that had been spending almost 8,000 rupees ($90) a month just on his insulin.",
      "\u201cI was fond of taking the typical Indian oily foods, samosas, chole bhature, and in the evening I would take five or six rotis,\u201d said Dixit, 66. \u201cEvery bad habit was there.\u201d",
      "In the five months since his surgery, Dixit has switched over completely to the oral semaglutide Rybelsus, is exercising more and is consuming less fat and sugar. He is spending 11,000 rupees ($125) a month on Rybelsus, but has been able to stop using insulin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m feeling very good, very light,\u201d he said. \u201cMy confidence has gone up, and my life has totally changed.\u201d"

      "An elderly Iranian American man, who is Jewish, is being held in Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison on charges related to his trip to Israel 13 years ago to celebrate his son\u2019s bar mitzvah, a family member told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Kamran Hekmati, 70, was sentenced because Iranians are not permitted to visit Israel under Iranian law. Hekmati is one of at least four Americans who is currently detained in Iran, according to a source familiar with their arrests who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. Hekmati\u2019s detention was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Iranian American Reza Valizadeh, a journalist, has been held in Iran since 2024.",
      "The State Department would not directly address Hekmati\u2019s case, citing privacy considerations, and a spokesperson for the department said they are unable to provide the number of U.S. citizens who are detained in Iran.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian regime has a long history of unjustly and wrongfully detaining other countries\u2019 citizens,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cIran should release these individuals immediately.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations declined to comment on his detention.",
      "The family member, who spoke to NBC News anonymously out of concern for repercussions against Hekmati, confirmed that he had traveled from his home in New York to Iran for a personal visit in May and was arrested in July after several interrogations at a relative\u2019s home. Hekmati has bladder cancer and is in poor health, according to the family member. His family hopes he will be released on humanitarian grounds.",
      "The State Department has long warned Americans against traveling to Iran, citing the heightened risks of detention.",
      "\u201cAnyone with a U.S. connection, including dual U.S.-Iranian nationals, is at significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in\u202fIran,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said. \u201cWe\u202fcontinue to engage with allies and partners on this issue and on cases of unjust detention in Iran in general.\u201d"

      "HONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s largest and most advanced aircraft carrier has entered service, Chinese state media said Friday, in a major step for the world\u2019s largest navy as it seeks to challenge U.S. dominance in the Pacific.",
      "The Fujian is China\u2019s third aircraft carrier but the first to be both designed and built domestically. It features an electromagnetic catapult system that allows for aircraft launches with heavier payloads compared with existing launch systems, according to CCTV, China\u2019s state-run broadcaster.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping presided over the carrier\u2019s commissioning on Wednesday at a military port on the island of Hainan in a ceremony attended by over 2,000 naval officers and construction personnel, CCTV said.",
      "Both of China\u2019s previous aircraft carriers used a ski-jump type system, which is unable to handle fighter jets carrying heavier loads or large support aircraft. Its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, was made by the Soviet Union while its second, the Shandong, was built in China based on the Soviet model.",
      "The Fujian\u2019s three electromagnetic catapult positions \u201cwere particularly noticeable\u201d along the flight deck, the CCTV report said, which also featured China\u2019s new carrier-based jets: the stealth-fighter J-35, the heavy-fighter J-15T, and the early-warning aircraft KJ-600.",
      "Though the Chinese navy is the world\u2019s largest, the U.S. navy, with its 11 aircraft carriers, is still considered the most advanced.",
      "Under Xi, China\u2019s navy has undergone rapid modernization with the goal of being able to go head-to-head against America\u2019s. China has said its goal is for military modernization to be \u201cbasically complete\u201d by 2035, and for the Chinese military to be \u201cworld class\u201d by 2049, the 100th anniversary of communist rule.",
      "Experts say the Fujian and the other two carriers could be crucial assets in the event of conflict over Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "China\u2019s neighbors are closely watching its military developments.",
      "\u201cIt appears that the aim of the Chinese military is to enhance its operational capabilities in distant waters and airspace through the strengthening of their naval forces,\u201d Minoru Kihara, Japan\u2019s top government spokesperson, told reporters in Tokyo on Friday.",
      "He said China was \u201cexpanding its military capabilities extensively and rapidly, without sufficient transparency,\u201d adding that Japan was monitoring Chinese military activity in the area and would \u201crespond calmly but also resolutely\u201d if necessary.",
      "The commissioning of the Fujian comes two months after China held a massive military parade in Beijing that showcased its most advanced weapons.",
      "The Fujian, which was launched in 2022 and began sea trials in May 2024, is only the second aircraft carrier in the world to use an electromagnetic catapult system after the latest American carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford. Most American carriers use older steam catapult technology that China has bypassed.",
      "But the Fujian lags behind in one key area: nuclear power.",
      "All American carriers are nuclear-powered, meaning they have virtually unlimited range, while the Fujian, which is the world\u2019s largest conventionally powered warship, is estimated to have a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles.",
      "That could change, however, as China may be developing a nuclear-powered supercarrier, NBC News reported in March.",
      "All three Chinese aircraft carriers \u2014 the Liaoning, the Shandong and the Fujian \u2014 are named after coastal provinces."
