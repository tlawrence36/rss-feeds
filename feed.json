      "Joachim Trier's \u201cSentimental Value\" builds its emotional power subtly through scenes that, like much of the acclaimed Danish-Norwegian filmmaker\u2019s filmography, pulse with the rhythm of life",
      "NEW YORK -- Joachim Trier, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Renate Reinsve have gathered in a backstage room at Lincoln Center\u2019s Alice Tully Hall. A screen on the wall shows the crowd inside, raptly watching their film, \u201cSentimental Value.\u201d They have all consciously sat facing away from the movie.",
      "But if there\u2019s one moment from the film they sometimes sneak in for, it\u2019s the final scene. At festivals, they\u2019ve sometimes taken the stage for a Q&A with tears still in their eyes.",
      "\u201cThe ending always moves me,\u201d Skarsg\u00e5rd says. \u201cOn the paper, it really scared me. It could have been sentimental hell, not \u2018Sentimental Value.\u2019 What was important to me was that nothing was resolved. I hate the word closure. There\u2019s no closure in life. But there\u2019s something more beautiful.\u201d",
      "\u201cSentimental Value,\u201d written and directed by Trier, builds its emotional power subtly through scenes that, like much of the acclaimed Danish-Norwegian filmmaker\u2019s filmography, pulse with the rhythm of life. By the time the film reaches its crescendo, a simple exchange of looks is enough to leave you stirred to your core.",
      "That effect isn\u2019t new to fans of Trier\u2019s previous films, like \u201cOslo, August 31st\u201d or his previous one, \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d which starred Reinsve. But \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d which Neon opens in theaters Friday, is uniquely personal statement for Trier that also happens \u2014 because it\u2019s so much about the intermingling of life and art, and how one enriches the other \u2014 to resonate deeply with his two stars.",
      "Skarsg\u00e5rd plays the venerated filmmaker Gustav Borg, who has long been estranged from his family. But after the death of his ex-wife, Borg comes back into the lives of his daughters Nora (Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas). Like her father, Nora is tough and stubborn, and her outlet is in performance. Gustav wants her to star in his new and highly autobiographical film, a project that also draws the interest of an American starlet (Elle Fanning).",
      "Both Reinsve and Skarsg\u00e5rd have direct similarities to their character. Reinsve, 37, experienced a breakthrough in \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Skarsg\u00e5rd, 74, is the father of eight, many of them actors. But \u201cSentimental Value,\" the Grand Prix winner at the Cannes Film Festival, has deeper reverberations for them, and for Trier. In a conversation that, like one of Trier's films, featured embraces and tears and the gratification of feeling seen, the three reflected on making a film poised between life and fiction.",
      "REINSVE: For me it was nerve-racking because he knows me so well. I didn\u2019t know what he was going to find. He\u2019s very smart and very wise, so what he finds is probably the truth.",
      "TRIER: The revealing of something in art is what interests us. So one might think I know too well what to do, but it\u2019s a compliment to these actors that they\u2019re able to come into a position of control and craft and yet (laughs) unhinge themselves in unusual ways in front of the camera. You want that. You yearn for it. What, you were worried I\u2019ll reveal something you don\u2019t want to show?",
      "REINSVE: Yeah.",
      "TRIER: But you are so brave.",
      "REINSVE: But I became brave with you. In the theater, I worked on a lot of characters that you build and construct. You\u2019re making it big for the audience. Playing Julie in \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d you encouraged me to let go of that. I remember one of our first conversations, I was worried because I didn\u2019t know how to build her. And you said, \u201cBut do you have to? Can\u2019t you just find it in you?\u201d For me that was so scary.",
      "SKARSGARD: It\u2019s flattering in a way, but you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s flattering. The character on the paper wasn\u2019t really what he is in the film. I remember I said to you, \u201cCan\u2019t you get over your problems with your father?\u201d",
      "TRIER: And I said, (voice intentionally squeaking) \u201cI\u2019m over them!\u201d",
      "SKARSGARD: The hard edges of the character were very obvious in the script, but the compassion wasn\u2019t.",
      "TRIER: When you came into it, that solved it. I mean, character is something that happens with actors.",

      "TRIER: We love that scene.",
      "REINSVE: Before I worked with Joachim, I played a lot of characters that keep their emotions really inside and aren\u2019t able to let them out. Joachim built that trust because of how he worked and how he sees people. It was safe to let go of something in there. He sits beside the camera and whispers. He can tap into the actor\u2019s instinct. I\u2019m a person or an actor who has a lot of resistance, which is good for the dynamic in a character. But it can also hinder you from letting go of something you need to. Joachim sits there and knows what the actor wants to do and he says, \u201cLet yourself do it.\u201d It feels like we\u2019re doing it together.",
      "SKARSGARD: I\u2019ve always seen acting as a way of being able to do what you can\u2019t do in your private life. I\u2019m pretty reserved, in a way. I am!",
      "REINSVE: Not with us.",
      "TRIER: I hear you say that!",
      "SKARSGARD: But it\u2019s fantastic to have this art where you can also test everything. Can I feel that? Wow! Yeah! It\u2019s like a child playing in a sandbox. It\u2019s the same mechanism. They play other people from day one. Maybe it\u2019s evolutionary: mimicking the adults to survive.",
      "REINSVE: We\u2019re still children mimicking the adults.",
      "TRIER: It\u2019s funny because a lot of people have trouble making art of a personal sort.

Art creates life, imitates\u2026",

      "NEW YORK -- A once-overlooked army psychiatrist tasked with analyzing Hermann G\u00f6ring and other Nazis accused of war crimes is getting the kind of attention that he had sought in his lifetime.",
      "\u201cNuremberg,\u201d starring Russell Crowe as G\u00f6ring, centers on the Nazi military commander's conversations with Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, played by Rami Malek. Kelley's mission was to determine whether G\u00f6ring and more than 20 other Nazi officials captured at the end of World War II were fit to stand trial in Nuremberg. The movie is directed by James Vanderbilt and based on a 2013 book, \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d by Jack El-Hai, who helped Vanderbilt write the screenplay.",
      "Through many hours at facilities in Luxembourg and Nuremberg, Kelley will find himself alternately taken and frightened by a man notorious for his role in the Nazis' attempted conquest of Europe and beyond. G\u00f6ring turns out to be unexpectedly good and clever company, if not convincing in his assertion that he knew nothing of Hitler\u2019s worst atrocities and cared only to restore Germany to greatness after its humiliating defeat in World War I.",

      "___",
      "Kelley, an ambitious and demonstrative man who took his own life in 1958, might never have inspired a major Hollywood production had his name not turned up while El-Hai was working on a previous book. While writing about Dr. Walter Freeman, who helped make lobotomy a common treatment, El-Hai came upon an encounter between Freeman and Kelley at an American Psychiatric Association gathering in the late 1930s.",
      "\u201cWhat struck Freeman about Kelley was that Kelley was not there to present a paper or do anything like that. He was there to give a magic show on the stage to entertain all his fellow psychiatrists,\u201d El-Hai told The Associated Press. \u201cSo a few years after I finished \u2018The Lobotomy,\u2019 I decided to find out what I could about Dr. Kelley\u2019s story.\u201d",
      "El-Hai got in touch with Kelley's eldest child, Doug, who gave him access to a trove of his father's archives, some 15 boxes containing everything from medical records to a package of cookies Nazi leader Rudolf Hess refused to eat out of fear they had been poisoned. In \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d El-Hai follows Kelley's life from his rise in the psychiatric profession through the controversies of his years after returning home from Europe, starting with his contention that in the U.S. there are people who, to gain power, \u201cwould willingly climb over the corpses of half of the American public.\u201d",
      "As a professor of criminology at the University of California, Berkeley, Kelley was a showman in the classroom who cracked jokes, drew elaborate designs and performed magic tricks. As a consultant to the Berkeley Police Department, he openly challenged the competence of law enforcement officials and was eventually monitored by the FBI, which suspected him of political subversion. He also gave lectures around the country and published a book about his wartime findings, \u201c22 Cells in Nuremberg,\u201d which sold few copies and is long out of print.",
      "His death echoed the suicide of G\u00f6ring, who 12 years earlier had taken a cyanide pill he\u2019d hidden in his cell. G\u00f6ring\u2019s life ended in secret, Kelley\u2019s in front of his family. After a loud argument with his wife, he rushed upstairs to his study, reemerged with a cyanide capsule in his hand and shouted \u201cI don\u2019t have to take this anymore!\u201d Kelley left no explanation. His son, according to El-Hai, believed he had been overcome by his \u201cemotions and inner pain.\u201d",

      "During a recent interview with The Associated Press, El-Hai spoke of Kelley's findings, the parallels between Kelley and G\u00f6ring and why he believes the story resonates now. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "EL-HAI: One of Kelley\u2019s central questions that he had going into this work was the question that was strongly of interest to me: Did these men who were all defendants in this first Nuremberg trial share any psychiatric disorders, illness, his personality traits, any of that? And Kelley found to his disappointment that they did not \u2014 none of them, with the possible exception of (German Labor Front leader) Robert Ley, who killed himself before the trial. They certainly had neuroses, but many people who function normally have neuroses. That made him afraid and made him believe that people like that are in our population in far greater numbers than any of us.",
      "They were all people who believed that the ends justify the means and that most of them were, on a personal level, on a quest for power. And that was more important than ideology. So they would attach themselves to an ideology that allowed them to rise and to crush anybody else who got in their way.",
      "El-HAI: There was very little remorse.",
      "El-HAI: He wanted to be treated as a head of state, which he considered himself to be. He said to some of his fellow defendants, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, before much time goes by, there will be statues of us all over Germany.\u201d",
      "El-HAI: Especially if the alternative was to be hanged, which they all considered to be an execution method for a common criminal. Kelley observed that by poisoning himself right before the execution, G\u00f6ring was putting a thumb in the eye of the American authorities. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do with what you want to do with me.\u201d And that really resonated with Kelley.",
      "EL-HAI: It was not a concern of mine. As a result of the courtroom scenes that are in the second half of the film, G\u00f6ring loses a lot of his luster, as happened in the real courtroom. Rami, in playing the counterpoint to the villainous G\u00f6ring, maybe had to think about it more, because I have always seen those two characters as being more similar than not similar.",
      "When I was writing the book, I often discussed with Dr. Kelley\u2019s son, Doug, what it must have been like for them to be in this jail cell together, and we always jokingly characterized them as King Kong versus Godzilla. They were both egomaniacs. They were both absolutely certain of their rightness. And they were both socially charming and highly intelligent.",
      "EL-HAI: I was OK with James Vanderbilt\u2019s approach from the start. Whenever he would send me a draft of the screenplay, I didn\u2019t see it as my job to find inaccuracies and things that weren\u2019t factual. I know movies are a different medium from books and that what makes a book good is not the same as what makes a movie good. And so what we\u2019ve ended up with in \u201cNuremberg,\u201d I think, is a movie that is mostly factual, and more important, delivers the messages that are very close to the messages in my book.",
      "Douglas Kelley\u2019s message was that Nazism, fascism, or whatever you want to call it, has always had the potential for coming alive in our country. He saw it immediately when he came back from Europe, and it\u2019s certainly easier to find now.",

      "The seventh \u201cPredator\u201d film takes the franchise to new places by sticking its two stars together",
      "SAN DIEGO -- SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d belongs to a long-established cinema subgenre: two opposed people reluctantly stuck together with a common purpose.",
      "The film, the seventh in the franchise (not counting the \u201cAlien vs. Predator\u201d offshoots), has the buddy comedy energy that comes with that dynamic. It also belongs to the narrower subgenre of people quite literally stuck together, like 1958's \u201cThe Defiant Ones,\u201d in which Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis were fugitives united by chains.",
      "And, in a scenario that provided special challenges for stars Elle Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d belongs to a still narrower subset it may share only with \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d: movies with a broken android worn like a backpack by a tall and powerful creature as they face peril in a strange corner of space.",
      "\u201cThe real physical inspiration for it was C-3PO strapped to Chewbacca\u2019s back,\u201d director Dan Trachtenberg told The Associated Press in an interview where he was joined by the film's two stars. \u201cBut I think the fun of this is that it\u2019s not Chewbacca.

      "For much of the New Zealand shoot, Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi were every bit as close as they appear to be in the film, where the top half of her artificially intelligent character, Thia, was back-to-back with Schuster-Koloamatangi's young Predator, Dek, who is out to prove himself on a hunt against a seemingly unkillable megamonster.",

      "In the scenes when they weren't back-to-back, Trachtenberg wanted them to be genuinely face-to-face.",
      "\u201cWe developed this system where he wore a suit, but his face was open,\u201d the director said. \u201cAnd that way Dimitrius could really be driving the performance, and he and Elle could work off each other in moments, though fleeting, when they were actually facing each other.\u201d",

      "The Recording Academy will announce the 2026 Grammy Award nominees on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- The Recording Academy will announce the 2026 Grammy Award nominees on Friday. It\u2019s as good a reason as any to take a beat and examine how the institution makes it decisions. Who selects the nominees? Who votes? Can anyone nominate any recorded release for a Grammy?",
      "We\u2019ve got you covered. Read on to get a crash course on how Grammy voting works.",
      "Members of the Recording Academy and record labels submit artists in certain categories, which are then vetted for eligibility. Currently, there are 95 Grammy Award categories.",
      "After submissions have been screened, voting members help determine who the final nominations will be \u2014 typically in the fall \u2014 using a membership dashboard. They can only vote for music that has been submitted and vetted.",
      "Once the nominees are determined and announced in November, a period of final round voting takes place. This cycle, that runs from Dec. 12 through Jan. 5.",
      "Winners are announced live at the award show in February.",
      "And don\u2019t get it twisted \u2014 voting members do not vote in all 95 categories. They\u2019re permitted to vote in up to 10 categories across three genre fields, as well as the six general field categories, which include record, album, song, producer, non-classical and songwriter, non-classical of the year, and best new artist. That allows experts to focus on their expertise.",
      "There are three types of Recording Academy memberships: Grammy U, professional and voting memberships. The latter includes performers, songwriters, producers, engineers, instrumentalists and beyond. Those are the members who determine Grammy winners each year.",
      "Voting members have to provide a proof of a primary career in music, two recommendations and certain verifiable credits.",

      "Oct 30, 10:54 PM",
      "But there are a few ways around some of those requirements: If you are a current year\u2019s Grammy winner or nominee, you do not need to provide a recommendation from someone in the industry. If you\u2019ve been nominated for a Grammy in the last five years, you do not need to provide proof of your credits.",
      "Entries must adhere to the specific qualifications of the categories they are submitted into. Rules and guidelines can be found at Grammy.com.",
      "There are also frequent changes made to categories and fields. In 2026, there have been a few: best country album has been divided into best contemporary country album and best traditional country album. The best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories have also been combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own.",
      "Most importantly: Recordings and music videos must also be submitted within the Grammy eligibility window, which for the 2026 award show means work released between Aug. 31, 2024 \u2013 Aug. 30, 2025.",
      "The category of new artist is constantly evolving, trying to capture the zeitgeist each year as the process of categorizing fame gets more complicated. The Grammy rules currently say nominations hinge on whether \u201cthe artist had attained a breakthrough or prominence\u201d \u2014 and it delegates that determination to a screening committee. Eligible artists must have released at least five singles or one album, but there is no longer a maximum. That\u2019s why someone like, say, Sabrina Carpenter \u2014 who broke out in the summer of \u201cEspresso\u201d \u2014 found herself up for the best new artist trophy in 2025 despite being on her sixth full-length release.",
      "And this year, the category has also been expanded to include acts who were featured on previous album of the year nominees, so long as they fall below 20% of the album\u2019s music.",
      "The Grammys will be held Feb. 1 at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, with nominations announced on Friday. It will be broadcast live on CBS and can be streamed on demand via Paramount+.",

      "He said it is \u201ca remarkable, addictive book. Garner takes the diary form, mixing the intimate, the intellectual, and the everyday, to new heights.",
      "\u201cThere are places it\u2019s toe-curlingly embarrassing. She puts it all out there,\u201d Millen said, adding that Garner ranks alongside those of Virginia Woolf in the canon of great literary diarists.",

I burnt it up until about the late 1970s. But it\u2019s my 10,000 hours and it\u2019s my enormous daily practice. So you never expect that to be out in the public eye. But it is.\u201d",

      "The recognition arrives as Lee reemerges into the spotlight after a contentious, high-profile departure from the agency he founded in 1995 \u2014 a management battle that included a public feud with his nephew-in-law and a bidding war over his shares. He\u2019s been keeping busy since, debuting a new band, A2O MAY, in both China and the U.S. He's also investing in a boutique Chinese firm\u2019s high-tech production technologies.",
      "Born in South Korea, Lee studied computer engineering in the U.S. for his master's degree. That technical background would later inform his approach to everything from visualization and cutting-edge production technologies \u2014 he said he\u2019s been rewatching \"The Matrix\u201d to revisit filming techniques \u2014 to pioneering elaborate \u201cworldviews\u201d and virtual avatars for his K-pop bands.",
      "For Lee, the Hall of Fame honor \u201cconfirms that K-pop has become a genre that the mainstream is now paying attention to\u201d \u2014 an acceptance that came after costly lessons and years of trial and error.",
      "Lee invested about $5 million in BoA\u2019s 2009 American debut with \u201cEat You Up,\u201d one of the first songs by a South Korean artist to be primarily written and produced by Western producers \u2014 a bold early attempt to bring K-pop into the U.S. mainstream. But with few widely recognized Asian artists in American pop culture at the time, the market wasn\u2019t ready. After nearly two years, BoA \u2014 already a megastar in Korea and Japan \u2014 decided to return home. The experience, Lee has said, left him with lasting regrets.",
      "\u201cWhen I asked the songwriter(s) to revise \u2018Eat You Up,\u2019 they refused,\u201d Lee recalled. \u201cIf we had changed it, I believe it would have achieved much better results.\u201d",
      "That setback taught Lee that K-pop needed to source global talent while maintaining creative control to adapt songs for the worldwide market. His quest for the perfect tracks took him worldwide.",
      "\u201cI once heard a song that was so good I couldn\u2019t let it go,\u201d he said, recalling the track that would later become \u201cDreams Come True\u201d for S.E.S., the late-1990s girl group. \u201cI could\u2019ve bought the license to the song in South Korea, Hong Kong, or Sweden. But I wanted to play it safe, so I found the Finnish address, went to meet the songwriter directly, wrote up a contract, and brought it back.\u201d",
      "At the time, top Western songwriters prioritized Japan, the world\u2019s second-largest music market. \u201cEuropean songwriters were willing to sell to Asia,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cThat\u2019s how we eventually built a system where music from Europe, Asia, and America could come together.\u201d",
      "That fusion became K-pop\u2019s signature. Lee also helped to pioneer another innovation: elaborate fictional universes, or \u201cworldviews,\u201d for groups like EXO and aespa \u2014 a storytelling approach that would later be adopted across the industry, including by groups like BTS.",
      "The concept emerged during his time in the U.S., where he witnessed MTV transform music into a visual medium. \u201cBut we only have three or four minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we express dramatic, cinematic elements in such a short time?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Florence Welch explores her desire for greatness and the constraints she faces as a female artist in Florence + the Machine's sixth album, \"Everybody Scream.\"",
      "During his acceptance speech for best actor at this year\u2019s Screen Actors Guild Awards, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet made known his desire to be remembered as \u201cone of the greats.\u201d A few years earlier, Chalamet starred in Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of \u201cLittle Women,\u201d in which his character demonstratively asks his future wife, \u201cWhat women are allowed into the club of geniuses, anyway?\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody Scream,\u201d Florence + the Machine\u2019s sixth album, is a response to that familiar, gendered notion. Across its 12 tracks, Florence Welch contends with both her desire for greatness and the constraints she understands to have been put on her as a female artist.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Welch had Chalamet\u2019s viral speech in mind when writing, \u201cOne of the Greats,\u201d the album\u2019s lead single. But what is apparent in her brooding feminist treatise are grievances about sexism and male entitlement. \u201cIt must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can,\u201d she belts over gothic synths and strings. But it's a bit funny, too: \"Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a fan, you\u2019re my second favorite frontman.\u201d",
      "Welch collaborated with Mark Bowen of IDLES for much of the record, as well as Mitski and Aaron Dessner of The National. Sometimes the collaborations create a haunting sound, but most of \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is packed with the band's signature orchestral pop, an ornate arrangement of strings, synths, guitars, pianos and percussion.",
      "Perhaps to a fault, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d isn\u2019t sonically dissimilar from what fans of Florence + the Machine have come to expect. But in a lyrical shift, Welch meditates heavily on mysticism and witchcraft throughout, something she turned to after suffering a nearly fatal ectopic pregnancy in 2023. The 39-year-old later revealed that she performed with a burst fallopian tube during her last tour and had to undergo emergency surgery.",
      "\u201cI sit in salt water/Call in a vision of my daughter/Light a candle/Place my grief upon the altar,\u201d her voice vibrates over haunting background vocals and an eerie electric guitar on \u201cYou Can Have It All.\u201d",
      "The record is reminiscent of Halsey\u2019s 2021 concept album, \u201cIf I Can\u2019t Have Love, I Want Power,\u201d where femininity and motherhood are juxtaposed with influence, respect and violence.",
      "There\u2019s a similar rawness to Welch\u2019s poetry, as she grapples with mortality and ambition. But, like life, it\u2019s also accompanied by the mundane. \u201cDownloading \u2018Revelations of Divine Love\u2019 on my phone/Trying to read but getting distracted/Trying to live but feeling so damaged,\u201d she sings on \u201cPerfume and Milk,\u201d one of the more austere songs on the album.",
      "As a concept, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is stellar. There\u2019s a sonic and thematic unity to the album and its Halloween release makes perfect sense.",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- When summer heat comes to the Arara neighborhood in northern Rio, it lingers, baking the red brick and concrete that make up many of the buildings long after the sun has gone down. Luis Cassiano, who's lived here more than 30 years, says he's getting worried as heat waves become more frequent and fierce.",
      "In poor areas such as Arara, those who can afford air conditioning \u2014 Cassiano is one \u2014 can't always count on it because of frequent power outages on an overloaded system. Cassiano gets some relief from the green roof he installed about a decade ago, which can keep his house up to 15 degrees Celsius (about 27 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than his neighbor's, but he still struggles to stay comfortable.",
      "\u201cThe sun in the summer nowadays is scary,\u201d Cassiano said.",
      "As world leaders come to Brazil for climate talks, people like Cassiano are the ones with the most at stake. Poor communities are often more vulnerable to hazards like extreme heat and supersized storms and less likely to have the resources to cope than wealthier places.",
      "Any help from the climate talks depends on countries not just laying out pledges and plans to lower emissions. They also need to find the political will to implement them, as well as come up with the billions of dollars needed to adapt everything from harvests to houses to better withstand human-caused climate change.",
      "All of it is sorely needed for the 1.1 billion people around the world who live in acute poverty, according to the United Nations.",
      "That's why many have lauded the choice of Belem, a relatively poor city, to host these talks.",
      "\u201cI am pleased that we will be going to a place like this, because this is where climate meets poverty, meets demand, meets financing needs, and meets the reality of the majority of the population of this world that are impacted by climate change,\u201d said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme.",
      "It's not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide. A U.N. Development Programme report found that even in highly developed countries, 82% of people living in poverty will be exposed to at least one of four climate hazards: high heat, drought, floods and air pollution.",
      "People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.",
      "They might not have the money to leave areas like inundated deltas or floodplains, landslide-prone hillsides or farmlands regularly scorched by drought. Nor to rebuild after a disaster hits. And those financial hits can be worsened by other problems like health issues, lack of education or lack of social mobility.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just, climate destroys buildings or bridges or property. It destroys the livelihoods of families. And if you don\u2019t have savings, that\u2019s really devastating,\u201d Brandon said.",
      "Even relatively developed countries with more ways to adapt will see some farm yields drop significantly, according to a UNDP analysis of global agriculture under different warming scenarios.",
      "But poorer countries will be more severely affected, said Heriberto Tapia, head of research and strategic partnerships advisor at the UNDP Human Development Report Office.",
      "Tapia said Africa, with more than 500 million people in poverty, is a big concern. Many depend on crop yields for their livelihoods.",
      "Most of the world's 550 million small agricultural producers are in low- or middle-income countries, working in marginal environments and more vulnerable to climate hazards, said Ismahane Elouafi, executive managing director of CGIAR, the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research.",

      "\u201cI heard there were a lot of negotiators who have been complaining of being put on a bunk bed, or in terms of sharing a room, but this is the reality of most people around the world,\u201d said Nafkote Dabi, climate policy lead at global development organization Oxfam. \u201cSo I think it makes things real.\u201d",
      "But some experts were skeptical, despite the recent UNDP report saying the need to take action is urgent.",
      "\u201cI wish that they had said more about what exactly is the rapid action that needs to be taken, because I don\u2019t think rapid action is going to come out of COP,\u201d said Kimberly Marion Suiseeya, an associate professor at Duke University who studies how international policies impact people in rural and forested areas.",
      "Although the public narrative has long been that humankind has generally been making progress on alleviating poverty, numbers show that now there\u2019s a \u201cstagnation,\u201d said Pedro Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, director of\u202fthe\u202fHuman Development Report Office at the UNDP. \u201cThe numbers are high and they are not budging.\u201d",
      "In a memo ahead of COP30, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates called for a shift from prioritizing reducing emissions to focus on reducing human suffering. On climate change, \u201cthere\u2019s no apocalyptic story for rich countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe place where it gets really tough is in these poor countries.\u201d",
      "But Concei\u00e7\u00e3o said it\u2019s wrong to think about poverty reduction and climate as a tradeoff.",
      "The idea that climate is only a future problem, \u201cor it\u2019s about things out there like glaciers melting, needs to be completely thrown out and replaced with the notion that actually the two agendas are one and the same,\u201d he said.",

      "Former Vice President Dick Cheney battled heart disease for most of his adult life, a life extended thanks in part to a heart transplant in 2012.",
      "Cheney, who died Monday due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, had his first heart attack at the unusually young age of 37. He would go on to survive four more before his heart declined enough to qualify for that transplant.",
      "Heart disease is the nation's No. 1 killer and Cheney's decades of health problems illustrate how heart trouble can accumulate \u2014 as well as the varied treatments.",
      "Over the years, Cheney underwent quadruple bypass surgery to reroute blood flow around clogged heart arteries as well as less invasive artery-clearing angioplasties. He had a pacemaker implanted to monitor his heartbeat. He also experienced blood vessel problems in his legs.",
      "Heart attacks damage the heart's muscle, eventually making it harder to pump properly. After Cheney's fifth heart attack in 2010, he acknowledged \u201cincreasing congestive heart failure.\u201d He received another implant, a small pump called a \u201cleft ventricular assist device\u201d or LVAD. That device took over the job of his heart's main pumping chamber, powered by batteries worn in a fanny pack.",

Cheney was older than a typical heart transplant recipient; most are 50 to 64 years old. But he was one of 362 people age 65 or older who received a new heart in 2012, according to the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, or OPTN.",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure yet many are never placed on the transplant list, in part because of the organ shortage. According to the organ network, 4,572 people received a heart transplant last year. That number of has grown gradually since Cheney's \u2014 there were 2,378 transplants in 2012. So have the number of recipients 65 or older \u2014 905 last year.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration on Friday moved to limit the use of fluoride supplements used to strengthen children's teeth, the latest action by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his deputies against a chemical that is a mainstay of dental care.",

      "\u201cFor the same reason fluoride may work to kill bacteria on teeth, it may also alter the gut microbiome, which may have broader health implications,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "The agency also sent a form letter to dentists and other health providers warning about the risks of the products.",
      "Those claims have been disputed by the American Dental Association, which has said there are no significant health problems associated with fluoride when used at the levels prescribed by dentists. The supplements can cause spotting or discoloration of teeth due to the extra fluoride, a downside the FDA also noted.",

      "The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for educators, wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for school leaders wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws. For Education Secretary Linda McMahon, it offers a preview of what she hopes to make permanent.",
      "Much of the department\u2019s work has gone completely cold. No new grants are being awarded, and civil rights investigations have been halted. Money is still flowing for key programs, but in many respects, schools and states are on their own.",
      "That\u2019s the vision President Donald Trump has promoted since his presidential campaign \u2014 a world where states fully have the reins of education policy with little or no influence from the federal government.",
      "Even before the shutdown, mass layoffs had left the agency with 2,400 employees, down from 4,100 when Trump took office. Remaining workers have mostly been furloughed during the budget impasse, leaving some 330 who are responsible for carrying out duties that are deemed essential.",
      "In a recent social media post, McMahon said the shutdown proves her department is unnecessary. \u201cTwo weeks in, millions of American students are still going to school, teachers are getting paid, and schools are operating as normal,\u201d McMahon wrote.",
      "She offered a more direct assessment days later, after the agency hit its 46th year: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a birthday cake,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe need an eviction notice.\u201d",
      "Some say the shutdown's impact has been more significant. They warn that funding for preschool centers and school meals is running out, and students with disabilities might not be getting the help they need.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the impact so far.",
      "Most of the billions of dollars the Education Department steers to schools each year went out the door in October, leaving schools funded until July.",
      "Other programs that aren\u2019t funded in advance face more uncertainty. That includes federally funded Head Start preschool centers and school nutrition programs funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said Julia Martin, director of policy and government affairs at the Bruman Group, an education law firm.",
      "Districts are required to cover the cost of school meals and then seek reimbursement from the Department of Agriculture, but the agency said it only has two months of reimbursements left amid the shutdown.",
      "\u201cDistricts are really worried that they\u2019re going to have to dig deep into their pockets to fund meals,\u201d Martin said.",
      "The last remnants of federal COVID-19 aid are still being released by the Education Department, but reimbursements have slowed with fewer staff reviewing the requests, Martin said.",
      "America\u2019s public schools are primarily funded by states and cities, but federal funding plays an important role. The billions sent already to schools include grants to help low-income students, those with disabilities and other populations.",
      "Grant competitions to award smaller amounts of money have largely frozen. Schools and states that already received grants can keep spending them down, but all new grantmaking has ceased, the department said. At the college level, federal Pell grants for low-income students are still flowing, and the FAFSA financial aid form is still being processed.",
      "Ordinarily, states and schools rely on the department to answer questions on a wide range of topics \u2014 from special education laws to statewide academic assessments to laws requiring public schools to provide certain services to students at private schools.",

      "Also gutted was the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which ensures that students with disabilities get the services they\u2019re entitled to under federal law. It maintains \u201cvery regular\u201d communication with states to field questions on coordinating aid to families and eliminating waitlists, said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, a disability rights group.",
      "The new layoffs have been halted by a federal judge. But as the shutdown drags on, more states are likely to break federal laws unknowingly because they can\u2019t get help from the government, said Neas, who led the special education office under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cPeople of good intention and good faith are going to have honest questions that they're not going to be able to get an answer for,\u201d Neas said.",
      "Some states have turned instead to law firms for advice, but there are not always clear answers. In August, the department rescinded 2015 guidance explaining schools\u2019 legal obligations to students who are learning English. But with no new guidance replacing it before the government shutdown, schools have questions about their responsibilities, said Martin, of the Bruman law firm.",
      "\u201cIn the meantime, a lot of districts are just going to continue to follow the old guidance because it\u2019s the best thing they have,\u201d Martin said.",

      "Runway shows became pop events, blurring the line between fashion show and stadium concert. The designer\u2019s inclusive casting and celebration of diversity helped redefine the image of a Paris house often associated with old-world exclusivity.",
      "Born in Bordeaux and adopted as an infant, Rousteing later learned that his biological parents were of Somali and Ethiopian origin \u2014 a revelation that he said deepened his sense of identity and creative mission.

      "Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum says the harassment she suffered from a drunk man near the government seat is an assault on all women",
      "MEXICO CITY -- What should have been a five-minute time-saving walk from Mexico\u2019s National Palace to the Education Ministry for President Claudia Sheinbaum has become a stomach-churning viral moment after a video captured a drunk man groping the president.",
      "The brief clip has given the daily harassment and assaults that women suffer in Mexico their highest-profile platform. And on Wednesday, Sheinbaum used her daily press briefing to say that she had pressed charges against the man.",
      "She also called on states to look at their laws and procedures to make it easier for women to report such assaults and said Mexicans needed to hear a \u201cloud and clear, no, women\u2019s personal space must not be violated.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum said she felt a responsibility to press charges, because if not, where would that leave Mexican women? \u201cIf this is done to the president, what is going to happen to all of the young women in our country?\u201d",
      "Indeed, if Mexico\u2019s president cannot be in the street for five minutes without a man approaching her from behind, putting his hands on her body and leaning in for a kiss, then it\u2019s not difficult to imagine what women with hours-long commutes on public transportation are experiencing daily.",
      "Andrea Gonz\u00e1lez Mart\u00ednez, 27, who works for Mexican lender Nacional Monte de Piedad, said she has been harassed on public transportation, in one case the man followed her home.",
      "\u201cIt happens regularly, it happens on public transportation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you experience every day in Mexico.\u201d",
      "Her coworker, Carmen Maldonado Castillo, 43, said she has witnessed it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not good that men attack us,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk around free in the street.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum said Wednesday that she understands how widespread the problem is.",
      "\u201cI decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\u201d she said.",
      "She said she had similar experiences of harassment when she was 12 years old and using public transportation to get to school. As president, she said, she felt like she had a responsibility to all women.",

      "She explained that she and her team had decided to walk from the National Palace to the Education Ministry to save time. She said they could walk it in five minutes, rather than taking a 20-minute car ride.",
      "Brugada used some of Sheinbaum\u2019s own language about being elected Mexico\u2019s first woman president to emphasize that harassment of any woman \u2013 in this case Mexico\u2019s most powerful \u2013 is an assault on all women.",
      "When Sheinbaum was elected, she said that it wasn\u2019t just her coming to power, it was all women. Brugada said that was \u201cnot a slogan, it\u2019s a commitment to not look the other way, to not allow misogyny to continue to be veiled in habits, to not accept a single additional humiliation, not another abuse, not a single femicide more.\u201d",
      "Lilian Valvuena, 31, said she didn\u2019t think Sheinbaum had really taken violence against women seriously until yesterday when she had a first-hand experience. She hopes that work to better train police to respond will follow.",
      "\u201cThey have to prepare them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what protocols to follow.\u201d",
      "Marina Reyna, executive director of the Guerrero Association against Violence toward Women, said that watching the video she initially worried that Sheinbaum had minimized the assault, continuing to smile and talk calmly to the man. But she hoped the president's willingness to talk about it Wednesday would change how such cases are handled.",
      "\u201cYou lose confidence in the institutions,\u201d Reyna said. \u201cThe people stop going to report it, because when you report it nothing happens.\u201d",

      "Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York mayoral race inspires many in Uganda, though it feels distant",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- The opposition leader in the Ugandan Parliament sees the Ugandan-born Zohran Mamdani\u2019s victory in the New York mayoral race as an inspiring political shift but somehow too distant for many Africans at home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big encouragement even to us here in Uganda that it\u2019s possible,\u201d said Joel Ssenyonyi, who represents an area of the Ugandan capital of Kampala. \u201cBut we have a long way to get there.\u201d",
      "Uganda, where Mamdani was born in 1991, has had the same president for nearly four decades, despite attempts by multiple opposition leaders to defeat him in elections. President Yoweri Museveni, an authoritarian who is up for reelection in January, has rejected calls to retire, leading to fears of a volatile political transition. His most prominent challenger is a 43-year-old entertainer known as Bobi Wine, who charges he was cheated in the 2021 election.",
      "Mamdani lived his early years in Uganda. He left Uganda at the age of 5 to follow his father, political theorist Mahmood Mamdani, in South Africa and later moved to the United States. He kept his Ugandan citizenship even after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018.",
      "His mother is filmmaker Mira Nair, whose work has been nominated for an Academy Award. The family maintains a home in Kampala, to which they regularly return and visited earlier this year to celebrate Mamdani's marriage.",
      "The elder Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, is known as a demanding teacher and a key influence in the son\u2019s outlook as a leading scholar in the field of postcolonial studies.",
      "He has written critically of the Museveni government. His most recent book \u2014 \u201cSlow Poison,\u201d published in October by Harvard University Press \u2014 has juxtaposed the legacies of Museveni and late dictator Idi Amin, who is blamed for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans between 1971 and 1979. He argues that both leaders made violence central to their success and that while Amin retained popular support and didn\u2019t die a millionaire, Museveni's family is immensely wealthy while he's no longer popular.",
      "Robert Kabushenga, a retired media executive who is friendly with the Mamdani family, said Zohran Mamdani, like his parents, is unconventional. He \u201cfollows a tradition of very honest and clear thinkers who are willing to reimagine the politics,\u201d said Kabushenga. \u201c(His father) must be pleasantly surprised.\u201d",
      "Mamdani's victory in New York offers \u201ca beacon of hope\u201d for embattled activists and others in Uganda. The lesson is that \u201cwe should allow young people the opportunity to shape, and participate in, politics in a meaningful way,\u201d Kabushenga said.",
      "Okello Ogwang, a professor of literature who has worked with the elder Mamdani at Uganda's Makerere University, said the son's success abroad means \u201cit's an important thing that we should invest in the youth.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe's coming from here,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don't invest in our youth, we are wasting our time.\u201d",

      "The European Union has announced plans to slash carbon emissions by 90% by 2040",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union said Wednesday it would slash carbon emissions by 90% by 2040, in an agreement widely seen as a weakening of the 27-nation bloc's previous climate goals, after an overnight debate ahead of the U.N. climate conference in Brazil.",
      "Hungary, Slovakia and Poland voted against the agreement, despite other nations agreeing to key compromises including allowing flexibility for member states to buy carbon credits internationally to reach their emissions targets and for the EU to reassess its climate policy depending on economic performance. The agreement also allows for postponing a new carbon trading plan covering transport and heating, a central demand of Poland.",
      "Environmentalists criticized the deal for provisions that will allow the EU to buy carbon credits from less-developed countries, effectively outsourcing the bloc's obligations. \u201cThe use of offshore carbon laundering to meet this nominal target means the EU\u2019s own commitment is much lower, and that commitment means even less with a baked-in clause to dilute the target every two years,\u201d said Greenpeace EU climate campaigner Thomas Gelin. Jeroen Gerlag, Europe director at the nonprofit Climate Group, said that \u201cwhile the EU keeps its 90% commitment on paper, in effect it\u2019ll be offshoring some of its emission reductions \u2013 making it someone else\u2019s problem.\u201d",
      "The agreement was hammered out between EU climate ministers in a marathon session overnight into Wednesday morning. Before it becomes a legally-binding document, the European Parliament will vote on it and negotiate its contents with the European Council.",
      "\u201cThis is exactly the signal that Europe has to send in these times,\u201d said Swedish climate minister Romina Pourmokhtari, who thanked Finland, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands for pushing for high emissions cuts in the debate.",
      "Wopke Hoekstra, the European Commissioner for Climate, Net-Zero and Clean Growth, said the agreement is strong compared to those of allies in the Pacific, Europe and North America, but that some compromise was necessary amid current geopolitical and economic tension.",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s government said Wednesday it has started a procedure to suspend access to Shein\u2019s online platform until the company proves that its content conforms with French law, after a a controversy over sex dolls with childlike features that were found listed on the fast-fashion giant's website.",
      "The decision, announced in a terse statement by the Finance Ministry, came on the same day Shein opened its first permanent store in Paris inside one of the city\u2019s most iconic department stores.",
      "The opening drew crowds of shoppers as well as protesters at the BHV Marais, including a small group of demonstrators waving anti-Shein signs who briefly disrupted the opening day before they were escorted out by security.",
      "The ministry did not say whether its decision would impact the physical store, or elaborate on the reasons for its decision. It only said that a first progress report would be provided within the next 48 hours.",
      "In response, Shein pledged to work with French authorities to \u201caddress any concerns swiftly as we have always done and we are seeking dialogue with the authorities and government bodies on this issue.\"",
      "French authorities have legal power to order online platforms to remove clearly illegal content such as child pornography within 24 hours. If they fail to comply, authorities can require internet service providers and search engines to block access and delist the site.",

      "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Merlin, president of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Grands Magasins, which owns BHV, praised the government's move, adding that Shein had already chosen to suspend its marketplace. \u201cI am satisfied with this decision and I hope that, in the end, we will be able to stop selling illicit products on these marketplaces,\u201d Merlin said.",
      "Even before the backlash over the sex doll listings, the decision by Shein to launch its first physical store in the heart of France\u2019s fashion capital had faced criticism from environmental groups, Paris City Hall, and France\u2019s ready-to-wear industry.",
      "The retail giant has long drawn criticism over its poor green credentials and labor practices.",
      "Shein said earlier that it has banned all sex-doll products, and temporarily removed its adult products category for review. The company had also announced that it would temporarily suspend listings from independent third-party vendors in its marketplace, and launched an investigation to determine how the dolls listings bypassed its screening measures.",

      "Over the last century, yodeling clubs sprouted up in Switzerland, building upon the tradition and broadening its appeal \u2014 with its tones, techniques and tremolos finding their way deeper into the musical lexicon internationally in classical, jazz and folk.

Yodeling exists in neighboring Austria, Germany and Italy, but Swiss yodeling is distinctive because of its vocal technique, she said.",
      "In its early days, yodeling involved chants of wordless vowel sounds, or \u201cnatural yodeling,\u201d with melodies but no lyrics. More recently, \u201cyodeling song\u201d has included verses and a refrain.",
      "The Swiss government says at least 12,000 yodelers take part through about 780 groups of the Swiss Yodeling Association.",
      "In Switzerland, R\u00e4ss said, yodeling is built on the \u201csound colors of the voice\u201d and features two types: one centering on the head \u2014 with a \u201cu\u201d sound \u2014 and one emanating from deeper down in the chest \u2014 with an \u201co\u201d sound.",
      "And even within Switzerland, styles vary: Yodeling in the northern region near Appenzell is more \u201cmelancholic, slower,\u201d while in the country's central regions, the sounds are \u201cmore intense and shorter,\u201d she said.",
      "What began as mostly a male activity is now drawing more women in a country that adopted universal suffrage in 1971. The Appenzell-Innerrhoden region only gave equal voting rights to women in local elections in 1990, following a high court ruling.",

      "Full-size three-row SUVs can fulfill many needs, with room for more than five passengers, a large cargo area, and the ability to pull a heavy trailer",
      "Let\u2019s say you need a vehicle with room for more than five passengers, a large cargo area, and the ability to pull a heavy trailer. A full-size three-row SUV should work well, but which one? The most significant news this year is the redesigned Ford Expedition. Ford has given its biggest SUV a complete makeover with a more upscale interior, new technology features and a novel split-opening tailgate.",
      "It\u2019s a compelling pick for a big SUV, but it\u2019s not the only one vying for your attention. The GMC Yukon got its own refresh for 2025. It\u2019s not as comprehensive as the Expedition\u2019s, but it too features a significant interior and technology overhaul that further distances it from its mechanical twin, the Chevy Tahoe. Edmunds\u2019 auto experts tested both to determine which one is the better buy.",
      "The Expedition has a turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 in two versions. The standard-output V6 produces 400 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque, while the high-output version pumps out 440 horsepower and 510 lb-ft. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 19 mpg combined with standard rear-wheel drive and 18 mpg combined with optional four-wheel drive.",
      "The Yukon\u2019s engine choices are an interesting contrast. The standard 5.3-liter V8 produces 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft, while the 6.2-liter V8 standard on top trim levels has a more competitive 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft. Fuel economy is up to 17 mpg combined for the 5.3-liter V8; the 6.2-liter gets 16 mpg combined.",
      "At the Edmunds test track, an Expedition with the high-output V6 accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. That\u2019s a second quicker than the Yukon with its bigger V8. The Yukon does have an efficiency ace up its sleeve, however. You can get an optional turbodiesel six-cylinder that makes 305 horsepower and 495 lb-ft and gets up to an EPA-estimated 23 mpg combined.",
      "Space and towing",
      "Third-row space is exceptional in both, especially for tall teens or adults. On paper, though, the Expedition has a slight advantage with its 36.5 inches of third-row legroom compared to the Yukon\u2019s 34.9 inches.",
      "Their respective specs also indicate the Yukon has more cargo space. However, in Edmunds\u2019 testing, Ford\u2019s full-size SUV could hold more pieces of luggage behind its third row seat. Specifically, the cargo area is wider back there.",
      "For really big gear hauling, the Expedition can tow a maximum of 9,600 pounds. The Yukon maxes out at 8,400 pounds.",
      "Advantage: Ford Expedition",
      "Both of these SUVs are well-suited for big families. There are subtle differences, however. The Expedition\u2019s greatest strength is undoubtedly space. There\u2019s ample room for passengers in every seat, and the seats are comfortable, especially for the driver and front passenger. We like them better than the Yukon\u2019s front seats for comfort on long drives. We\u2019ve also found that the Expedition has less wind and road noise on the highway than the Yukon.",

      "Most SUVs based on trucks are subject to undue vibrations and reverberations throughout the cabin, but the Expedition keeps those to a minimum. It also has a smooth ride over bumps and ruts. The Yukon offers an optional adaptive air suspension that can adjust the SUV\u2019s ride height and automatically soften the shock absorbers to help smooth out the ride even further, but overall we\u2019ve found the Expedition more relaxing and comfortable to drive.",
      "Advantage: Ford Expedition",
      "The GMC Yukon has a distinctive 16.8-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen that features a Google-based operating system. The Google integration provides the familiarity of Google Maps and other Google features, such as the voice-based Assistant app. There is an 11-inch digital instrument panel as well with customizable layouts and information. This is a very good tech package that Edmunds rates highly for its functionality and feature content.",
      "That said, we rate the Expedition\u2019s system even higher. It consists of a 13.2-inch touchscreen interface that works in concert with an enormous 24-inch ultra-wide dash-top screen that acts as a combination instrument panel and customizable secondary display for the touchscreen. These screens are bright and easy to read and don\u2019t feel like tech for tech\u2019s sake \u2014 they actually improve functionality.",
      "Both SUVs offer hands-free highway driving assist technology: GMC\u2019s is called Super Cruise and Ford\u2019s is called BlueCruise. Both are effective and reliable, and if either enjoys the slightest advantage, it\u2019s the GMC thanks to its light-up steering wheel that makes it perfectly obvious when the system is operating or needs your attention.",
      "Advantage: Ford Expedition",
      "While the Yukon is luxurious, comfortable and packed with impressive technology features, the Ford Expedition quite simply outdoes it in most respects. It also boasts multiple high-end trim levels that easily hold their own against the top trims of the Yukon for luxury appeal.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s power to unilaterally impose far-reaching tariffs is coming before the Supreme Court in a pivotal test of executive power with trillion-dollar implications for the global economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s power to unilaterally impose far-reaching tariffs is coming before the Supreme Court on Wednesday in a pivotal test of executive power with trillion-dollar implications for the global economy.",
      "The Republican administration is trying to defend the tariffs central to Trump's economic agenda after lower courts ruled the emergency law he invoked doesn\u2019t give him near-limitless power to set and change duties on imports.",
      "The Constitution says Congress has the power to levy tariffs. But the Trump administration argues that in emergency situations the president can regulate importation taxes like tariffs. Trump has called the case one of the most important in the country\u2019s history and said a ruling against him would be catastrophic for the economy.",
      "The challengers argue the 1977 emergency powers law Trump used doesn\u2019t even mention tariffs, and no president before has used it to impose them. A collection of small businesses say the uncertainty is driving them to the brink of bankruptcy.",
      "The case centers on two sets of tariffs. The first came in February on imports from Canada, China and Mexico after Trump declared a national emergency over drug trafficking. The second involves the sweeping \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on most countries that Trump announced in April.",
      "Multiple lawsuits have been filed over the tariffs, and the court will hear suits filed by Democratic-leaning states and small businesses focused on everything from plumbing supplies to women's cycling apparel.",
      "Lower courts have struck down the bulk of his tariffs as an illegal use of emergency power, but the nation\u2019s highest court may see it differently.",
      "Trump helped shape the conservative majority court, naming three of the justices in his first term. The justices have so far been reluctant to check his extraordinary flex of executive power, handing him a series of wins on its emergency docket.",
      "Still, those have been short-term orders \u2014 little of Trump\u2019s wide-ranging conservative agenda has been fully argued before the nation\u2019s highest court. That means the outcome could set the tone for wider legal pushback against his policies.",
      "The justices have been skeptical of executive power claims before, such as when then-President Joe Biden tried to forgive $400 billion in student loans under a different law dealing with national emergencies. The Supreme Court found the law didn\u2019t clearly give him the power to enact a program with such a big economic impact, a legal principle known as the major questions doctrine.",
      "The challengers say Trump\u2019s tariffs should get the same treatment, since they\u2019ll have a much greater economic effect, raising some $3 trillion over the next decade. The government, on the other hand, says the tariffs are different because they\u2019re a major part of his approach to foreign affairs, an area where the courts should not be second-guessing the president.",

      "The challengers are also trying to channel the conservative justices\u2019 skepticism about whether the Constitution allows other parts of the government to use powers reserved for Congress, a concept known as the nondelegation doctrine. Trump\u2019s interpretation of the law could mean anyone who can \u201cregulate\u201d can also impose taxes, they say.",
      "The Justice Department counters that legal principle is for governmental agencies, not for the president.",
      "If he eventually loses at the high court, Trump could impose tariffs under other laws, but those have more limitations on the speed and severity with which he could act. The aftermath of a ruling against him also could be complicated, if the government must issue refunds for the tariffs that had collected $195 billion in revenue as of September.",
      "The Trump administration did win over four appeals court judges who found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, gives the president authority to regulate importation during emergencies without explicit limitations. In recent decades, Congress has ceded some tariff authority to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.",

      "The plane crashed about 5:15 p.m. as it was departing for Honolulu from UPS Worldport at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport.",
      "Video showed flames on the plane\u2019s left wing and a trail of smoke. The plane then lifted slightly off the ground before crashing and exploding in a huge fireball. Video also revealed portions of a building\u2019s shredded roof next to the end of the runway.",
      "The death toll had risen to at least seven Tuesday night, and four of those killed were not on the plane, officials said.",

      "UPS\u2019s largest package handling facility is in Louisville and the company announced Tuesday night that it had halted package sorting at the center and didn\u2019t say when it would resume. The hub employs thousands of workers, has 300 daily flights and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.",
      "\u201cWe all know somebody who works at UPS,\u201d Louisville Metro Council member Betsy Ruhe said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re all texting their friends, their family, trying to make sure everyone is safe. Sadly, some of those texts are probably going to go unanswered.\u201d",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy predicted Tuesday that there could be chaos in the skies next week if the government shutdown drags on and air traffic controllers miss a second paycheck.",
      "There have already been numerous delays at airports across the country \u2014 sometimes hours long \u2014 because the Federal Aviation Administration slows down or stops traffic temporarily anytime it is short on controllers. Last weekend saw some of the worst staff shortages and on Sunday, flights at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey were delayed for several hours.",
      "Duffy and the head of the air traffic controllers union have both warned that the situation will only get worse the longer the shutdown continues and the financial pressure continues to grow on people who are forced to work without pay. FAA employees already missed one paycheck on Oct. 28. Their next payday is scheduled for next Tuesday.",
      "\u201cMany of the controllers said \u2018A lot of us can navigate missing one paycheck. Not everybody, but a lot of us can. None of us can manage missing two paychecks,\u2019\u201d Duffy said. \u201cSo if you bring us to a week from today, Democrats, you will see mass chaos. You will see mass flight delays. You\u2019ll see mass cancellations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace, because we just cannot manage it because we don\u2019t have air traffic controllers.\u201d",
      "Most of the flight disruptions so far during the shutdown have been isolated and temporary. But if delays become more widespread and start to ripple throughout the system, the pressure will mount on Congress to reach an agreement to end the shutdown.",
      "It's difficult to predict how much worse the situation will get once controllers miss a second paycheck. The impact of the staff shortages could also be magnified if controllers coordinated a large effort to call out sick across a certain region of the country. Both the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and Duffy have urged controllers not to consider that and continue reporting to work.",
      "Mike McCormick, who used to oversee air traffic control for the FAA before he retired and is now a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said closing down part of the airspace and forcing planes to fly around an area is routinely done when there is a major thunderstorm. The FAA may also close down part of the airspace if it is short on controllers at one of its regional radar centers that directs planes flying at high altitude across the country. This move is very similar to a ground delay program that FAA uses at an airport when it is short on controllers there or encounters an equipment failure.",

      "Normally, airlines strive to have at least 80% of their flights depart and arrive within 15 minutes of when they are scheduled. Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the total number of delays overall has not fallen significantly below that goal because most of the disruptions so far have been no worse than what happens when a major thunderstorm moves across an airport.",
      "But on Sunday, only about 56% of Newark's departures were on time, and the Orlando airport reported that only about 70% of its flights were on time, according to Cirium.",
      "As of midday Tuesday, there have been 1,932 flight delays reported across the United States, according to www.FlightAware.com. That is lower than what is typical although the FAA did say that flights in Phoenix were being delayed Tuesday morning because of staffing shortages.

      "Closing arguments have been presented in McLaren Racing\u2019s lawsuit against IndyCar star Alex Palou",
      "Closing arguments were presented Wednesday in McLaren Racing\u2019s breach of contract suit against IndyCar star Alex Palou, who signed two different contracts with the team before deciding not to leave Chip Ganassi Racing because he presumed McLaren would never give the Spaniard a seat in Formula 1.",
      "The five-week trial in London\u2019s High Court began in late September and it is unclear when a ruling will be issued. McLaren initially sought almost $30 million in damages, but that number was reduced to $20.7 million as the racing juggernaut seeks to reclaim money allegedly lost in sponsorship, driver salaries and performance earnings.",
      "Palou has won three consecutive IndyCar titles and the Indianapolis 500 since this saga began. He has four IndyCar titles in the last five seasons.",
      "Palou first signed with McLaren in 2022 to drive for its IndyCar team in 2023, but Ganassi pushed back and exercised an option on Palou for the 2023 season. The matter was decided through mediation, with McLaren covering Palou\u2019s legal costs. Palou could not join McLaren until 2024 but was permitted to be the reserve and test driver for the F1 team in 2023.",
      "When McLaren signed Oscar Piastri for its F1 team, and Palou\u2019s performance with Ganassi in IndyCar was so dominant, the driver decided he did not want to move to McLaren\u2019s IndyCar team and reneged on his contract.",
      "Palou has maintained his contracts with McLaren were \u201cbased on lies,\u201d and he\u2019d never have a chance to race in F1. His counsel has also accused McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown of destroying evidence by deleting WhatsApp messages related to the case.",
      "McLaren contends it lost revenue when Palou backed out ahead of the 2024 season and the team had to scramble to find another driver. McLaren wanted Indianapolis 500 winner Marcus Ericsson, who had already committed to Andretti Global, so it instead used four different drivers that season.",
      "Because none were as accomplished as Palou, McLaren argued both NTT Data and General Motors reduced their payouts to the team because McLaren did not field a driver of the caliber it had promised.",
      "Palou\u2019s attorneys have argued that McLaren driver Nolan Siegel is funded by his wealthy father and that covers any financial losses from sponsors. McLaren said it views Siegel only as a promising young driver it did not sign for money.",
      "\u201cMcLaren has been happy to settle with Mr. Siegel in Car #6 because recruiting a pay driver for that seat was itself a step taken to mitigate any losses (including such losses as might otherwise flow from the fact that Mr. Siegel is one of the worst drivers on the grid),\u201d Palou\u2019s side argued, according to court documents. \u201cBy recruiting Mr. Siegel, McLaren Indy has in fact mitigated its loss entirely. That is in turn precisely the reason why McLaren has proven happy to sit back and take Mr. Siegel\u2019s money for as long as the contract provides for the same, as opposed to continue shopping in the driver market for an even better driver.\u201d",
      "Siegel finished 22nd in this season\u2019s standings, better than only five other full-time drivers.",

      "Palou claims he owes nothing and was misled over potential F1 opportunities. McLaren\u2019s lineup has won two consecutive constructors' championships in F1 and Lando Norris and Piastri are currently 1-2 in the driver championship standings. Both are younger than Palou, who figures his window has closed on a seat in F1 as he turns 29 in April.",
      "Palou\u2019s defense has also argued that because the driver remained with Ganassi, and Ganassi said the IndyCar team would mitigate his legal losses, it comes at the expense of Palou\u2019s salary. He\u2019s been the best driver in IndyCar the last three years but is not among the highest paid.",
      "\u201cAs we have seen the big numbers that have been claimed in this matter is something that I do not have as a person, as a driver,\u201d Palou testified. \u201cThere is no way I would have had the amount of money and expenses just to be here today. Although there is that indemnity, as a driver, I know I am not being paid the amount of other drivers. I am not in the top three of the highest-paid drivers and I am not going to be for the foreseeable future\u2026 for this indemnity. I am going to have to pay for it with my base salary in the future and I am already doing it.\u201d",
      "Palou\u2019s defense has zeroed in on McLaren personnel\u2019s use of the disappearing messages function on WhatsApp. The messages self-delete under that setting and thus communication related to the Palou saga has vanished.",
      "\u201cIn an ordinary case, the court can place weight upon the contemporaneous documentary record as representing the best evidence of what occurred,\u201d Palou\u2019s lawyers said. \u201c(F)rom the very beginning, McLaren\u2019s approach has been to carefully curate the documentary record in such a way as to try and inflate the value of their claim, whilst simultaneously deleting and destroying or otherwise suppressing any evidence which might be adverse to their claim.\u201d",
      "The case revealed that Palou had options in his McLaren contract that would permit him to be a reserve driver for another F1 team in 2027 so long as he did not race for another IndyCar team. His revised McLaren contract was set to run for the 2024, 2025 and 2026 seasons.",
      "Palou\u2019s defense argued that an agreement had been reached in which Brown would let Palou out of his contract to drive for an F1 team with a release fee of $2 million to $2.5 million, skeptically noting the $20.7 million sought by the McLaren executive.",
      "\u201cLosses of the magnitude now alleged by McLaren are simply not credible, and each alleged head of loss falls apart under proper scrutiny,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",

      "But a day after trading two of the biggest stars in Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams, it was clear the Jets are in a major rebuild during which patience will need to precede pride.",
      "\u201cIt was a pretty intense day,\u201d Glenn acknowledged Wednesday.",
      "And for many of the players, coaches and fans, a stunning and sad one.",
      "Gardner was traded to Indianapolis on Tuesday for a first-round draft pick in 2026 and another in 2027, along with wide receiver Adonai Mitchell. A few hours later, Williams was dealt to Dallas for a second-round pick in 2026, a first-round selection in 2027 and defensive tackle Mazi Smith.",
      "Gardner and Williams were thought to be key parts of the foundation that both Glenn and Mougey are trying to set for the Jets' future while attempting to return the franchise to respectability.",
      "\u201cWhen an opportunity presents itself for us to be able to build this team, it's hard to pass it up,\u201d Glenn said. \"Listen, those two guys are great players, we all know that. All-Pro players. The one constant in this league is change.",
      "\u201cAnd I've said that to all our players, not just today but throughout this season, that this is a fluid game. Players come and go. Coaches come and go. But the one thing I do know is with change, there comes opportunity.\u201d",
      "While both Gardner and Williams are now on teams trying to reach the playoffs, the 1-7 Jets are likely going to miss the postseason for the 15th straight year. And that was clear even before the franchise-altering moves.",

      "When Glenn was hired, he preached patience and the process. That has been a tough sell to the fanbase, though. And now they have to watch their team play out the string of the last nine games without two of their best players, first-round picks who were once symbols of hope.",

      "The Aramco Championship will be held from April 2-5 at Shadow Creek with 120 players from the LPGA and the Ladies European Tour. The $4 million purse rates among the highest outside the majors.",
      "It's the first big announcement for Craig Kessler, who took over as LPGA commissioner in July. He said the Aramco Championship \u201creflects exactly where we're headed in building the global schedule for our tour.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe often talk about routing, courses and purses, and this event checks every box,\" Kessler said. \u201cWe also recognize that partnerships like this \u2014 built on LET's longstanding collaboration with Golf Saudi and PIF \u2014 can help strengthen the women's game on a global scale and elevate opportunities for our athletes.\u201d",
      "The Aramco Championship is one of five tournaments that make up the series, which the Public Investment Fund rebranded this year while raising the prize money.",

      "Epic and Google revealed the settlement agreement in a joint legal document they filed in a San Francisco federal court Tuesday.",
      "They said it \u201cwould allow the parties to put their disputes aside while making Android a more vibrant and competitive platform for users and developers.\u201d",
      "Epic, which makes the hit online game Fortnite, won a victory over the summer when a federal appeals court upheld a jury verdict condemning Google\u2019s Android app store as an illegal monopoly. The unanimous ruling cleared the way for a federal judge to enforce a potentially disruptive shake-up that\u2019s designed to give consumers more choices.",

That included a provision that will require its app store to distribute rival third-party app stores so consumers can download them to their phones, if they so desire.",
      "Google had hoped to void those changes with an appeal, but the ruling issued in July by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals delivered a legal blow for the tech giant, which has been waylaid in three separate antitrust trials affecting different pillars of its internet empire.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national pride that South Korea, which spends 1.4 times North Korea\u2019s annual GDP on defense and is perceived as the world\u2019s fifth most powerful military, continues to depend on others for its security,\u201d Lee said.",
      "During his meeting with Trump, Lee reaffirmed South Korea\u2019s commitment to increase defense spending and called for U.S. support for South Korean efforts to acquire nuclear-powered submarines.",

      "Lee\u2019s speech came as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and South Korean Defense Minister Ahn Gyu-back were meeting in Seoul for the allies\u2019 annual security talks. The meeting is expected to address key alliance issues, including South Korea\u2019s defense spending commitments and the implementation of a plan to transfer wartime operational control to a joint command led by a South Korean general with a U.S. deputy.",

      "Lambert, a critically endangered African penguin, has moved to a special geriatric island at the New England Aquarium in Boston",
      "BOSTON -- When Lambert started losing his vision and slowing down a few steps, it became clear that he needed to be relocated to a place where he could age safely and still be with his friends.",
      "But he couldn't be placed in just any nursing home \u2014 because he is a critically endangered African penguin. Instead, the New England Aquarium in Boston, where the 33-year-old Lambert was born and has lived his entire life, decided in February to open a geriatric island for him and its six other aging penguins.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it sort of started off as a joke. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, well, why don\u2019t we give them an old folks home?\u2019\u201d Eric Fox, associate curator of penguins at the aquarium, said. \u201cBut the more we were looking at their welfare data and understanding what ailments they go through, what physical limitations they have, we started to realize that we were on to something.\u201d",
      "The rocky island near the aquarium entrance is set apart from the rest of the 38-bird colony, ensuring the older penguins don't have to compete for territory with their often aggressive, younger peers. These penguins, with their trademark black and white feathers, stand about 2 feet (0.6 meters) tall and weigh about as much as a large house cat.",
      "The enclosure has some flatter topography and a carpeted path down to the water, which allows Lambert and the other penguins to better navigate up and down the island. The aquarium has built a stand in front of the island, which makes it easier for the penguins to hop out of the water.",
      "As a result, Mia Luzietti, a senior penguin trainer at the aquarium, said she has seen Lambert become more active since moving to the new island \u2014 swimming more with his mate and getting off the island more often.",
      "The concept was inspired by a larger concern that is confronting zoos and aquariums around the world \u2014 what to do when their animals are surviving far longer than their counterparts in the wild. In the case of these African penguins, some are in their 30s and one lived into its 40s. That is twice as long as they would live in the wilds of South Africa and Namibia, due to threats like pollution and lack of food from humans\u2019 overfishing.",
      "\u201cIt's really important that, as we learned how long these animals could live, if given an optimal environment, that we evolved with that,\u201d Luzietti said.",
      "\u201cSo learning on an individual level, how can we best set our animals up for success is really what led to the idea of creating our geriatric island, a place where our oldest penguins have a more comfortable, slower way of life as they live out their days here,\u201d she added.",

      "Caring for the aging penguins goes far beyond a safer enclosure.",
      "The older birds get more checkups than their younger counterparts, and veterinarians offer them treatment for ailments that might be familiar to older humans \u2014 such as supplements and anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis and joint pain, and eye drops for glaucoma. There are also more cameras around the island, so staff can better monitor the birds.",
      "\u201cWe are just keeping a little closer of an eye on some of these older birds,\u201d Luzietti said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re picking up on those \u2014 from how someone\u2019s hips are moving, how they\u2019re walking, how they are acting, if someone\u2019s squinting. The smallest change day to day can be hiding a really big secret.\u201d",
      "On a recent day, Luzietti was in the geriatric enclosure tending to Lambert \u2014 who seemed content to stand at the top of the island with his mate Dyer III, preening one another and occasionally letting out a loud call that sounded like a donkey's bray. He previously had his left eye removed due to an infection and has glaucoma in his right eye. He also suffers from chronic inflammation.",
      "Luzietti coaxed him down from his perch, and soon he was sitting on her lap, getting ready for his daily dose of eye drops.",
      "A crowd had formed around the enclosure to watch, including Terri Blessman, a 69-year-old tourist from Canton, Illinois, who was being pushed in a wheelchair by her friend Lou Ann Delost. Hearing about Lambert's age and the care he gets, Blessman said she could relate.",
      "\u201cThat's wonderful,\u201d Blessman said. \u201cAll of us older people need extra care as we get older.\u201d",

      "Record labels have accused the platforms of exploiting the recorded works of artists without compensating them.",
      "In its lawsuit filed against Udio last year, Universal sought to show how specific AI-generated songs made on Udio closely resembled Universal-owned classics like Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cMy Way,\u201d The Temptations\u2019 \u201cMy Girl,\" ABBA's \u201cDancing Queen\u201d and holiday favorites like \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d and \u201cJingle Bell Rock.\u201d",
      "A musician-led group, the Artist Rights Alliance, said Friday that the Universal-Udio settlement represents a positive step in creating a \u201clegitimate AI marketplace\u201d but raised questions about whether independent artists, session musicians and songwriters will be sufficiently protected from AI practices that present an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to their careers.",
      "\u201cLicensing is the only version of AI\u2019s future that doesn\u2019t result in the mass destruction of art and culture,\" the group said. \u201cBut this promise must be available to all music creators, not just to major corporate copyright holders.\u201d",

That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA.",
      "November's supermoon is the second of three supermoons this year and also the closest: The moon will come within just under 222,000 miles (357,000 kilometers) of Earth.",
      "Tides may be slightly higher during a supermoon because the moon is closer to Earth, said astronomer Lawrence Wasserman with Lowell Observatory. But the difference isn't very noticeable.",

      "The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.",
      "Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59, spilling wooden crates labeled \u201clive monkeys\u201d into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.",
      "Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the driver's name, the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn't own them and won't identify who does.",
      "The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.",
      "\u201cWhen a truck carrying 21 monkeys crashes on a public highway, the community has a right to know who owned those animals, where they were being sent, and what diseases they may have been exposed to and harbored simply by being caught up in the primate experimentation industry,\u201d said Lisa Jones-Engel, senior science adviser on primate experimentation with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.",

      "Transporting research animals typically requires legally binding contracts that prevent the parties involved from disclosing information, Tulane University said in a statement to The Associated Press. That's done for the safety of the animals and to protect proprietary information, the New Orleans-based university said.",
      "\u201cTo the best of Tulane\u2019s knowledge, the 13 recovered animals remain in the possession of their owner and are en route to their original destination,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The crash has drawn a range of reactions \u2014 from conspiracy theories that suggest a government plot to sicken people to serious responses from people who oppose experimenting on animals.",

Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, set up traps to capture them. However, some spent two months that winter living in the woods and weathering a rare snowstorm.

The monkeys were headed to a quarantine facility in an undisclosed location after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on a flight from Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, authorities said. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all of the animals were accounted for within about a day, though three were euthanized for undisclosed reasons.",

      "The plan was announced Friday by the government, Nvidia, and some of South Korea\u2019s biggest companies, including chipmakers Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and auto giant Hyundai Motor, after President Lee Jae Myung met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.",
      "At a news conference, Huang said he hopes to export Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI chips to China, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on loosening U.S. chip restrictions as the two leaders pledged to reduce trade tensions.",

      "About 50,000 of the GPUs will be used to support a government project to build a national cloud computing center for AI and Nvidia will provide the same number of GPUs each to Samsung and SK to help them enhance their manufacturing processes through AI and accelerate the development of advanced semiconductors.",
      "Hyundai and Nvidia said they plan to collaborate on developing technologies related to self-driving cars, smart factories and robotics, a process that will be powered by 50,000 of Nvidia\u2019s advanced Blackwell GPUs.",
      "Speaking to business leaders, Huang highlighted how AI and advanced computing are driving a profound transformation across industries, adding to the need for more infrastructure and capacity.

And so I\u2019m hopeful that both governments will arrive at a conclusion someday where Nvidia\u2019s technology could be exported to China.\u201d",
      "Huang acknowledged U.S. security concerns about Nvidia technology being used by China\u2019s military but argued that China already has ample AI capabilities, making the use of Nvidia chips for military purposes largely unnecessary.",
      "In August, Trump announced a deal with Nvidia and AMD, another chipmaker, to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns among national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.",

The milestone underscores the upheaval driven by the AI craze, widely seen as the biggest technological shift since Apple co-founder Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago.",

The tech executives clinked glasses, took bomb shots, and at one point, Huang stepped outside to hand baskets of chicken and fried cheese to the crowd waiting outside.",

      "WASHINGTON -- For a day, at least, beleaguered Democrats are hopeful again. But just beneath the party's relief at securing its first big electoral wins since last November\u2019s drubbing lay unresolved questions about its direction heading into next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "The Election Day romp of Republicans stretched from deep-blue New York and California to swing-states Georgia, Pennsylvania and Virginia. There were signs that key voting groups, including young people, Black voters and Hispanics who shifted toward President Donald Trump's Republican Party just a year ago, may be shifting back. And Democratic leaders across the political spectrum coalesced behind a simple message focused on Trump's failure to address rising costs and everyday kitchen table issues.",
      "The dominant performance sparked a new round of debate among the party\u2019s establishment-minded pragmatists and fiery progressives over which approach led to Tuesday\u2019s victories, and which path to take into the high-stakes 2026 midterm elections and beyond. The lessons Democrats learn from the victories will help determine the party\u2019s leading message and messengers next year \u2014 when elections will decide the balance of power in Congress for the second half of Trump's term \u2014 and potentially in the 2028 presidential race, which has already entered its earliest stages.",
      "\u201cOf course, there\u2019s a division within the Democratic Party. There\u2019s no secret,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders told reporters at a Capitol Hill press conference about the election results.",

Suzan Del Bene, who leads the House Democrats\u2019 midterm campaign strategy, avoided saying Mamdani\u2019s name when asked about his success.",
      "Del Bene instead cheered the moderate approach adopted by Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill in successful races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey as a more viable track for candidates outside of a Democratic stronghold like New York City.",

      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a likely Democratic presidential prospect who campaigned alongside Democrats in several states leading up to Tuesday\u2019s elections, noted the candidates hit on a common issue that resonated with voters, regardless of location.",
      "\u201cAll of these candidates who won in these different states were focused on peoples' everyday needs,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cAnd you saw voters in every one of those states and cities showing up to send a clear message to Donald Trump that they\u2019re rejecting his chaos.\u201d",
      "Amid Democrats\u2019 celebratory phone calls and news conferences, members of the party's different wings had some sharp critiques for each other.",
      "While Shapiro cheered the party\u2019s success during a Wednesday interview, he also acknowledged concerns about Mamdani in New York.",
      "Shapiro, one of the nation\u2019s most prominent Jewish elected leaders, said he\u2019s not comfortable with some of Mamdani\u2019s comments on Israel. The New York mayor-elect, a Muslim, has described Israel\u2019s response to the Oct. 7 attacks as \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Palestinian people and has been slow to condemn rhetoric linked to anti-Semitism.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve expressed that to him personally. We\u2019ve had good private communications,\u201d Shapiro said of his concerns. \u201cAnd I hope, as he did last night in his victory speech, that he\u2019ll be a mayor that protects all New Yorkers and tries to bring people together.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Sanders' political strategist, Faiz Shakir, warned Democrats against embracing \u201ccookie cutter campaigns that say nothing and do nothing\u201d \u2014 a reference to centrist Democrats Spanberger and Sherrill.",

      "Prosecutors told jurors that Sean Charles Dunn broke the law when he threw his submarine sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent on the night of Aug. 10.",
      "One of Dunn's lawyers urged the jury to acquit Dunn, a former Justice Department employee, of a misdemeanor assault charge after a two-day trial. Defense attorney Sabrina Shroff questioned why the case was brought in the first place.",

Stitt has granted clemency only once during his nearly seven years in office, to death row inmate Julius Jones in 2021. He has rejected clemency recommendations in four other cases. A total of 16 men have been executed during Stitt's time in office. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the board's decision.",

      "Wood's attorneys don't deny that he participated in the robbery but maintain that his brother, Zjaiton Wood, was the one who actually stabbed Wipf. Zjaiton Wood, who received a no-parole life sentence for Wipf's death and died in prison in 2019, admitted to several people that he killed Wipf, said Tremane Wood's attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves.",

      "The eight-person jury in Chicago, where Boeing used to have its headquarters, had been expected to set financial compensation amounts for the families of two women who were among the people who died when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 plunged to the ground in March 2019. But moments before jurors arrived in the courtroom for opening statements, U.S. District Judge Jorge Luis Alonso was notified that one of the cases had been settled out of court.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful,\u201d Fredrick Musau Ndivo, the father of Mercy Ndivo, a 28-year-old mother originally from Kenya, told the judge after his family reached a settlement with Boeing. \u201cWe wish you the best and wish the legal system of America to hold up the rights and justice for the people for all walks of life.\u201d",
      "The family's attorney, Robert Clifford, who is representing many of the victims' relatives, told the judge that two more pending cases also were settled recently. Boeing negotiated pre-trial settlements in most of the dozens of wrongful death lawsuits that were filed against the aircraft maker after the crash.",
      "Details of the settlements were confidential and not disclosed. Lawyers say less than a dozen lawsuits remain unresolved.",
      "The trial that proceeded Wednesday centered on the death of Shikha Garg, a United Nations consultant. A settlement in the case could still be reached at any stage of the trial.",
      "Like a number of the other passengers, Garg, a consultant for the United Nations Development Programme, was on her way to attend a U.N. environmental assembly in Nairobi, Kenya. She is survived by her husband and parents.",
      "In his opening statement to the jury, Shanin Specter, the family's lawyer, painted a picture of a young and accomplished woman. A citizen of India, Garg was also a newlywed.",
      "\u201cShe was a beautiful person inside and out,\u201d the lawyer said in his opening statement.",
      "Specter turned on a screen that showed a photo of a smiling Garg as a bride just months before she boarded the deadly Ethiopian Airlines flight, dressed in a sari and holding flower garlands in line with Indian tradition. The then-new Boeing Max crashed minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport.",
      "Specter called Garg\u2019s death \u201csenseless\u201d and \u201cpreventable,\u201d and he showed jurors a March 10, 2019, picture of what he described as an \u201cenormous crater\u201d left in the ground after the plane nosedived.",
      "\u201cMoney is an entirely inadequate substitute for the life of Shikha Garg,\" Specter said.",

But they will be asked to award damages and decide compensation for matters such as burial expenses, loss of income, and grief suffered by immediate family members.",
      "One contentious point is whether Garg suffered pain in her final moments before death.",

      "Since the crash had no survivors, Boeing\u2019s expert testimony would provide the best snapshot of passengers\u2019 experiences and support the company's claim that they didn\u2019t experience physical injury before impact, Webb said.",
      "\u201cThere would not have been time for them to feel any physical pain when they hit the ground,\u201d he said.",
      "From nearly the moment pilots flying for Ethiopian Airlines took off in their new Boeing jetliner, they encountered problems with the plane.",
      "A device called a stick shaker began vibrating the captain\u2019s control column, warning that the plane might stall and fall from the sky. For six minutes, the pilots were bombarded by alarms as they fought to fly the plane before entering a final nosedive at nearly 700 miles per hour.",
      "The trial arrives after years of litigation overshadowed by the aerospace giant\u2019s broader legal troubles.",
      "U.S. prosecutors charged Boeing with conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with both crashes, accusing the company of deceiving government regulators about a flight-control system it developed for the 737 Max. In both crashes, the software had pitched the nose of the planes down repeatedly based on faulty readings from a single sensor.",
      "The Justice Department has asked a federal judge in Texas to dismiss the felony charge and approve its pending agreement with Boeing. If the judge signs off, Boeing would avoid prosecution by paying or investing an additional $1.1 billion toward fines, compensation for victims\u2019 families, and internal safety and quality improvements.",

      "\"I just feel like AI \u2026 it's the new era that we're in. And I look at it as a tool, as an instrument, and utilize it,\" she added.",
      "Jones outlined her song making process, saying she scrolls through her list of poems to see which she wants to make a song about. She puts the lyrics into an AI music-generator app, then adds different prompts, like slow tempo R&B, female soulful vocals, light guitar and heavy drums \u2014 and then clicks create.",
      "AI artist lands multi-million dollar recording deal",
      "Jones' AI music success led to a multi-million dollar exclusive recording deal with Hallwood Media \u2013 and also some backlash from artists like Grammy-nominated Kehlani. Kehlani railed against the use of AI in creative spaces in a recent TikTok video, saying \"nobody will be able to justify AI to me\" and \"I don't respect it.\"",
      "But Jones says she doesn't let critics stop her from making art.",
      "\"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Technology's evolving. Everybody has different ways of putting in work to get to where they're at. I don't feel that way about it. I still love Kehlani's music. I still listen to her every day,\" she said.",
      "Hallwood Media also defended the artist and said Monet represents a new age of music.",
      "\"What Nikki has done with Xania Monet really represents the future of music. It shows that taste and instinct have always mattered more than technical dexterity, and we're now seeing that play out in real time. AI is breaking down barriers around age, image, and access, giving creators who might not have had a traditional path into the industry the chance to bring their stories and ideas to life while connecting directly with listeners. That kind of innovation is exactly what drives us at Hallwood,\" Danny Jacobson, the head of A&R at Hallwood Media, said in a statement to \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Addressing a concern some have that AI could allow people to make music from racial or cultural backgrounds they may not be a part of, Jones responded, \"That's what I'm here to let them know, I'm Telisha. I'm a part of your culture; I'm a Black woman; I'm a creator; I'm an entrepreneur; I created Xania,\" she said.",

      "The Ultimate Fighting Championship\u00a0mixed martial arts company has cut fighter Issac Dulgarian, days after his loss by first round submission to Yadier del Valle during Saturday's Fight Night prompted a probe of possible pre-bout irregular betting patterns.",
      "This makes the UFC the latest sports entity navigating a possible gambling-related integrity issue, joining Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, which recently saw FBI arrests connected to a gambling investigation.",
      "Suspicious gambling activity was reportedly flagged after the odds on Dulgarian, the favorite, changed rapidly in the hours leading up to the bout, leading several major sports betting sites to stop taking wagers on the contest due to the betting patterns.",
      "The UFC said in a statement Monday: \"Like many professional sports organizations, UFC works with an independent betting integrity service to monitor wagering activity on our events. Our betting integrity partner, IC360, monitors wagering on every UFC event and is conducting a thorough review of the facts surrounding the Dulgarian vs. del Valle bout on Saturday, November 1. We take these allegations very seriously, and along with the health and safety of our fighters, nothing is more important than the integrity of our sport.\"",
      "The controversy may have played out in the Octagon. Cageside commentators Daniel Cormier and Michael Chiesa called the submission \"white belt stuff\" on air, implying that sloppy actions led to the loss.",
      "The integrity of specific UFC bouts has faced scrutiny before, most notably for contests involving former UFC veteran and coach James Krause. He was investigated for allegedly using his background in mixed martial arts to offer insights to offshore sportsbooks and bettors. Krause was also suspended by the UFC for failing to disclose a fighter's pre-fight injury. He was never charged with any crimes.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The suit worn by Will Ferrell in the 2003 comedy hit \"Elf\" is going under the hammer at an auction of movie memorabilia in London this December, and the skin-tight green and yellow piece of Hollywood Christmas magic is expected to fetch over a quarter of a million dollars.",
      "Bidding for the iconic suit, complete with the conical hat and matching tunic, will begin at 50,000 pounds, the equivalent of about $65,000, but it's expected to eventually sell for as much as 200,000 pounds, or about $261,000, when the hammer falls at the Propstore Winter Entertainment Memorabilia auction.",
      "According to the description on the Propstore Auction house's website, there are tags reading \"Mr. Ferrell\" on the inside of the tunic and the stockings, with \"Hero-3\" also handwritten on the tunic tag.",
      "The auctioneers say the belt also has \"Mr. Ferrell\" written on it in blue ink.",
      "Large movie productions often create several versions of the same props, but the term \"hero\" is typically used to describe the highly detailed iterations which are central to the plot and intended for close-up shots in the final cut of the movie.",
      "The suit going up for sale does not appear to be the same one that Ferrell wore to an NHL hockey game in Los Angeles just after Christmas last year, when he gave fellow sports fans a giggle by sitting near the ice looking disgruntled with a beer and a cigarette in the garish outfit.",
      "Another notable item up for sale in the December auction is Marty McFly's iconic hoverboard from the second and third installations of the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, which is expected to sell for more than $156,000.",
      "According to the product description, it's the lightweight foam version of the prop, which actors used for scenes where their characters were seen carrying the boards, rather than a wooden version that Michael J. Fox and his fellow actors were seen riding in other parts of the movies.",
      "The example of the then-futuristic hoverboard does have some \"wear from use and age, including adhesive residue around the fastening strips, cracks in the foam, and paint chipping throughout,\" according to the auctioneers.",
      "The most valuable lot in the auction, however, will be the original prop used as Boba Fett's rifle in \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\"",
      "The auction house says it is the only known example of the prop. Other stunt versions and castings were made for later movies in the franchise, but, according to Propstore Auctions, this EE-3 carbine blaster has been \"identified by its serial number and photo-matched by details on the stock, directly confirming its provenance.\"",
      "The blaster, which started its life as a genuine 1917 Webley & Scott No.1 Mark I flare pistol, is expected to fetch the equivalent of around $915,000 when it goes under the hammer.",
      "The three day auction begins on Dec. 5 and will feature other iconic film memorabilia including Indiana Jones' fedora, worn by Harrison Ford in the 1984 \"Temple of Doom\" movie, Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightweight lightsaber from 1999's \"Phantom Menace,\" and Jack Nicholson's stunt axe from the horror classic \"The Shining.\"",

      "Diane Ladd, the actress known for her Oscar-nominated roles in \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" \"Wild at Heart\" and \"Rambling Rose,\" has died, her representative confirmed to CBS News on Monday. She was 89.",
      "Her daughter, Laura Dern, said in a statement that she was by Ladd's side when she passed at her home in Ojai, California.",
      "\"She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,\" Dern said. \"We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.\"",
      "Dern's statement didn't immediately cite a cause of death.",
      "In 2023, the mother and daughter told \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0that the two began taking daily walks in Santa Monica after learning that Ladd had developed a lung disease, believed to be caused by exposure to pesticides. Dern was told her mother only had six months to live.",
      "That's when the two had conversations that eventually filled the pages of \"Honey, Baby, Mine,\" their joint memoir named for an old folk song Ladd's father used to sing. They discussed everything, starting with Ladd's marriage and divorce from Laura's father, actor Bruce Dern, to her efforts to discourage Laura from joining the family business.",
      "\"She was only, like, 11 years old, and I said, 'Don't be an actress. Be a doctor, be a lawyer,'\" Ladd said. \"Nobody cares if you put on weight or your chin points when you cry if you're a doctor. They just want you to be the best you can be. But an actress? They care, care, care, care, care.\"",
      "But Dern said there was no stopping her from being in movies: \"No. It is all I knew.\"",
      "A native of Laurel, Mississippi, Ladd was apparently destined to stand out. In her 2006 memoir, \"Spiraling Through the School of Life,\" she remembered being told by her great-grandmother that she would one day be in \"front of a screen\" and would \"command\" her own audiences.",
      "By the mid-1970s, she had lived out her fate well enough to tell The New York Times that she no longer denied herself the right to call herself great.",
      "\"Now I don't say that,\" she said. \"I can do Shakespeare, Ibsen, English accents, Irish accents, no accent, stand on my head, tap dance, sing, look 17 or look 70.\"",
      "A gifted comic and dramatic performer, Ladd had a long career in television and on stage before breaking through as a film performer in Martin Scorsese's 1974 release \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.\" She earned an Oscar nomination for supporting actor for her turn as the acerbic, straight-talking Flo, and went on to appear in dozens of movies over the following decades.",
      "Her many credits included \"Chinatown,\" \"Primary Colors\" and two other movies for which she received best supporting nods, \"Wild at Heart\" and \"Rambling Rose,\" both of which co-starred her daughter. She also continued to work in television, with appearances in \"ER,\" \"Touched by an Angel\" and \"Alice,\" the spinoff from \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" among others.",
      "Through marriage and blood relations, Ladd was tied to the arts. Tennessee Williams was a second cousin, and first husband Bruce Dern, Laura's father, was himself an Academy Award nominee. Ladd and Laura Dern achieved the rare feat of mother-and-daughter nominees for their work in \"Rambling Rose.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 08:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The former Prince Andrew is set to lose his final military title, as King Charles continues shunning his younger brother over historic ties to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, appears set to be stripped of his last honorary military title as the British royals continue their efforts to distance themselves from King Charles III's younger brother over his links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"We've seen Andrew surrender the military positions that he's had and we're looking now at the one remaining position he has, which is the honorary vice admiral position, and we've got a process underway for that\" to be removed, Defense Secretary John Healey told Britain's Sky News on Sunday.",
      "In a separate interview on the same subject with CBS News' partner network BBC News, the defense chief said \"it's a move the king has indicated we should take.\"",
      "Mountbatten Windsor is the late Queen Elizabeth II's third child. He spent decades in public life as a working member of the royal family, but revelations of his historical ties to Epstein have turned him into a pariah figure. In 2016, he was named in a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Epstein paid her to have sex with the former prince on several occasions. Mountbatten Windsor has repeatedly denied the claims, but he settled the case out of court with Giuffre in 2022, for an undisclosed sum.",
      "That settlement failed to stanch criticism of the former prince and the resulting pressure on the royal family, however, as new information continued to emerge about his historic connections with Epstein in the wake of a damning 2019 interview\u00a0with the BBC's Newsnight, in which he defended his ties to the disgraced financier.",
      "In the years after that interview, right up until this year, amid revelations about correspondence between Epstein and the then-prince, the royal family appeared reluctant to intervene, allowing him to step away from public duties and to give up many of his titles and privileges of his own volition.",
      "Last week, however, in a landmark move, King Charles announced that his younger brother would be deprived of the title of prince and told to leave his 30-room, tax-payer-funded Royal Lodge home in Windsor.",
      "One of the few titles Andrew Mountbatten Windsor still holds is honorary Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy, which he received on his 55th birthday in 2015. It is unclear how long the process to remove that title, which defense chief Healy has now confirmed is underway, might take.",
      "The former prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, including serving as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, and commanding the anti-mine vessel HMS Cottesmore.",
      "Asked about the ongoing scandal, President Trump told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes that \"it's a terrible thing that's happened\" to the royal family.",
      "\"That's been a tragic situation,\" he said. \"And, I mean, I feel badly for the family.\"",
      "CBS News has contacted the royal family for comment on the pending removal of the former prince's Royal Naval title.",

    "summary": "In his latest film, George Clooney plays a familiar role \u2013 one of the world's biggest movie stars \u2013 who nonetheless tries to reconcile professional success and his personal shortcomings.",
    "story": [
      "Venice can feel like a movie set, particularly when riding on a boat down the Grand Canal with George Clooney.",
      "Waving to fans, he's asked if that ever gets normal. \"No,\" he replied.",
      "Clooney has practice navigating this kind of attention. He's made about 50 films, picking up a couple of Academy Awards along the way (as an actor for \"Syriana,\" and as a producer for \"Argo\"). And for his latest, \"Jay Kelly,\" he plays one of the world's biggest movie stars \u2013 a familiar role.",
      "He says it's true that he said yes to the film within 24 hours. \"Well, I read it, and I was like, Well, if I take time to think of it, they might go get Brad. And I can't have that. I can't have that, man! When you read something, you know.\"",
      "Co-starring Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, the Netflix film \u2013 part comedy, part drama \u2013 critiques the cult of celebrity, as Clooney's character embarks on a journey to reconcile his professional success and personal failings.",
      "I asked, \"There's this kind of mind-bending experience where you're watching the film and you're wondering how much is the character and how much is George Clooney. Did you feel that making it?\"",
      "\"I really didn't,\" Clooney said. \"You know, what I know in life is you can live with failure. I tried this, it didn't work out. What you can't live with is regret. Jay Kelly is filled with regret. I mean, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I have no regrets. I've certainly made mistakes. I've certainly done some dumb things. But I took a big bite at the apple, and I really took big swings.\"",
      "\"Were there things that felt autobiographical?\"",
      "\"I mean, there's things that we would laugh about, you know, playing a guy who no one says 'no' to.\"",
      "\"And that's the case for you?\"",
      "\"Well, I designed it so that that's not the case.\"",
      "How? \"I pay people!\" he laughed. \"No, I designed it by surrounding myself with the same friends that I met when I was 20 years old \u2026 I talk to them every day.\"",
      "\"Do you go out of your way to understand that there is this perceived gap between you and others?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Clooney said. \"I didn't grow up around fame. I mean, my father was a newscaster in Cincinnati, Ohio. My aunt [Rosemary Clooney] was a famous singer, but I'd met her three times. So, when I met someone famous, I was always like, Oh my God! And so, I always try to remind people that, honest to God, this is the job that I do and that, you know, we're all fairly normal.\"",
      "\"Why is that so important to you?\" I asked.",
      "\"I think because I was raised not only that you treat everyone equally, but that everyone treats you equally as well.\"",
      "Clooney is pretty disarming, as we saw while setting up the interview. Asked if he wanted to check how he looked in the camera, he smiled: \"No, I don't care. I'm too old to give a s*** anymore.\"",
      "\"You are, for many, kind of the poster man of aging gracefully.\"",
      "\"That's why I'm wearing these glasses,\" Clooney said, \"because for the record, I have a horrible sinus infection. If I take these off ...\" He demonstrated for us. \"You see the problem?\"",
      "\"How much does aging factor in \u2026 Do you see parts changing?\"",
      "\"I see parts on my body changing,\" he replied. \"I'm like, that fell off? How'd that fall off?\"",
      "\"I didn't mean that.\"",
      "\"Oh sure, parts have changed significantly.\"",
      "He's 64 now, married to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin. The two juggle Hollywood glamour with social justice work through their foundation. They have eight-year-old twins, and the actor (once famously single) says family life suits him \u2013 another thing that sets him apart from this character. \"Fame, [Jay] actually does really well. And I'm kind of the opposite of that in a way.\"",
      "What do you mean? \"I feel I'm a better parent, I hope, certainly husband. And fame, if there was one of the two, that would be the one I'm least comfortable with.\"",
      "\"Wow, you seem to be quite comfortable with fame and celebrity,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, you know, you got to put on your famous outfit when you come here to do a film premiere.\"",
      "\"But you know everywhere you go, people watch you. Is it performative?\"",
      "\"Sometimes it's performative,\" Clooney replied. \"I mean, listen, you don't get caught picking your nose, you know? You have to be more aware than other people would be.\"",
      "I asked, \"You seem to have this desire to keep some things for yourself, but then you can also be very political and really stick yourself out there.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, yeah,\" Clooney said. \"I try to do it when I think I have a responsibility to it. My father always told me to challenge people with more power than you, and protect people with less power. One of the things you understand is, you can't take on every fight. You have to pick things. I worked on trying to help solve some of the problems in Darfur in the early 2000s. Failed. You fail more often than you succeed. But it doesn't mean you don't keep trying. We still work there, we're still involved.\"",
      "He also does not regret writing that opinion piece in The New York Times, urging President Biden to drop out. \"To not do it would be to say I'm not going to tell the truth,\" he said.",
      "While Clooney does not shy from public activism, he gets some help guarding his private life at the family's place in Italy: \"Italian towns adopt you, Like, people come up and say, 'Which house is George Clooney's?' They go, 'Hey, he doesn't live here, he doesn't.' They protect you.\"",
      "Right now, Clooney considers France home. \"We live on a 750-acre farm, and our kids run around. We wanted them to have something of a normal existence.\"",
      "\"And you find that on a 750-acre ranch?\"",
      "\"Well, you find it on a farm, and you find on a very small school and very sort of farming community. We found a real peace there.\"",
      "He prizes that peace. In the film, Jay Kelly is searching for what George Clooney already has: a sense of self and balance. Clooney really does seem to have it all.",
      "I said, \"If people say, What was it like being with George Clooney? One of the things I'm going to say is, well, I was sitting here sweating, and somehow he didn't seem to sweat.\"",
      "\"I don't sweat!\" Clooney laughed. \"It's a funny thing. I don't sweat much when I'm on camera, funnily enough. I don't know why. I put ice cubes under my arms!\"",
      "But like the rest of us, he still has to contend with the passing of time. \"I want to work, but I don't want to fill my life with work,\" he said. \"When I turned 60, Amal and I talked about it, and I said, 'Look, I can still play basketball with the boys, I can still hang out. But in 25 years I'll be 85. And that's a real number.'",
      "\"And things change, and it doesn't matter how many granola bars you eat; it catches you. So, we have to focus on making sure we work. We also have to have focus on spending time with the people we love. More time, because at the end of your life, you don't go, I wish I'd worked more.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:37:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The author talks about his first fiction published since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him; his own immigrant experience in the U.S.; and what happens when freedom of speech dies.",
    "story": [
      "Salman Rushdie recently turned up at a McNally Johnson bookstore near South Street Seaport in Manhattan. \"It's actually not particularly close to where I live, but I come here a lot,\" he said.",
      "He was browsing for his own books. His newest one, \"The Eleventh Hour,\" is his 23rd \u2013 a collection of short stories and novellas.",
      "Life has changed since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him. \"I think what has changed is, for public-facing things, then there has to be security in a way that there wasn't for 20 years,\" he said.",
      "On August 12, 2022, Rushdie was on stage in Chautauqua, N.Y., ready to speak, ironically about America as a safe haven for writers. A man lunged at him with a knife.",
      "His account of the attack, \"Knife,\" was published in 2024: \"I raise my left hand in self-defense. He plunges the knife into it. ... After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere. I feel my legs give way, and I fall.\"",
      "Rushdie lost the sight in his right eye. \"I can still read,\" he said, \"but I do find that I use iPads in a way that I never used to. Because there's light, and because I can adjust the size of the type. So, I never, ever, read a book on an iPad, but now I do.\"",
      "His left hand and liver were badly damaged, but he lived, which he considers \"a miracle.\"",
      "In May of this year, Rushdie's attacker, Lebanese-American Hadi Matar, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prosecutors argued he was acting on the fatwa, the 1989 order by Iran's leader, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, to kill the author, claiming passages in his fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" insulted Islam.",
      "Recognized just for his fiction before, suddenly Rushdie was world famous (to some, infamous) for the fatwa. After nearly a decade in hiding, protected 24/7 by British security, Rushdie emerged and moved to New York, thinking times had changed. But he was wrong.",
      "Yet the author does not seem bitter or angry. \"I think that's who I am,\" he said.",
      "I suggested, \"Most people would say, well, this is a clear recipe for a life with PTSD.\"",
      "\"Well, I do have a therapist,\" Rushdie said, \"and I asked him at one point to list for me the symptoms of PTSD. And I said, 'But I don't seem to be having those symptoms, so what's wrong with me?' And he said, 'Well, it's because you're a bad-ass, that's the technical term.'\"",
      "The new book is the first fiction he's published since the attack.",
      "So, why \"The Eleventh Hour\"? \"Well, for a start, I'm 78,\" he said. \"For another thing, I had a fairly intimate encounter with death, you know, and got away with it. But it makes you think, you know? So, I thought this idea of running out of time was something I had on the brain.\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America\"",
      "\"Now you have entered the magic space of my childhood,\" the fictional narrator of one story says, as he takes a last walk up the hill to the neighborhood where the real Salman Rushdie grew up, in Mumbai, India (which he still calls Bombay). \"My relationship with the place is kind of elegiac now,\" Rushdie said. It's a relationship about something that has passed.",
      "He left India for an English boarding school at the age of 13. He left Britain after nearly 40 years there. He became an American citizen in 2016. Rushdie sees his place in the world through the eye of an immigrant.",
      "Asked what he felt after becoming a U.S. citizen, Rushdie said, \"I remember getting into a cab, leaving the office where I'd been sworn in, and being driven back through the streets of the city, and it felt different. I thought, Oh, I can belong. And it felt very good.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did the feeling that you had when you were sworn in as a citizen become fractured or altered based on what's happened since, both in public life in the United States, and to you?\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America, but it's a hard time all over,\" he replied. \"If you think of countries as people, there is their better self and their less-good self. And it would be nice if this country were to remember its better self.\"",
      "\"The Eleventh Hour\" includes a ghost story, characters who get even, a writer who disappears. But the book is also political. He writes: \"Words such as good and bad or right and wrong are losing their effect, emptying of meaning, and failing anymore to shape society.\"",
      "The meaning of words matters to Rushdie, who has spent his entire career advocating for free speech, even though exercising it nearly got him killed.",
      "He said, \"The final story in the collection, 'The Old Man in the Piazza,' is kind of an allegory of that. In fact, free speech, to my great surprise, language itself, turned into a character, a female character. She just walked into the story and sat down in a corner, and I hadn't expected her at all.\"",
      "\"She is in fact a very old language, one of the oldest and richest\u2026\" he writes, in a story about what happens when speech is restricted. \"It's even possible, though it's hard for her to admit this, even to herself, that she may die. Nobody's listening. Nobody cares.\"",
      "Language abandons her corner, leaving people no longer able to speak:\u00a0\"We are at a loss to know how things will proceed. Our words fail us.\"",
      "\"That's pretty startling and scary,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Rushdie agreed. \"It's supposed to be.\"",

      "From \"In the South\"",
      "The day Junior fell down began like any other day: the explosion of heat rippling the air, the trumpeting sun\u00adlight, the traffic's tidal surges, the prayer chants in the distance, the cheap film music rising up from the floor below, the pelvic thrusts of an \"item number\" dancing across a neigh\u00adbor's TV; a child's cry, a mother's rebuke, unexplained laughter, scarlet expectorations, bicycles, the newly plaited hair of school\u00adgirls, the smell of strong coffee, a green wing flashing in a tree. Senior and Junior, two very old men, opened their eyes in their bedrooms on the fourth floor of a sea-green building on a leafy lane, just out of sight of Elliot's Beach, where, that evening, the young would congregate, as they always did, to perform the rites of youth, not far from the village of the fisherfolk, who had no time for such frivolity. The poor were puritans by night and day. As for the old, they had rites of their own and did not need to wait for evening. With the sun stabbing at them through their window blinds, the two old men struggled to their feet and lurched out onto their adjacent verandas, emerging at the same moment, like characters in an ancient tale, trapped in fateful coincidences, unable to escape the consequences of chance.",
      "Almost at once they began to speak. Their words were not new. These were ritual speeches, obeisances to the new day, of\u00adfered in call-and-response format, like the rhythmic dialogues or \"duels\" of the virtuosi of Carnatic music during the annual December festival.",
      "\"Be thankful we are men of the south,\" said Junior, stretch\u00ading and yawning. \"Southerners are we, in the south of our city in the south of our country in the south of our continent. God be praised. We are warm, slow, and sensual guys, not like the cold fishes of the north.\"",
      "Senior, scratching first his belly and then the back of his neck, contradicted him at once. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"the south is a fiction, existing only because men have agreed to call it that. Suppose men had imagined the earth the other way up! We would be the northerners then. The universe does not under\u00adstand up and down; neither does a dog. To a dog there is no north and south. And in the second place, you're not that warm a character, and a woman would laugh to hear you call yourself sensual\u2014but you are slow, that is beyond a doubt.\"",
      "This was how they were: they fought, going at each other like ancient wrestlers whose left feet were tied together at the ankles. The rope that bound them so tightly was their name. By a curious chance\u2014which they had come to think of as \"des\u00adtiny,\" or, as they more often called it, a \"curse\"\u2014they shared a name, a long name like so many names of the south, a name neither of them cared to speak. By banishing the name, by re\u00adducing it to its initial letter, V., they made the rope invisible, which did not mean it did not exist. They echoed each other in other ways\u2014their voices were high, they were of similarly wiry build and medium height, they were both nearsighted, and, after lifetimes of priding themselves on the quality of their teeth, they had both surrendered to the humiliating inevitabil\u00adity of dentures\u2014but it was the unused name, that symmetrical V., the Name That Could Not Be Spoken, that had joined them together for decades.",
      "The two old men did not share a birthday, however. One was seventeen days older than the other. That must have been how \"Senior\" and \"Junior\" got started, even though the nicknames had been in use for so long that nobody could now remember who originally thought them up. V. Senior and Junior they had become, Junior V. and Senior V. forevermore, quarreling to the death. They were eighty-one years old. If old age was thought of as an evening, ending in midnight oblivion, they were well into the eleventh hour.",
      "\"You look terrible,\" Junior told Senior, as he did every morn\u00ading. \"You look like a man who is only waiting to die.\"",
      "Senior\u2014nodding gravely, and also speaking in accordance with their private tradition\u2014responded, \"That is better than looking, as you do, like a man who is still waiting to live.\"",

      "K\u014cRERO: THE PAST IS THE FUTURE",
      "I'd opened my share of graves before finding something of value: a pendant in the shape of a fishhook, carved from greenstone. Greenstone only came from Aotearoa, the land our people had fled before we ended up on this island. The pendant, when held to the sun, glowed soft and green as dawn through miro trees. I was of the third generation born on this island, but the pendant was from our ancestors, from before. My father said a fishhook necklace had a special meaning: it ensured seafarers safe passage over water. To wear the pendant, I braided a cord from the inner bark of a hibiscus branch, which produced a fiber so strong, even parrots couldn't bite through it.",
      "Unpleasant as it was, and offensive to our ancestors, I was ready to open more graves.",
      "Still, I had other duties to perform. I was up each morning before dawn to hunt birds. Pigeons in planting season, t\u016b\u012b birds when the flax blossomed. This time of year, it was parrots. They arrived on our island in closely bonded flocks, and it was these social connections we'd exploit to ensnare them. When our ancestors landed on this island, it was so full of birds, they named it Manumotu, or Bird Island. If only that were still the case. These days, we'd quietly crouch all morning, ready to trigger our snares, in the hopes of catching a bird or two. The worst part was the silence. I'm the talkative type. My mother says I was born speaking, which is why she named me K\u014drero. Only after hours of silent birding was I free to open graves with my best friend Hine. The two of us could talk all day.",
      "Hine's duties, unlike mine, were endless. She'd been but a girl when her mother died and she was given to an older, childless woman named Tiri. But after a few years, when Tiri went blind, it was Hine who became the caretaker. Tiri was one of the most amazing persons in the world \u2014 I admit I only knew eighty-four people \u2014 but Hine, like me, was sixteen years old, and nobody likes it when they have to do something. And Hine had to do everything for Tiri.",
      "After birding on the morning this story begins, I arrived at our island's cove to continue digging. Many people trapped on this island before us were buried around the cove. This was considered a good resting place because of the view and the breeze and because this was where birds landed after open-water voyages. Where'd the birds come from? I always wondered. Where'd they fly off to?",
      "I tethered my parrots to a branch. One was named Aroha \u2014 it was she who lured the wild parrots into our traps. I'd tug on Aroha's tether, she'd squawk in distress, and wild parrots would come to her aid.",
      "\"I ohiti r\u0101,\" I said to Aroha. \"I ohiti p\u014d.\"",
      "This was a fisherman's adage, shortened to fit a bird's memory. Alert by day, the saying went. Alert by night. My father was a fisherman.",
      "I knew from old stories that parrots could be made to talk, though I'd had no luck at it.",
      "The other parrot was freshly caught. We'd named her Kanokano \u2014 the complications she caused are soon to be described.",
      "With only a digging stick and a basket, I picked a likely spot on the upper beach and began moving sand. If only our ancestors had thought to mark their graves. But I suppose they didn't imagine being exhumed by their great-granddaughters. I ran into a lot of mangrove roots, which I hacked with the jagged edge of a mussel shell. By the time Hine and Tiri arrived, I was sweating.",
      "\"What's the ocean like today?\" Tiri asked. Her pearled-over gaze was directed at nothing.",
      "Hine rolled her eyes and helped the old woman onto a mat before handing her her weaving.",
      "\"It's blue, it's wet,\" Hine said impatiently. \"The waves go up and down.\" I described for Tiri how late-morning light penetrated the cove, illuminating the humps of mullet, how the distant reef-break frothed like coconut pulp, how sputtering waves reached up the beach before fingering all the little shells in retreat.",
      "Hine half-heartedly stabbed at some sand with her stick.",
      "I asked, \"Did you hear the Toki brothers found an earring in a grave?\" I was arm-deep in the hole, fighting roots.",
      "\"The Toki brothers are insufferable,\" Hine said. She made a gesture to help me, but looking in the hole saw I was already to the point where smelly water was seeping in.",
      "\"The earring was greenstone,\" I said. \"From the old world. I bet one of the brothers brings it to you. Will it be the big, handsome, doltish one? Or the big, handsome, inane one?\"",
      "\"Don't make fun of me,\" Hine said. \"You'll have to marry the one I reject. And have his baby.\"",
      "The Toki brothers were slow-witted, trusting, and humorless. But their father was charismatic and funny, and the truth was, Hine had a parent-crush on him. It was quite possible that when the marriage ban was lifted, she'd marry a Toki brother just to become the daughter of Papa Toki.",
      "Tiri took a breath. She always did that before beginning a story. While Hine had no patience for the old tales, I could hear them all day. Today was the story of Paikea, who was one of the navigators who discovered Aotearoa. He was from a place called Hawaiki. Tiri didn't start in the obvious places, like Paikea's departure from Hawaiki or his arrival at Aotearoa. She didn't start with Paikea sinking a canoe and drowning his seventy enemies. Nor with him being saved by a whale. Instead, she started that epic tale with a little moment: Paikea, succumbing both to vanity and shame, as he groomed his hair with a forbidden comb.",
      "All the while, Tiri did her weaving \u2014 her fingers displaying their own kind of sight.",
      "My hole reached the point where sand fell in as fast as I scooped it out. Hine scrunched her nose. It's probably clear that Hine's heart really wasn't into digging up graves. She could barely bring herself to touch any bones, and when she did, she was afraid they might belong to her mother, even though we knew her mother was buried up the hill, above the k\u016bmara fields. We'd both been there when she was put in the ground. Still, one person's bones can look like another's, which can look like anybody's, which might as well be your mother's. I hoped Hine would change her outlook when she finally found something of value in a grave.",
      "That's when my digging stick made the unmistakable knock of wood striking bone.",
      "Tiri paused her story. I reached into the dark water and felt something in the muck. Hine winced, afraid of what I'd pull out. \"I'm sorry, ancestor,\" I said. Then, with a sucking sound, I tugged out a dog skull. I reached back for its jaw, but the mud offered only bird bones and broken shells.",
      "\"Another junk pit,\" Hine said, and started pushing sand back into the hole.",
      "I contemplated the skull. Since we'd begun digging up the dead, I'd come across many dog remains. Did they happen to die at the same time as our ancestors? Were they slain and buried alongside? Or was it something else altogether? No living person on the island had ever seen a dog, and before we started digging, it was thought that dogs had never even been here.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked.",
      "\"Another dog skull,\" Hine said. \"Look at those teeth. Who'd want to get close to one of those things, let alone share the afterlife with it?\"",
      "\"Dogs had white fur, soft as t\u016b\u012b feathers,\" Tiri said. \"The old stories say they'd lick your face.\"",
      "\"They supposedly had long tongues,\" I said, marveling at the skull. Hine shook her head. \"You don't believe every story you hear, do you?\" Hine knew that I did, indeed, believe every story I heard.",
      "\"There's only one thing we know for sure about dogs,\" Hine said. \"They must've tasted good.\"",
      "What interested me was the size of a dog's eye sockets. K\u0101k\u0101 parrots also had large eyes. In fact, the eyes of a parrot were quite intelligent and expressive. \"Ancestors are supposed to be wise,\" I said. \"But they didn't leave us a single dog.\"",
      "Hine eyed its fangs. \"I'm glad they're gone.\"",
      "\"Parrots have sharp beaks,\" I said. \"And they're friendly.\" Hine took the skull and threw it.",
      "\"One of these days, you'll lose a finger to those birds,\" she said.",
      "Already, I've forgotten some stuff. That's how bad a storyteller I am. I should've mentioned that I was absolutely forbidden from teaching my parrots human words, that Hine had a father who was alive and walking around our island \u2014 we just didn't know his identity. That Papa Toki had lost an arm, with my mother and Tiri being the ones who cut it off.",
      "But it's too late, the story's begun. Aroha looked toward the cove, spread her wings, and began screeching. We turned. Drifting in past the reef was the largest waka canoe imaginable. It had two hulls and rocked silently with the waves. Most canoes in the old stories were waka taua, war canoes. This one seemed empty \u2014 not a person or a paddle or a sail was visible. We beheld its pitched bows and soaring mast. Most ominously, the symbol of a death-bringing frigate bird was carved down its side. Then we heard it: upon the spar was a large parrot with a crimson body. It had spread its wings and was screeching back.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked. \"What's going on?\"",
      "\"We have visitors,\" Hine said. She took my hand in hers, and then she screamed.",
      "It seemed to me that, at the sound of Hine's voice, dozens of warriors would sit up in the waka and reveal themselves. I took hold of my fishhook necklace because, like the waka before me, it felt both ancient and startlingly new.",
      "Did I mention that in all our years on the island, we'd never had a visitor? As Hine's scream echoed off the cliffs, the hum of island life stopped.",
      "Silenced were the sounds of flax being beaten on the leeward shore and of our fathers excavating burial sites on the south-facing bluffs.",
      "Our fathers \u2014 all the men of Bird Island \u2014 would be here in no time.",
      "I should say the waka wasn't a total surprise. We knew something was coming. There'd been signs.",

      "Dear Reader,",
      "You are eighteen years old. Cast out by your father, shunned by society, you have fled to Geneva with your lover and your sister. The closeness of their relationship makes you furious, but if you protest, your lover will abandon you. Confined by terrible storms, you find yourself in a house with your lover, your sister and Lord Byron, an infamous and magnetically attractive poet. You know he is dangerous, but you find yourself drawn to him. When he sets a challenge to write a ghost story, all the turmoil that has boiled within you finds a voice.",
      "The anger pours from your pen in a roar of rage. Even as the monster that emerges terrifies you, you understand that it belongs to you. This creature that crawls across the page is the woman you were always meant to be. And in Byron, this furious beast that you have kept hidden for so long may have found a mate. You are eighteen years old. The creature you have created will howl its way onto page and stage and screen, burning its path across history in its desire to be seen, to be known, to be loved. The monster will never be silenced. Neither will you.",
      "Prologue",
      "Geneva, 1816",
      "At dusk, the sky over Lake Geneva is the colour of blood in a glass of water. The ash fragments falling over the city form a strange fog \u2013 a thickening of the air, which swirls through the deserted streets, past the spire of the old cathedral and over the walls of the new Protestant church. Inside, people are on their knees, praying for the uncanny cloud to lift. It is a judgement, they fear, a punishment from God, or else a curse.",
      "This night, like so many before it, the choking dust has driven the residents of the city into the shelter of shuttered houses and places of prayer. Outside, there is no one to witness the way the ash gleams as it settles on the lake. The water flickers and shimmers, each tiny filament glowing like a candle, sinking into the silence, quickly snuffed out.",
      "The lake is chill and dark and deep \u2013 not even the fishermen have fathomed its depths, or the small children who, on any other evening, would be taking turns to dive beneath the surface, competing to see who could swim down the furthest, stay under the longest.",
      "No one is standing on the lake's stony shores to watch the water's surface glow, red as the strange sky above. No one is there to see the darkness beneath the water shift and stir and coalesce, parting for a breath, like two slick thighs, which fall back into the darkness with a gasp that is almost human.",
      "Above, half masked by cloud, a thin slash of moon hangs hazy and indifferent. A lone figure stumbles down to the lake and scrambles into a small rowboat that one of the fishermen has left bobbing at the end of a long line. Looking right, then left, the man leans forward over the rope. Flash of steel from the blade in his hand. A quick tug and the boat is free. The man settles himself on the rocking boards, tugging the oars. No one will see him on this cloud-deadened, mist-muffled night. No one will stop him. Still, his breath stutters and stumbles. He must be quick. His hands ache, his chest burns. His eyes feel gritty as the mist parts before him, then closes around him, giving him the strange sensation of being swallowed.",

      "The source of the Salmonella was traced to a single lot of organic moringa leaf powder imported from Vallon Farm Direct in Jodhpur, India, according to an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration.

      "The CDC said it may add other Vallon Farm products with moringa leaf powder to avoid as the agency's investigation continues.",

      "Starbucks Workers United announced Wednesday that its members voted to authorize a strike as they push to secure a first contract that offers them better pay and more flexible hours. Thousands of union members weighed in, with an overwhelming majority \u2014 92% \u2014 voting in favor of the strike, according to the labor group.",
      "The union said if Starbucks doesn't deliver a contract in the next week, the strike would begin the same day as Starbucks' Red Cup Day, an annual event intended to drum up business for the coffee giant's holiday menu.",
      "The strike would start at coffee shops in 25 U.S. cities, with additional stores later joining in if no progress is made, according to a spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United.",
      "\"The ball is in Starbucks' court,\" Michelle Eisen, a union spokesperson and barista at Starbucks, said in a statement.",
      "If the strike happens this month, it would mark the union's third national work stoppage in the past year. Workers United last protested in May over Starbucks' new dress code, and thousands also walked off the job in December 2024.",
      "Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News the company is disappointed that the union voted to authorize a strike instead of coming to the bargaining table.",
      "\"When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Negotiations at a standstill",
      "Starbucks Workers United, which\u00a0started in upstate New York in 2021, has grown to represent more than 9,500 baristas across 550 Starbucks cafes, still a relatively small percentage of total Starbucks workers. Overall, the company has more than 200,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but have bogged down. The union is asking for increased hours for workers and higher take-home pay, among other demands.",
      "According to Anderson, the union has proposed an immediate pay increase of 65%, and 77% total over three years. The union spokesperson disputed that claim, saying the union had presented several separate wage proposals during negotiations, which Starbucks then combined as if they were a single request.",
      "The union has also asked for added pay if they work a shift within three hours of opening or closing, during a promotional event, or over the weekend, Anderson said.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0recently told CBS News that he's open to talking with union members, but said that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 16:22:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A trend that started in the technology sector is spreading to other industries, with businesses cutting workers even as their profits expand.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year \u2014 the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy.",
      "The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a \"jobless boom.\" Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs.",
      "\"We've never seen anything like that\"",
      "\"This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook,\" Zhao told CBS News. \"It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well.\"",
      "At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted.",
      "\"You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine \u2014 profits are doing great,\" he said. \"We've never seen anything like that.\"",
      "For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as\u00a0\"no hire, no fire,\"\u00a0meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers.",
      "The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP.",
      "By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring.",
      "\"Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. \"While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP.\"",
      "Why unemployment isn't spiking",
      "The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available.",
      "Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said.",
      "\"You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too,\" he said. \"So that creates a very odd equilibrium.\"",
      "Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Pappas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies.",
      "Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Pappas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword.",
      "\"These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up \u2014 it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs,\" he noted.",
      "But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Pappas said.",
      "\"People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'\" he said. \"I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'.\"",

    "story": [
      "To understand how Americans are faring economically these days, it's helpful to consider the eleventh letter of the alphabet.",
      "Experts describe the current U.S. economy as \"K-shaped,\" a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder. The upward-slanting stroke of the \"K\" represents the ongoing trend of strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans.",
      "By contrast, the letter's lower-slanting stroke points to the multiple financial strains facing low- and middle-income people, from stubborn inflation and prohibitively expensive homes to surging credit card debt and high health insurance costs.",
      "This bifurcation of the economy isn't a new phenomenon, with inequality on the rise since the 1980s, noted Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics. But the divide in income and wealth has grown more skewed since the pandemic, reflecting the \"growing gap between the wealthy and the well-to-do and everyone else,\" he said. \"It's taken off.\"",
      "Several trends help explain what's behind the emergence of a K-shaped economy.",
      "Consumer spending",
      "Consumer spending \u2014 which drives over two-thirds of economic activity \u2014 is growing overall in the U.S. These days, however, a large and growing share of that commercial activity is driven by upwardly mobile Americans. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for almost half of all spending, according to an\u00a0analysis of Federal Reserve data by Zandi.",
      "\"That group has always accounted for a much larger share of spending, but that share has risen significantly over time, and now is the highest it's ever been in the data,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Other data tells a similar tale. In September, spending by lower-income households grew 0.6% from a year ago, compared with 2.6% for higher-income consumers, according to a recent\u00a0report from the Bank of America Institute.",
      "Spending on U.S. luxury fashion was also up 8% year-over-year in October, according to the bank's data \u2014 another sign that wealthier households are driving spending.",
      "\"Younger, less affluent households are facing ongoing challenges, while older, wealthier consumers are driving overall spending growth,\" said Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics.",
      "Record stock prices",
      "Because much of their income is held in stock and other securities, affluent Americans have particularly benefited from this year's run-up in financial markets, which have notched record after record largely on the strength of investor excitement about artificial intelligence.",
      "A May Gallup\u00a0poll found that 87% of Americans who own stock live in households with incomes of $100,000 or more. The top 1% of income earners \u2014 who on average earn around $731,000 per year, according to personal finance site SmartAsset \u2014 own nearly half of corporate securities and mutual funds, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "A bullish stock market also benefits the millions of employees with 401(k), mutual funds and other investments, but does much less to lift the many Americans without such holdings, said Tuan Nguyen, an economist at RSM US, an audit, tax and consulting firm.",
      "\"For lower- and middle-income people, especially the ones that live paycheck to paycheck, the rally in the equity markets might not be relatable to them because they are facing higher inflation and lower wage growth,\" he said.",
      "Of late, better-heeled Americans have also seen stronger pay gains. According to the Bank of America Institute, the rate of wage growth for higher-income households in September rose to 4% year-over-year. Annualized pay growth for lower-income households as of August fell to 0.9%, the lowest since the financial giant started tracking the data in 2016, said Taylor Bowley, an economist at the Bank of America Institute.",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500 workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency may need to close \"certain parts\" of the nation's airspace if the shutdown drags on.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation may need to close \"certain parts of the airspace\" if the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on record continues into next week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" Duffy said at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",
      "He added, \"We will restrict the airspace when we feel it's not safe.\"",
      "Throughout the 35-day federal shutdown, set to become the longest in U.S. history, Duffy has maintained that commercial air travel remains safe. The tradeoff is that passengers are experiencing more flight delays as officials slow flight traffic based on staffing levels to ensure that the national airspace remains well-monitored, Duffy\u00a0has said at earlier press conferences.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while an additional 4,700 trips were delayed on Monday, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "Duffy said on social media on Wednesday that 46% of the previous day's flight delays were due to staffing issues in air traffic control towers. Ordinarily, personnel issues account for roughly 5% of such delays, according to aviation data.",
      "\"Draconian steps\"?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights following the\u00a09/11 terror attacks for national security reasons, while hurricanes and other weather emergencies can also lead to flight restrictions. But closing parts of the nation's airspace because of staffing issues would be unprecedented, according to aviation industry experts.",
      "\"In this particular instance, Duffy is talking about staffing. He knows the strain and stress this is taking on air traffic controllers,\" Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and an expert on aviation security, told CBS News.",
      "Closing even a portion of the nation's vast airspace would be a major step and likely impact travel nationwide, he added. The system operates on a so-called hub-and-spoke model in which passengers using regional airports can connect with major airports to travel around the U.S.",
      "If the airspace around New York were to close, for example, it could affect passengers in multiple cities, according to Jacobson.",
      "\"For us to take such draconian steps to shut it down in sectors of the country would be unprecedented,\" he said. \"If you shut down the New York area, you shut down a lot of the country because of the interconnectivity of the hub-and-spoke system.\"",
      "More controllers calling in sick",
      "With air traffic controllers working without pay during the shutdown, more than usual are calling in sick, Duffy has said. He has said he is discouraging them from taking on side gigs like delivering for Uber or DoorDash to make ends meet during the funding lapse, given the level of focus that their job requires.",
      "\"The longer this goes on, every day, these hardworking Americans have bills they have to pay, and they're being forced to make decisions and choices,\" Duffy said Tuesday. \"As every day goes by, I think the problem is going to only get worse. Not better.\"",
      "At an Oct. 28 news conference at LaGuardia Airport in New York, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels emphasized that his organization's members are under mounting financial pressures.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "The U.S. Travel Association on Monday urged congressional leaders to end the shutdown, which the industry trade group said could disrupt passengers during the busy Thanksgiving holiday. In 2024, 20 million passengers took to the skies over that week.",
      "\"A shutdown places extraordinary strain on federal personnel who are essential to keeping America moving \u2014 from Transportation Security Administration officers to air traffic controllers, who are forced to work without pay,\" the group said in a Nov. 3 letter. \"When staffing shortages worsen, airport wait times grow longer and flight delays and cancellations become more frequent, threatening to derail family travel plans across the country.\"",

      "It's unclear how long it will take some states to issue SNAP payments since this is an unprecedented situation, said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The timing will depend on how fast states can adjust to issue partial SNAP benefits and relay that information to EBT vendors, she added.",
      "\"I would hope that states will move heaven and Earth to get SNAP benefits flowing as quickly as possible,\" she said.",

      "\"I'm a single mom, so it's very frightening,\" Griffin said of missing out on federal nutrition assistance. \"All the kids know is, 'I'm hungry.'\"",
      "Griffin said she typically uses the $1,100 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to pay for food staples she can stretch out for the month, such as spaghetti and canned goods. Without the money, she plans to turn to a local food bank.",

      "In May of 2024, however, a hit-and-run accident required multiple surgeries and left the 64-year-old Lennox unable to work. Without a stable source of income, Lennox said she relies on SNAP, disability and Social Security retirement benefits to pay the bills.

      "After learning that SNAP funding was under threat because of the shutdown, Lennox said she pulled back on buying food by conserving the remaining food stamps on her electronic benefits card. She currently has $240 in food stamp payments, but plans on visiting a local food bank to make ends meet.",

High food prices in recent years mean the payment is insufficient to cover the family's food budget, Hurd told CBS News, noting the demands of feeding her 15-year-old grandson.",
      "With her SNAP payments temporarily suspended, Hurd said she's trying to take it day by day. \"I'm really trying hard not to stress out about it,\" she said.",

      "The deal, announced\u00a0Monday, values the chain at $620 million, including debt. The investors purchasing the company are private equity investment company TriArtisan Capital Advisors, investment firm Treville Capital and Denny's franchisee Yadav Enterprises.",
      "Under the agreement, Denny's shareholders will receive $6.25 per share in cash for each share of Denny's common stock they own, or a total of $322 million. That represents a 52% premium to Denny's closing stock price on Monday.",

      "Founded in 1953 as Danny's Donuts, the company changed its name to Denny's in 1959 to avoid confusion with another chain, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange a decade later.

    "story": [
      "Tesla shareholders are voting this week on whether to award CEO Elon Musk a new pay package\u00a0potentially worth up to $1 trillion over a decade, with some prominent investors in the electric car maker criticizing the compensation plan.",
      "Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which holds a stake in Tesla, on Tuesday said it would vote against the pay package.",
      "\"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution and lack of mitigation of key person risk consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" said Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the country's government pension fund.",
      "The fund has a 1.16% stake in Tesla, the sixth-largest holding among institutional investors.",
      "Another investor, Baron Capital Management, said Monday that it would vote in favor of the package.",
      "Musk \"has built one of the most important companies in the world,\" wrote Ron Baron, founder of the asset management firm. \"He's redefining transportation, energy and humanoid robotics and creating lasting value for shareholders while doing it. His interests are completely aligned with investors.\"",

      "Tesla's board of directors introduced the\u00a0proposed pay package in early September. Musk, who controls nearly 16% of Tesla's outstanding shares, would also receive more voting power under the plan. In a Sept. 5 regulatory\u00a0filing, the board described the proposed compensation package as an \"ambitious plan to retain and incentivize Mr. Musk through the issuance of a highly customized, performance-based restricted stock award.\"",
      "Tesla would be required to hit certain financial and operational milestones for Musk to earn the full pay package. Those include the company reaching a market capitalization of at least $8.5 trillion; delivering 20 million vehicles; producing 1 million self-driving \"robotaxis\"; and manufacturing 1 million of the company's humanoid robots, dubbed Optimus, which are currently under development.",

      "Travelers heading to airports this week may face more flight disruptions as air traffic controllers missed their first full paycheck late last month and with the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on the cusp of becoming the longest in U.S. history.",
      "Almost 6,000 U.S. flights were delayed on Sunday, Nov. 2, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service. Newark Liberty Airport on Sunday had a four-hour ground delay, while staffing triggers \u2014 a Federal Aviation Administration alert system to indicate an air traffic control facility is understaffed \u2014 were reported at airports including Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; and Denver, Colorado.",
      "Airport delays are \"going to get worse,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday.",
      "The shutdown on Tuesday is set to become the longest in history, when it would eclipse the 2018-2019 funding lapse. In the meantime, air traffic controllers and workers for the Transportation Security Administration \u2014 both considered essential workers \u2014 are required to show up at their jobs even though their pay is halted until lawmakers agree on a new deal to fund the federal government.",
      "The longer the shutdown stretches on, the more likely it is to cause flight delays and snarls at security checkpoints, Katy Nastro, a travel expert at Going.com, told CBS News.",
      "\"We're over a month into this shutdown, and in the last few days is really when we've started to see that the seams are ripping,\" Nastro said. \"It's not just in air traffic control staffing triggers, but we're seeing TSA lines hit the 3-4 hour mark.\"",
      "Some Houston travelers faced waits of about an hour to get through airport security lines this weekend, according to CBS affiliate KHOU. Only two out of five security checkpoints are open at Houston's Bush airport, the station noted, while the Houston Chronicle\u00a0reported\u00a0that some people faced waits of three hours to get through the airport's security.",
      "Thanksgiving outlook for air travel",
      "If the shutdown drags longer into November, the real pain point could come during Thanksgiving week, when a record number of Americans are expected to travel for the holidays, Nastro said.",
      "\"I would be cautious if this continues into Thanksgiving \u2014 we're likely to see multiple days of 3 million-plus travelers,\" she said. \"At that point, we would be coming into almost two months of a shutdown.\"",
      "Some holiday travelers might be better off driving to their destinations given the potential for flight disruptions, Nastro added. Booking early morning flights, such as those that depart between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., can also help minimize delays because these departures are more likely to be on time than flights that are scheduled later in the day, travel data shows.",
      "Still, experts said that air safety isn't an issue, given that the FAA will slow flights if there aren't enough air traffic controllers directing flights. That was reiterated by Duffy on Sunday, who told \"Face the Nation\" that the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aca-marketplace-obamacare-health-insurance-premiums-2026-increase-sticker-shock/",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 16:36:58 -0500",
    "summary": "In 2026, premiums for a typical health insurance plan sold through the ACA marketplaces are projected to jump an average of 26%.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act marketplaces opened for enrollment on Nov. 1, with the average premium for a mid-level insurance plan surging 26% this year to $625 per month, according to nonprofit health research firm KFF.",
      "That jump \u2014 the biggest increase in ACA plan rates since 2018 \u2014 is causing sticker shock for some people who rely on the program for health insurance coverage.",
      "\"I've been hearing stories about the price increases, so I've been dreading this week,\" Jeremy Tolbert, a 47-year-old web developer in Lawrence, Kansas, told CBS News. When he logged into his state's marketplace, he was dismayed to find out that his current plan's monthly premium is set to rise to $2,600 a month next year, up from $2,200 a month in 2025.",
      "That doesn't include higher cost-sharing for his family, such as a larger out-of-pocket maximum for 2026, meaning he's facing higher costs on both ends for the same coverage for himself, his wife and their 11-year-old son.",
      "\"I already pay a significant portion of my income for this insurance,\" he noted. \"What the hell am I paying for at this point?\"",
      "Roughly 24 million Americans get their health insurance through an ACA plan.",
      "The 26% premium hike for so-called ACA silver plans reflects what insurers are charging consumers buying plans via the marketplaces. Millions of Americans currently pay below the ACA's market rates because of\u00a0premium tax credits, KFF said. Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025 \u2014 a looming deadline that has contributed to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, as Democratic lawmakers push for Republicans to agree to an extension.",
      "The roughly 22 million people who currently rely on the premium tax credits could see their ACA plan costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",
      "Even those who don't qualify for the credits, as in Tolbert's case, face sharply higher health insurance costs next year, KFF said. The main factors behind that increase are increased demand for costly treatments, such as\u00a0GLP-1 drugs\u00a0for weight loss; higher prices from hospitals and other providers; and insurer projections that millions of people could drop their coverage next year when the premium tax credits expire, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of KFF's program on the ACA.",
      "\"The biggest factor is that health care costs for everybody are going up,\" Cox told CBS News. \"That's driven by the underlying health care costs, hospital costs, doctor visits and drugs.\"",
      "\"The last time we saw premium increases like this was 2017, going into 2018, when we were talking about ACA 'repeal and replace,'\" a period during President Trump's first term when he\u00a0sought to roll back the Affordable Care Act, she added.",
      "Higher ACA insurance costs could spur some people to go without coverage, said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Biden administration.",
      "\"Some will have to go to skimpier plans,\" she noted in a recent conference call organized by left-leaning economic advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative to discuss the ACA premium tax credit expiration. \"Deductibles are going up as well ... [consumers] will be heading into next year with bigger out-of-pocket expenses.\"",
      "For some people, going without health coverage might seem like a financial necessity in the face of sharply higher ACA plan costs in 2026, but ultimately could prove ruinous, KFF's Cox said. \"It's like gambling with your health and your wallet,\" she added. \"You don't know what will happen.\"",
      "In the meantime, Tolbert expressed concern that ACA insurance may become unaffordable for his family if premiums continue to increase at the same pace. That could push him or his wife, who currently stays at home with their son, to look for a job with a bigger employer to secure health insurance, he noted.",
      "\"At this rate, I have one to three more years before I can no longer afford a plan,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture told a federal court that it will tap into a contingency fund to allow states to issue partial SNAP benefits.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture told a federal court that it will tap into a contingency fund to allow states to issue partial November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\"",
      "There is roughly $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover November benefit payments, according to Penn. Officials have said fully covering those benefits would require roughly $9 billion. The $4.6 billion will be used to \"cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments,\" Penn said.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to buy food, and the program ran out of funding over the weekend due to the ongoing shutdown. The federal government funds SNAP by sending money to the states, which oversee food stamp programs for their residents.",
      "Justice Department lawyers separately told the court that the administration will \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds\" by providing states with information on Monday that they can use to calculate benefits due to each eligible household.",
      "The administration said it will \"have made the necessary funds available and have authorized the states to begin disbursements\" once the material has been issued.",
      "Still, relief to food-aid recipients may not be immediate. Penn wrote in his declaration that there could be \"payment errors and significant delays\" because of variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "\"For at least some States, USDA's understanding is that the system changes States must implement to provide the reduced benefit amounts will take anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months,\" he said.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy group that is representing a group of municipalities and nonprofit organizations that sued the Trump administration, said in a statement it is \"considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.\"",
      "\"It shouldn't take a court order to force our president to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,\" Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, pushed the administration to transfer money from other programs to fully fund November benefits, saying the courts \"have made it clear\" that the government has the authority to do so.",
      "\"It is not enough to do the bare minimum \u2014 the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.",
      "The USDA filing came in response to an order issued by Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case brought by nonprofits and municipalities in Rhode Island. Last Friday, McConnell ordered the Trump administration to tap into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP funding caused by the shutdown. The judge gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the funds.",
      "In a separate case in Massachusetts, two dozen states and the District of Columbia filed suit to get the administration to use the contingency funds. The judge in that case agreed with their argument that the government is required to use the money and likewise asked for an update by Monday.",
      "The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress had argued that the contingency fund couldn't legally be used to pay SNAP benefits because the underlying appropriation for the program had lapsed. Both judges disagreed with that argument and said the fund must be used to cover part of the shortfall.",
      "\"There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,\" McConnell wrote in the written version of his order on Saturday.",
      "He also said the government should \"find the additional funds necessary (beyond the contingency funds) to fully fund the November SNAP payments.\" The $5 billion in the contingency fund does not fully cover the $9 billion needed to pay out benefits for the month, and the administration had argued that calculating partial payments would be \"exceedingly difficult, highly disruptive, and delayed.\"",
      "The judge said the government could choose to issue partial payments instead of finding other sources of funding, but added that \"under no circumstances\" could those payments be delayed beyond Wednesday.",
      "The USDA warned late last month that federal food benefits would not go out to roughly 42 million recipients on Nov. 1 after it declined to tap into contingency funds to keep food stamp payments flowing during the shutdown. The agency pinned the blame for the pause on congressional Democrats for failing to back a GOP-backed stopgap measure that would fund federal agencies.",
      "The shutdown entered its 34th day Monday and is poised to become the longest shutdown in U.S. history if lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a spending measure by late Tuesday.",
      "The initial decision to halt the food aid appeared to be a shift from the USDA's plan for a lapse in federal funding that was issued Sept. 30. The agency said in its plan that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits\" in the event of a funding lapse.",
      "But the USDA wrote in a memo to states late last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to over regular benefits,\" and said the money was meant for priorities like assisting people in disaster areas.",
      "Faced with the looming cutoff of food stamp payments, half the states and the District of Columbia, as well as the municipalities, sought relief from the federal courts. Some states said they would work to continue providing assistance to food-aid beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps.",

      "\"1929\" by Andrew Ross Sorkin",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Charles Mitchell strode up the steps of 55 Wall Street, determined to project his usual sense of confidence and certitude. It had been a crushing afternoon. As he returned to his office, he knew that the eyes of Wall Street were on him \u2014 everyone from the traders in the street to his own secretary was assessing his gait and searching his face, trying to read meaning into every twitch, every line, every wrinkle.",
      "In his gray three\u2011piece suit, shoulders back, Mitchell kept up his smile as he passed through the glass\u2011domed central hall of his National City Bank. With its eighty\u2011three\u2011foot ceiling and two solid bronze doors protecting a safe weighing some three hundred tons, the bank was the largest in the country.",
      "It was just past 5:30 p.m. on Monday, October 28, 1929. Hours earlier, the stock market had closed with a sharp, dizzying drop of 13 percent after a week of downward convulsions; today was by far the greatest fall. The darkening downtown streets still teemed with anxious brokers in their fedoras and flat caps, messenger boys and switchboard girls, all gossiping and speculating about the collapse. What caused the fall? How much further might it go tomorrow? Would the markets even open?",
      "As Mitchell made his way to his office, the teller windows he passed reflected the weary puffiness under his eyes and his disheveled, graying eyebrows. He collapsed into the chair behind his mahogany desk. The room was furnished with the high formality befitting an eighteenth\u2011century statesman: antique wood chairs, a grandfather clock that stood against the cream\u2011white woodwork flanked by portraits of George Washington orchestrating the newly independent nation with the purpose and resolve that Mitchell sought to emulate in his own life.",
      "The athletic fifty\u2011two\u2011year\u2011old bank chairman \u2014 an unusually optimistic man whom the press called \"Sunshine Charlie\" \u2014 had spent the afternoon in emergency meetings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, puzzling over how to calm the market. It was a moment for which a self\u2011consciously Great Man like Mitchell should have been utterly prepared. He had the experience, the stature, and the steely nerves necessary to steer Wall Street through these tough times.",
      "Yet he felt exposed, vulnerable.",
      "But he didn't have time to consider his emotional state.",
      "He walked upstairs to confer with Hugh Baker, who ran National City's stock\u2011trading unit.",
      "Baker, a tall, bald man with piercing eyes, began to explain to Mitchell, calmly, if somewhat obliquely, what had taken place while Mitchell had been at the Federal Reserve.",
      "\"Our portfolio today has been tremendously increased in our holdings of National City Bank stock,\" Baker told him.",
      "Mitchell stared at him, waiting to hear exactly what he meant.",
      "Baker finally blurted out: \"We purchased seventy\u2011odd thousand shares.\"",
      "Mitchell, who could calculate numbers instantly in his head, immediately grasped the nature and scale of the problem. That is unbelievable, he thought. The bank didn't have the cash to pay for so many shares. He was outraged \u2014 and terrified. Everything he had built was suddenly at grave risk of collapse.",
      "Barely a month earlier, Mitchell had been on top of the world. He had finalized an agreement to take over the Corn Exchange Bank, a bold acquisition that would turn National City from the largest bank in the country into the largest in the world, stealing the mantle from London and helping New York finally eclipse its rival city as the world financial center. This was history in the making, an overthrow of the established order, the kind of gambit that made Mitchell a king among men.",
      "But to pull off the deal, Mitchell had made a big \u2014 and risky \u2014 bet on the strength of his own stock. Corn Exchange shareholders could take $360 in cash for each of their shares, or four fifths of a share in National City Bank. On paper, the stock was the better deal: As long as National City stock stayed above $450, four fifths of a share was worth more than $360 in cash. At the time the deal was struck, it was comfortably higher, trading at $496 a share. Mitchell needed it to stay there until the deal could be completed, likely in the next month \u2014 because, in truth, National City didn't have the cash to pay everyone, a crucial detail he kept to himself.",
      "So he quietly instructed his traders to buy the bank's shares whenever the price slipped.",
      "In a relatively stable market, this posed no problem. Big publicly traded companies bought back their own shares all the time. In a rapidly falling market, however, doing so could quickly become like shoveling money into a furnace, which was what had been happening that afternoon. In the chaos of all that selling pressure, National City's bids had been accepted so quickly that they lost track of how many they had amassed. By the time traders got a handle on the situation, National City had committed to buy seventy\u2011one thousand of its own shares, far more than it could afford to hold.",
      "\"With that news,\" he told Baker, \"I could be knocked over with a feather.\"",
      "There were very few good options. To fund their daily operations, big banks like National City had to constantly borrow against their assets. But banking law prevented them from offering their own stock as collateral. Thus, those seventy\u2011one thousand shares \u2014 which cost about $32 million \u2014 were a deadweight that could possibly take down the whole bank.",
      "\"It would be embarrassing for us to attempt to borrow on that stock in other banks,\" Mitchell said, knowing full well that his rivals would seize on any such move as a sign of vulnerability. With the market in free fall, short sellers \u2014 traders who bet that stocks would go down \u2014 were lining up targets, probing for weakness.",
      "The stock market was at the breaking point. Sales volume had overwhelmed the human apparatus of the trading floor to such an extent that, on the previous Thursday, the ticker had fallen four hours behind in reporting stock prices, more than twice the longest previous delay.",
      "What this meant was that the big board of prices that loomed over the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was hopelessly inaccurate. Trading stocks in this environment was like being a gambler at a baseball game in the eighth inning and looking at a scoreboard that hadn't been updated since the third, while everybody around you was shouting conflicting opinions about which team was ahead and by how much. The prices of stocks sold privately \u2014 known as \"off\u2011exchange,\" which was the case with National City shares \u2014 were even further behind because they were tied to the broader market's movements without being fully updated in real time, exacerbating the delay. For Wall Street traders, the only prudent decision was to sell and get the hell out of the market. Which is exactly what they were doing.",
      "Mitchell knew that if he tried to unload even a small fraction of National City's position back into such a weak market, rumors would begin to fly about the bank's solvency, and that could easily turn into a vicious cycle that would be impossible to stop. If prices declined fast enough, it could trigger a much larger crisis: A \"lack of confidence might bring a run,\" Mitchell told Baker, envisioning depositors lining up outside every one of its fifty\u2011eight branches around the country.",
      "A run on the country's largest bank. There was nothing bankers feared more.",

      "The wealthy emirate is known for its extravagant ventures, including an enormous mall with an indoor ski area, the world's tallest building and an artificial island dotted with five-star hotels.",
      "\"The wait is finally over,\" Serkan Sagsoz, co-founder of the Julith cafe with the pricey offering,\u00a0said in a Facebook video. \"The world's most celebrated and highest graded coffee of all time has arrived at Julith.\"",
      "Located in an industrial neighborhood that has become a hotspot for coffee lovers, Julith plans to serve \"around 400 cups\" of the precious beverage starting on Saturday, Sagsoz told AFP.",
      "\"We felt Dubai was the perfect place for our investment,\" Sagsoz said.",
      "For a price tag of 3,600 dirhams (around $980), the brew offers an experience of floral and fruity flavors reminiscent of tea.",
      "\"There are white floral notes like jasmine, citrus flavors like orange and bergamot and a hint of apricot and peach,\" said Sagsoz, who previously ran a cafe in his native Turkey.",
      "\"It's like honey, delicate and sweet,\" he said.",
      "Dubai notched a Guinness World Record for the world's most expensive cup of coffee last month, when Roasters offered one for 2,500 dirhams.",

      "It claimed to have paid the highest price ever for coffee.",
      "Twenty kilograms of the beans went for around 2.2 million dirhams, or $600,000, Julith said in a press release.",
      "Asian buyers, Emirati coffee enthusiasts and coffee bean collectors have since reached out to the cafe in the hopes of securing some of the \"Nido 7 Geisha\" beans, which are grown on a plantation near Panama's Baru volcano.",
      "But the cafe said it does not plan to share its treasure, beyond a small amount reserved for Dubai's ruling family.",
      "Coffee prices surging in U.S.",
      "The pricey cup of coffee is being offered as the cost of roasted coffee has jumped 18.9% in the U.S., according to the most recent Consumer Price Index data for September.",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data\u00a0shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are driving this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, is depressing crop yields, Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023, the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according\u00a0to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, which has led producers there to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Nov 2025 07:43:48 -0400",
    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mother living in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Saturday isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation\u00a0and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

      "SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Nov. 1 isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.",
      "Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?",
      "While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.",
      "Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.",
      "\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.",
      "Will SNAP recipients get paid retroactively for missed payments?",
      "The USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.",
      "But social service experts who spoke with CBS News said they expect the USDA to pay the delayed November benefits once federal funding resumes.",
      "\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.",
      "Federal rules\u00a0governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.",
      "\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Can states step in to fund SNAP?",
      "While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.",
      "Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers\u00a0urging\u00a0Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.",
      "In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u00a0signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.",
      "Other states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said\u00a0last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.",
      "In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 20:09:49 -0400",
    "summary": "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything\" if federal food aid is halted, one single mom said.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are sliding toward a financial cliff as the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0stretches into a second month, with four federal assistance programs for low-income families set to run out of funding on Nov. 1.",
      "Some families could lose access to multiple sources of government support. Ashley Trent, a 37-year-old single mother of six, expressed concern she could soon be without aid provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, which provides food aid for mothers of young children.",
      "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything,\" Trent, a Bloomington, Ill., resident who works full-time as a housing navigator, told CBS News. \"It's very stressful \u2014 what bills will I have to put off? I have a car note, I have insurance, I have clothes I have to get my kids because it's getting colder.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds SNAP and WIC, has said it will halt payments for the anti-hunger programs on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. Head Start programs serving 65,000 low-income children will also lose federal funding on Saturday, potentially disrupting preschool for thousands of families,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Head Start Association.",
      "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps struggling households heat their homes, could be next to run short of funding.",
      "Halting funding for these programs \u2014 which help cover food, education, and energy costs \u2014 could have lasting consequences for poor families already strained by high grocery and utility prices, said Ailen Arreaza, executive director of the advocacy group ParentsTogether Action.",
      "Although funding will resume once Congress passes legislation to reopen the government, she warned that the damage to households could persist.",
      "\"What we are hearing from parents is desperation \u2014 parents going without meals, making impossible decisions about not paying bills or going without medication,\" Arreaza told CBS News. \"This has so many implications, because these kids need these programs to get ahead.\"",
      "Experts note that hunger can hinder children's ability to learn, while parents who fall behind on bills may face utility shutoffs or other lasting setbacks.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The USDA is set to\u00a0halt SNAP payments on Nov. 1, leaving about 42 million Americans uncertain how they'll afford groceries next month. Recipients receive an average of about $187 a month on prepaid cards that can be used to buy food at grocery stores, farmers' markets and other retailers.",
      "A prolonged cessation in food-stamp funding isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday that the Trump administration is required by law to use contingency funds to pay at least partial SNAP benefits. The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Meanwhile, more than a dozen states are trying to fill the gap by using state funds to support food aid or local food banks. But food bank leaders say charities can't make up for a cutoff in food stamps.",
      "\"It's going to hurt us really bad,\" said Taylour Grant, 29, a Tampa medical assistant who relies on $970 a month in SNAP benefits to feed her four children, plus WIC support for her youngest, who is 1-year-old. \"It's really scary because I know I'll go without to make sure my kids are fed.\"",
      "Grant said many people misunderstand who relies on SNAP. \"We're not on it because we want to be \u2014 no one makes enough to live off these days. That help is really needed,\" she said.",
      "WIC",
      "Nearly 7 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children under 5 who receive WIC could lose federal aid in November because of the government shutdown.",
      "Unlike food stamps, WIC provides funds specifically to purchase formula and nutritious foods for pregnant women and young children, though many families rely on both programs, said Georgia Machell, CEO of the National WIC Association.",
      "\"None of these programs operate in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Often, if a family is participating in WIC, they're also participating in SNAP.\"",
      "WIC continued paying benefits in October after the Trump administration tapped\u00a0$300 million\u00a0in leftover tariff revenue from the previous fiscal year. But with the stalemate in Congress continuing into November, that funding could run out.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it could tap additional tariff revenue to fund the program. At this point, the program is set to delay payments on Nov. 1, according to the National WIC Association.",
      "WIC has been able to maintain funding during previous shutdowns in its 50-year history, according to the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on stopping hunger. \"The disruptions we're concerned about would be fairly historic,\" Machell said.",
      "Some states have pledged to use their own funds to keep WIC running, but many lack the budget, according to FRAC.",
      "Head Start",
      "About 140 Head Start programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will lose federal funding with the shutdown set to extend past Nov. 1, affecting roughly 65,000 children, according to the National Head Start Association. Nationwide, about 750,000 children are enrolled in Head Start.",
      "Some programs may not be able to stay open, regional program directors warn.",
      "\"Everybody is trying to do everything they can to keep children in classrooms and families at work,\" Michelle Haimowitz, executive director of the Massachusetts Head Start Association,\u00a0told CBS News Boston. \"But it is incredibly difficult to operate without those federal funds.\"",
      "Minnesota mother Jaycee Chrudimsky said she fears that the closure of her local Head Start program could force her to miss work and affect her 4-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It would impact her, and that's the thing I worry about the most, because she looks forward to coming to school every single day and seeing her friends and being a part of the program,\" Chrudimsky\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota this week.",
      "LIHEAP",
      "Another program threatened by the shutdown is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The program helps about 6 million low-income households pay their energy bills.",
      "\"We are now at a point where the government shutdown is going to cause serious delays in the release of LIHEAP funds,\" Wolfe told CBS News.",
      "The delay could leave millions of families behind on utility bills and facing power shutoffs just as\u00a0energy prices are skyrocketing, he added.",
      "NEADA projects the\u00a0average cost for people to heat a home this winter\u00a0will rise nearly 8%.",
      "\"It's a perfect storm of misery for low- and middle-income households,\" Wolfe said.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 18:19:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol doesn't expect AI to replace baristas as the coffee chain focuses on improving the \"human-to-human experience\" for customers.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, inheriting a company facing its first revenue decline in four years amid customer complaints about high prices and long wait times. A year later, the coffee giant has halted the slide but faces fresh pressures, from surging coffee bean costs to store closures.",
      "Coffee prices\u00a0jumped 30% from January through September, squeezing Starbucks' profit margins even as Niccol vowed not to raise menu costs this year. The restaurant chain said last month it would spend $1 billion to close underperforming stores and cut 900 jobs.",
      "As Niccol told CBS News' Jo Ling Kent, the retail chain can't rule out price hikes in 2026 due to rising coffee prices, although he described this step as a \"last resort.\" At the same time, Niccol noted that Starbucks has no plans to introduce a value menu like McDonald's and other fast-food chains appealing to budget-conscious patrons.",
      "\"We have a huge point of difference and that is, I think, that customer connection and the experience you get in our stores,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"I just believe, at the end of the day, the experience sets us apart from everybody else.\"",
      "He added, \"Pricing would be one of those things that we do as a last resort, and we do it very surgically. To say never, you know, I don't think you can do that in this environment.\"",
      "\"Human-to-human\"",
      "Starbucks' reboot involves what the company calls its \"Green Apron service model,\" which aims to hire more baristas, improve customer service and cut down on customer wait times.",
      "\"What we're doing right now is making sure that we're staffed correctly,\" Niccol said. \"The teams are trained correctly for the demand that we know we have in the morning, and we know that we're growing in the afternoon.\"",
      "While other companies are turning to artificial intelligence to replace some workers, Niccol said he doesn't envision AI supplanting baristas. He said the technology could be useful for behind-the-scenes tasks, such as managing the company's supply chain.",
      "\"I don't see [AI] replacing our baristas \u2014 that human-to-human experience is just too important,\" Niccol said. \"And I think it really separates our experience from everybody else.\"",
      "While Starbucks is bolstering its barista ranks, it also faces the threat of strikes from Starbucks Workers United, which represents 9,500 workers in some 550 Starbucks cafes across the country. Overall, the company has roughly 201,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Niccol said he's open to talking with union members, but also described his company's pay and benefits as generous, adding that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",
      "\"We already give them the best job in retail. We have the lowest turnover in the industry \u2014 it's below 50%,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"We also have the best benefits in the industry, and we actually have the best wages in the industry.\"",
      "Although other companies have noted a pullback from low- or middle-income consumers as inflation continues to tick upwards, Niccols said Starbucks patrons are still opening their wallets.",
      "\"Transactions are up, our sales are up,\" Niccol said. \"What we hear from them is they love the experience and they think it's a great value proposition, so I think they're being much more judicious in where they want to spend their money.\"",
      "He added, \"And I think it's really important that you give them a great experience so that it justifies why they chose to spend money with you.\"",

      "Member's Mark Super Greens Powder Supplements, which were sold at the discount chain's stores nationwide and online, have been pulled from store shelves because they contain moringa leaf powder that may be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an alert posted on its website.",
      "\"If you have any of the products listed below in your home, throw them out or return them to the store,\" the agency said, while noting that the product has not been recalled.",
      "Three of the people who contracted Salmonella were hospitalized, according to the agency. Illnesses, which were reported between May and September, were confirmed in Florida, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, South Carolina and Virginia.",
      "The source of the Salmonella was traced to a single lot of organic moringa leaf powder imported from Vallon Farm Direct in Jodhpur, India, according to an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration. State health officials in Virginia and Michigan collected and tested samples of the product from the homes of people who fell ill.",
      "The CDC said it may add other Vallon Farm products with moringa leaf powder to avoid as the agency's investigation continues.",
      "Moringa is a plant native to India and other countries prized for essential nutrients including protein, amino acids, vitamins and minerals, according to research published by the National Institutes of Health. Its leaves can be dried and powdered.",

      "Diane Reynolds said she was caught off guard when someone contacted the Maryland retiree online and said access to her computer had been blocked for safety reasons.",
      "\"There was a voice message that was coming on with this that said, 'Don't turn your computer on, don't turn your computer off,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Reynolds was also instructed to call a phone number she was led to believe would provide her with tech support. Instead, she was connected to a\u00a0scam artist\u00a0who claimed that hackers had obtained access to her bank account. The only way to protect her money was to convert the funds into bitcoin, the person told Reynolds.",
      "She withdrew her entire bank account balance, which totaled $13,100, and followed the scammer's directions to go to a bitcoin ATM at a nearby gas station. The ATM was operated by Athena Bitcoin, which has more than 4,000 such terminals across the U.S.",
      "Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb said such incidents highlight the surge in cryptocurrency scams linked to bitcoin ATM providers, resulting in the theft of millions of dollars.",
      "\"Bitcoin ATMs are a tool that scammers, that criminals, are using to separate people, including D.C. residents, from their hard-earned money,\" Schwalb told CBS News. \"Athena, as a bitcoin operator, knows that its kiosks are being used by this element, and yet [has] failed to put proper anti-fraud prevention systems in place to keep it from happening.\"",
      "He added, \"What makes it worse is they are profiting from this because they're charging very substantial fees.\"",
      "Schwalb in September filed a lawsuit against Athena, alleging that it charges \"undisclosed fees on deposits that it knows are often the result of scams, and for failing to implement adequate anti-fraud measures.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Athena Bitcoin said it \"strongly disagrees with the allegations\" and that it will contest the charges in court.",

      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",
      "Other holiday outlook forecasts from groups like Abode for Business and polling firm\u00a0Gallup point to the same conclusion as Visa's: Americans are planning to dish out billions on holiday gifts, travel and food despite their gloomy views on the economy.",
      "Still, some are exercising caution in their purchasing, Brown said, noting that low- and middle-income households will face the biggest tradeoffs this holiday season. Higher costs for essentials such as groceries are leaving them with less room for discretionary spending, he added.",
      "\"There is absolutely an undercurrent of trying to make the dollar stretch, given some of those necessities are costing a bit more this season,\" Brown said.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 19:24:35 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday over whether a federal emergency powers law authorizes President Trump's most sweeping tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A divided Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared skeptical of President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on nearly every country under a federal emergency powers law, as the justices tested a centerpiece of his economic agenda and the limits of presidential powers.",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs marks the first in which the Supreme Court weighed the legal merits of one of the president's signature policies implemented in his second term. Arguments spanned nearly three hours, with the justices asking probing questions of lawyers for the Trump administration and a group of small businesses challenging the legality of the president's tariffs.",
      "But several of the justices appeared uncomfortable with the breadth of power Mr. Trump is asserting without Congress clearly authorizing him to levy broad tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.",
      "Several justices noted that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as IEEPA, which the president has relied on to impose the duties, does not mention the word \"tariff,\" and has never before been used by a president to justify the levies, until now. The Trump administration has argued that the phrase \"regulate importation\" in the law gives the president authority to set import taxes.",
      "But Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer to identity any other provision of the U.S. code where the phrase \"regulate importation\" has been used to confer an authority to impose tariffs, while Chief Justice John Roberts said that Mr. Trump is claiming \"major authority\" to levy duties on any product from any country at any rate for any length of time.",
      "\"The statute doesn't use the word tariffs,\" Roberts said, adding that while the duties deal with foreign powers, \"the vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been a core power of Congress.\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch, meanwhile, raised separation-of-powers concerns and questioned the administration's assertion that Congress, through IEEPA, granted the president broad emergency authority over a foreign-affairs matter. What would stop Congress from \"abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce\" or declare war and give that power to the president?\" he asked.",
      "Once Congress delegates its authority to the president, it's difficult to reclaim, Gorsuch said, warning that the administration's theory marked a \"one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people's representatives.\"",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh appeared sympathetic to the Trump administration's argument. He argued that Congress enacted a statute that gave the president an array of tools for responding to an emergency, and questioned why the law would allow for the imposition of a trade embargo, which may be viewed as an extreme step, as opposed to tariffs, a more targeted punishment.",
      "\"You're forcing the president to respond to an emergency ... and you're taking away the president's suite of tools when the one is much more extreme that is authorized,\" he said. \"That just seems a bit unusual.\"",
      "Kavanaugh pointed to Mr. Trump's tariffs on goods from India over its purchase of Russian oil, which the president is using to pressure Moscow to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"If that's gone, that's a tool that's designed \u2014 talk about foreign-facing, the most serious crisis in the world,\" he said. \"And that's out the window.\"",
      "Trump's tariffs",
      "Three lower courts have concluded that most of the president's tariffs are illegal, and a ruling from the Supreme Court upholding those decisions would deal a blow to Mr. Trump's plans to use tariffs as leverage to push U.S. trading partners to negotiate better trade deals. The president has also claimed that tariffs help to boost domestic manufacturing.",
      "At issue in the case are two sets of duties that Mr. Trump rolled out through a series of executive orders earlier this year. The president has relied on IEEPA to impose the tariffs.",
      "The first tranche set a baseline rate of 10%\u00a0on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as well as higher reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries in response to what he said are \"large and persistent\" trade deficits. The second targeted China, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of varying rates for what he asserted was their failure to stop the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S.",
      "In his executive orders, the president declared trade imbalances and the trafficking of drugs across U.S. borders as national emergencies, which unlocked IEEPA's powers. The law authorizes the president to \"regulate \u2026 importation\" to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security, foreign policy or the U.S. economy. Mr. Trump has argued that trade deficits and the failure to curtail the flow of illicit drugs into the country qualify as such a threat.",
      "Since Mr. Trump announced the import taxes in February and April \u2014 on what he called \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 the administration has reached trade deals with at least 10 countries and the European Union, and said it is \"actively negotiating\" with other nations.",
      "But after the rollout of the new levies, two sets of small businesses and a group of 12 states filed lawsuits arguing that IEEPA doesn't authorize the president's sweeping action. The first case was brought in Washington, D.C., by a pair of Illinois-based educational toy companies. The others, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, came from a group of five small businesses and Democratic officials from 12 states.",
      "The U.S. district court in Washington and the Court of International Trade separately ruled against the administration, concluding that IEEPA doesn't give the president the authority to impose his global and trafficking-related tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the trade court's decision in cases from the five small businesses and states,\u00a0ruled 7-4 that many of the president's levies are illegal. The appeals court found that while IEEPA may authorize some tariffs, the law didn't allow for those \"of the magnitude\" of Mr. Trump's.",
      "Still, it allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the sweeping tariffs while the legal battles play out.",
      "Mr. Trump has also continued to rely on IEEPA to impose new levies or tweak existing rates, including\u00a0raising Canadian tariffs\u00a0to 35% (though many of its goods are subject to exemptions),\u00a0imposing an additional 40% duty on Brazil\u00a0and\u00a0threatening China\u00a0with an additional 100% duty, though the president has since walked that back. Mr. Trump announced last week following a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would be\u00a0reducing the tariffs on goods\u00a0imported from China.",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs on an extremely fast timeline, having\u00a0agreed in September to decide the cases, and could move quickly to issue a ruling.",
      "A key issue in the case may be how the justices view the tariffs: whether they're an exercise of the president's power over foreign affairs or a tax on American consumers.",
      "Neal Katyal, representing the businesses challenging the tariffs, opened his arguments by saying, \"Tariffs are taxes\" and noting that Constitution vested that power in Congress. Echoing Gorsuch, Katyal said that if Congress were to delegate tariffing power to the president, it would be \"a one-way ratchet.\"",
      "\"We will never get this power back if the government wins this case,\" he said.",
      "But Sauer told the high court that they are a tool to regulate foreign commerce.",
      "Roberts acknowledged the tension between the powers at issue, saying \"tariffs are a tax, and that's a core power of Congress.\" But the chief justice also described the levies as a \"foreign-facing tax,\" which involves foreign affairs, a core power of the executive.",
      "\"One thing is quite clear, is that the foreign-facing tariffs have in several situations, were quite effective in achieving a particular objective. So I don't think you can just separate it,\" he told Katyal. \"When you say, well, this is a tax, Congress's power, it implicates very directly the president's foreign affairs power.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds the tariffs to be illegal, as lower courts have done, one question is how potential reimbursements would be handled. Barrett was the only justice to ask about that process, noting that some have said the refunds of tariffs collected from U.S. importers would be \"a mess.\" Katyal said he was only representing five companies, not a class action, and the government would refund the tariffs they paid. He said there was a specialized body of case law to address refunds, though \"it's difficult.\" He suggested the court could offer prospective relief, but there are \"a lot of possibilities.\"",
      "Trump administration argues for presidential powers",
      "In urging the high court to uphold the duties, the Trump administration has argued that Congress has long given the president broad authority to impose tariffs to address emergencies. IEEPA, Sauer wrote in a filing, is a continuation of that tradition because it gives the president the power to \"regulate \u2026 importation.\"",
      "Sauer also said that the tariffs are an exercise of Mr. Trump's power over national security and foreign affairs, and courts should give deference to his determination that the duties are best suited for addressing national emergencies arising from trade deficits and drug-trafficking.",
      "Invalidating those levies, Sauer wrote, would have \"catastrophic consequences\" for national security, foreign policy and the economy.",
      "\"To the President, these cases present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump is highly invested in the case, calling it \"one of the most important in the history of the country.\" The president floated attending the arguments in person, but he reversed course Sunday, writing on social media that he did \"not want to distract from the importance of this decision.\"",
      "Underscoring the importance of the case to the Trump administration, three members of Mr. Trump's Cabinet were in attendance: Treasury Secretary Scot Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.",
      "Asked about the arguments later Wednesday, Mr. Trump told Fox News' Bret Baier a loss would be \"devastating for our country,\" calling it \"one of the most important cases in the history of our country.\"",
      "Businesses warn of economic impact",
      "On the other side, the small businesses warned in court papers that Mr. Trump's tariffs have significant economic consequences. An analysis from the Tax Foundation found the duties will impose $1.7 trillion in new taxes on Americans by 2035, reduce GDP growth by 0.7% per year, and reduce income by 1.1% in 2026.",
      "Katyal, who argued on behalf of the companies before the Supreme Court, said the Trump administration's interpretation of IEEPA is a \"breathtaking assertion\" of power that requires explicit authorization from Congress. IEEPA, he said, doesn't even mention the word tariff or duty, and no president has understood the law to authorize them.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with Mr. Trump that the power to tax is found in IEEPA through the phrase \"regulate \u2026 importation,\" then \"the president, empowered by a supercharged U.S. Code, could tax everything from autos to zoos,\" Katyal wrote in a filing.",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that trade deficits hardly constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat,\" as imbalances have lasted for five decades, and Mr. Trump himself has described them as \"persistent.\"",
      "Additionally, the power to levy taxes and duties rests squarely with Congress, and any delegations of that power have been \"explicit and strictly limited,\" they said. And indeed, there are numerous other statutes in which Congress has delegated its tariffing power \u2014 some of which have been used by Mr. Trump \u2014 though they put constraints on the president.",
      "Testing the boundaries of presidential authority",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's efforts to use IEEPA to impose his sweeping tariffs comes as he has tested the boundaries of his presidential authority, including through his firings of independent agency officials, the withholding of $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress and his efforts to overhaul the executive branch.",
      "Those cases have already been before the Supreme Court, though at earlier stages than the challenges to Mr. Trump's tariffs. In most of those emergency appeals, the conservative justices have allowed the Trump administration to temporarily enforce its policies while proceedings in the lower courts continue.",
      "Like those other cases, the dispute over whether Mr. Trump has the authority to impose duties on nearly every country under IEEPA without Congress could have significant implications for presidential power.",
      "The Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad assertions of executive authority on issues of major political and economic significance when Congress has not spoken clearly, invoking what's called the major questions doctrine to invalidate former President Joe Biden's plan to wipe away more than $400 billion in student loan debt and block an eviction moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "That legal principle is raised in the battle over his tariffs, though the Trump administration argues that it doesn't apply to matters of national security and foreign policy.",
      "\"Judges lack the institutional competence to determine when foreign affairs pose an unusual and extraordinary threat that requires an emergency response; that is a task for the political Branches,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "But lawyers for the small businesses counter that tariffs are a tax on the American people, and the Constitution has vested the taxing power in Congress.",
      "\"The Framers understood that taxation is a potent power that can destroy the taxed as it fills the sovereign's coffers. The Constitution vests that extraordinary power exclusively in the branch of government considered most responsive to the citizenry: Congress,\" lawyers for the Illinois companies wrote in a filing. \"This Court should not lightly assume that Congress abdicated its core taxing power to permit the President to tax Americans with virtually no limits.\"",

      "California voters have passed Proposition 50, CBS News projects, approving a measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats that will redraw the state's congressional districts.",
      "The measure is intended to make five Republican-held congressional districts in California more favorable to Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections in an effort to offset redistricting efforts in Texas that flipped five Democratic House seats to Republicans.",
      "\"It was not just a victory tonight for the Democratic Party. It was a victory for the United States of America, for the people of this country, the principles that our Founding Fathers lived and died for,\" Newsom said in a press conference after the measure passed. \"We're proud here in California to be a part of this narrative.\"",
      "Proposition 50's passage drew swift reaction from high-profile opponents of the measure, including Republican political donor Charles Munger, Jr.",
      "\"For what looms for the people of California, I am saddened by the passage of Proposition 50,\" Munger Jr. said. \"But I am content in this, at least: that our campaign educated the people of California so they could make an informed, if in my view unwise, decision about such a technical but critical issue as redistricting reform, a decision forced to be made over such a very short time.\"",

      "Billionaire investor Tom Steyer has been a major supporter of the measure and called its approval \"an enormous victory for our state, our country and our democracy.\"",
      "\"In fact, voters all across the country tonight sent a clear signal tonight that when Democrats fight for working people and their interests, Democrats win,\" Steyer said in a statement.",
      "Republican Congressman Kevin Kiley, whose District 3 will be heavily impacted by the redrawn district boundaries, called the measure \"a symptom of our country's political divisions.\"",
      "\"The reason I opposed Prop. 50, even as I also oppose what's happened in other states, is because I believe fighting fire with fire burns everything down,\" Kiley said. \"With California's new gerrymander, the redistricting arms race has no end in sight\u2026 It's a race to the bottom that degrades democracy everywhere.\"",
      "Republican Congressman Doug LaMalfa, whose District 1 will also be heavily impacted by the new maps, said opponents of the measure expect to take legal action as early as this week.",
      "\"Should these results stick, the imbalance in California between rural and urban voices will get that much worse, essentially silencing our portion of the state,\" Lamalfa said. Those of us who support fair maps will continue to oppose Newsom's scheme, and we expect to file suit on Wednesday. I hope and expect the courts will see this for what it is-blatantly corrupt and unconstitutional.\"",
      "Jessica Millan Patterson, chair of the No on Prop 50 Stop Sacramento's Power Grab campaign, expressed disappointment in the decision.",
      "\"In the end, the tens of millions poured in to promote these gerrymandered maps were too much to overcome, as Newsom put his national ambitions ahead of protecting California's voter-approved independent redistricting commission and the millions of voices now silenced,\" Patterson said. \"Though this isn't the outcome we hoped for, we're proud to have stood for fair maps and honest representation for all Californians.\"",

      "Newsom also called on other states to follow California's lead and recognize \"what's at stake.\"",
      "\"We all must contribute a verse,\" Newsom said. \"And so we need the state of Virginia, we need the state of Maryland, we need our friends in New York and Illinois and Colorado, we need to see other states, their remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things to meet this moment head on as well, to recognize what we're up against in 2026.\"",

      "Proposition 50 was created to redraw congressional districts to make five of them currently held by GOP House members  more favorable to being won by Democrats in next year's midterms. Still, there is no guarantee that Democrats will win the seats even though voters have approved the new maps.",
      "The five Republican-led congressional districts in the crosshairs under Proposition 50 are Rep. LaMalfa's District 1, Rep. Kiley's District 3, Rep. David Valadao's District 22, Rep. Ken Calvert's District 41, and Rep. Darrell Issa's District 48.",
      "Who is running for California's new districts?",
      "Former California senator and physician Dr. Richard Pan announced he is running for California's new District 6. The new District 6 includes parts of Sacramento, North Highlands and Roseville. Pan, a Democrat, had previously announced that he was running for District 3, an area that includes Rancho Cordova, Folsom and the Lake Tahoe area.",
      "Rep. Ami Bera announced minutes after the passage of Proposition 50 that he would be seeking re-election for California's new District 3. Bera, a Democrat, currently represents District 6 and said he has represented about 60% of the new District 3 at some point during his time in Congress.",
      "District 8 Rep. John Garamendi said he would seek re-election in his district, which is now expanded to include Vacaville, Rio Vista, Western Lodi and south Davis.",
      "Republican Rep. Ken Calvert said he will run for the new 40th Congressional District. Calvert currently represents District 41, an area that includes Riverside County cities such as Corona, Palm Springs and Lake Elsinore. Calvert said he's represented 70% of the new District 40, such as Lake Elsinore, Wildomar and Temescal Valley.",
      "Hours after Calvert's announcement, Rep. Young Kim said she will run for re-election in District 40, setting the stage for a showdown between two Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections.",

    "summary": "President Vladimir Putin says Russia has adhered to a ban on nuclear test explosions after President Trump claimed Moscow is testing nuclear weapons.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed his government to submit proposals on the possible resumption of nuclear weapons testing in response to President Trump instructing the Pentagon to do so \"on an equal basis\" with other countries.",
      "In a meeting Wednesday with his Security Council, Putin said Russia has adhered to the international Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which prohibits nuclear test explosions.",
      "But, he said, \"if the United States or any other state party to the Treaty was to conduct such tests, Russia would be under obligation to take reciprocal measures.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in an\u00a0interview with 60 Minutes\u00a0that Russia is among a handful of countries testing nuclear weapons when asked about his order.",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell. \"We're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.\"",
      "It is unclear what type of testing Mr. Trump is ordering. The last time the U.S. detonated a nuclear device as part of a test was in 1992.",
      "\"No one knows what Trump meant about 'nuclear testing' (he probably doesn't himself),\" Dmirty Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, wrote in a post on social media Wednesday.",
      "\"But he's the president of the United States,\" his post continued. \"And the consequences of such words are inescapable: Russia will be forced to assess the expediency of conducting full-fledged nuclear tests itself.\"",
      "China was the first of the nations accused by Mr. Trump to deny any secret nuclear testing. A Pakistani official told CBS News that the country \"will not be the first to resume nuclear tests.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the assertion to O'Donnell just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. Russia's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1990, and China's was in 1996.",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.",
      "Along with China and several other nuclear powers, however, the U.S. has never ratified the treaty, a situation that Putin highlighted in 2023 when he decided to\u00a0revoke Moscow's ratification.",
      "While Russia has stepped up its own tests of nuclear-capable and even\u00a0nuclear-powered weapons systems, it has not announced any resumption of nuclear test detonations.",
      "Putin's revocation of Russia's CTBT ratification exactly two years ago fueled speculation that he could order new nuclear detonation tests, along with calls from hawkish members of the Russian parliament for the country to do so. Putin previously suggested that Russia would resume nuclear explosive tests if the U.S. were to do so first.",
      "One year ago, Putin approved changes to Russia's official nuclear doctrine, formally amending the conditions \u2014 and lowering the threshold \u2014 under which Moscow would consider using its nuclear weapons.",
      "The updated doctrine, which was announced just as Ukraine launched its first strike deeper into Russia with U.S.-supplied missiles, states that Russia will treat an attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a country with nuclear capabilities as a joint attack by both.",
      "That means in theory that any attack on Russia by a country that's part of a coalition could be seen as an attack by the entire group. Under the doctrine, Russia could theoretically consider any major attack on its territory, even with conventional weapons, by non-nuclear-armed Ukraine sufficient to trigger a nuclear response, because Ukraine is backed by the nuclear-armed United States.",
      "Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine multiple times since he ordered the full-scale invasion of the country on Feb. 24, 2022, and Russia has repeatedly warned the West that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire Western-made missiles deep into its territory, it would consider the U.S. and its NATO allies to be directly involved in the war.",
      "Mr. Trump has so far declined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's repeated requests for U.S.-made Tomahawk long-range missiles.",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "Mr. Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plan to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal includes conducting actual atomic explosions, which have not been carried out in the U.S. for over 30 years, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine will not run for reelection next year, he announced Wednesday, a move that could complicate Democrats' efforts to win a House majority.",
      "Golden's district \u2014 which covers northern Maine \u2014 is expected to be one of the most closely contested House seats in next year's midterm elections. Last year, it was one of just 13 Democratic districts where a Democrat won the House race but President Trump won at the top of the ticket. It's one of 26 seats that the House GOP's campaign arm plans on targeting next year as Republicans aim to hold onto their narrow majority in the lower chamber.",
      "Golden is known for occasionally breaking with his party. He was the only House Democrat to vote in favor of GOP-backed measures to avert a government shutdown\u00a0in March\u00a0and in September. The latter measure failed to secure enough support from Senate Democrats to pass, prompting what is now the longest government shutdown in modern U.S. history. Golden also supports tariffs, a core component of Mr. Trump's trade strategy.",
      "Golden faced a primary challenge from Maine state Auditor Matt Dunlap, who has repeatedly accused him of \"caving\" to Mr. Trump. Former Gov. Paul LePage is running as a Republican in the 2nd Congressional District.",
      "In an op-ed in the Bangor Daily News, Golden said his decision was driven in part by the \"unnecessary, harmful\" government shutdown. He also said he has \"grown tired of the increasing incivility and plain nastiness that are now common from some elements of our American community,\" and \"recent incidents of political violence have made me reassess the frequent threats against me and my family.\"",
      "\"I don't fear losing. What has become apparent to me is that I now dread the prospect of winning. Simply put, what I could accomplish in this increasingly unproductive Congress pales in comparison to what I could do in that time as a husband, a father and a son,\" he wrote.",
      "First elected in 2018, Golden won reelection last year by 0.6 percentage points, or just under 3,000 votes. In the same year, Mr. Trump won in Golden's district by about 9 points.",
      "The National Republican Congressional Committee reacted to Golden's decision by expressing confidence that the seat will fall into GOP hands next year.",
      "\"Serial flip-flopper Jared Golden's exit from Congress says it all: He's turned his back on Mainers for years and now his chickens are coming home to roost,\" NRCC spokeswoman Maureen O'Toole. \"He, nor any other Democrat, has a path to victory in ME-02 and Republicans will flip this seat red in 2026.\"",
      "In a statement, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wished Golden well.",
      "\"Last night's election results make clear that voters are ready to elect a Democratic majority that keeps its promise to lower costs and fight for everyday people,\" Chair Suzan DelBene said, referring to elections in several states. \"Democrats will do everything necessary to keep this seat blue so that Mainers continue to have a voice fighting for them in Congress - and we are confident we will be successful.\"",

      "Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick in Alexandria, Virginia, also ordered the Justice Department to turn over all grand jury evidence and other materials to Comey's legal team by close of business Thursday, underlining his apparent criticism of federal prosecutors's actions in the case.",
      "Comey was indicted last month after public pressure from President Trump on Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department, and is charged with one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave almost five years ago pertaining to whether or not Comey had authorized leaks to the media during his time as FBI director.",
      "The two-page indictment accuses the former FBI director of falsely telling lawmakers that he never gave anybody at the FBI permission to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton. That alleged anonymous source is Daniel Richman, a longtime friend of Comey's and a Columbia University law professor. Richman's name did not come up in the Senate testimony that led to charges against Comey.",
      "The evidence at issue Wednesday is troves of data that the Justice Department gathered between 2019 and 2020 in a past Justice Department investigation during the first Trump administration known as \"Arctic Haze.\"",
      "The investigation, detailed in a memo declassified by the bureau earlier this year, sought to figure out how classified details on the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server made their way into a 2017 New York Times article, which looked at Comey's decision-making while leading the politically fraught probe. No one was charged in the investigation.",
      "One of Comey's attorneys, Rebekah Donaleski, said there are four different warrants that were executed on Richman in the \"Arctic Haze\" investigation that she knows of and evidence returned from those seizures could be used as part of the Justice Department's case against Comey. She said nobody on Comey's legal team has been given access to that information yet, and they have not been able to screen that data, which includes hard drives and phone and email records, for potentially privileged information that could have been used in the indictment.",
      "Comey attended the hearing but did not speak.",
      "Nathaniel Lemons, a North Carolina based assistant U.S. attorney who was tapped to lead the prosecution in Virginia alongside Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, argued for the Justice Department on Wednesday.",
      "Lemons said the materials are \"isolated on a desk in FBI headquarters\" and that investigators were \"not going to touch this evidence until the court approves\" a plan for handling it.",
      "Fitzpatrick ordered the Justice Department to not look at the material themselves until the court resolves any potential privilege claims asserted by Comey and his legal team, and said that the Justice Department can use evidence it believes to not be privileged \"at their own risk.\"",
      "Donaleski said she is \"gravely concerned\" about the Justice Department's handling of the evidence, and said it is possible that the way information has been withheld in this case so far is unconstitutional and in violation of the Fourth Amendment.",
      "\"We're going to fix that, and we're going to fix that today,\" the judge said, adding that Comey's legal team is \"entitled to this information quickly.\"",
      "Patrick Fitzgerald, another attorney for Comey, said that they are working through massive amounts of evidence in the case, which includes classified information. Fitzgerald said he has not been able to access that classified information yet because he has faced delays in getting his security clearance approved.",

      "Affordability was a key issue for both candidates, and Sherrill said she plans to address high property taxes in the state.",
      "\"It's really breaking the back of too many families. So while this has been a high-cost state, and I've always been working hard to get rid of the state and local tax deduction cap, I will increase that first-time home buyers' program so people can get a foot in the door,\" Sherrill said.",

      "He was a factor for many voters in each of the places where exit polls were conducted: Virginia, New Jersey, New York City and California. And more said their vote in these races was to oppose him, than support him.",
      "These are historically Democrat-leaning places, and more voters here disapproved than approved of his overall job as president. They also found that his administration's actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far.",
      "New York City: Cost of living and bringing needed change",
      "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani won a decisive victory over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on a campaign of affordability, and the cost of living was the most important issue to voters in New York City. Mamdani handily won the majority of voters who picked it. More specifically, he focused on the cost of housing, which seven in 10 voters in New York said was a major problem where they live, and he won among renters, who made up more than half of the electorate.",
      "Voters who made up their minds in the last month of the campaign voted overwhelmingly for Cuomo, but it wasn't enough to make up for the majority of voters who decided on Mamdani before October.",
      "Cuomo led Mamdani among Jewish voters \u2014 most of whom said a candidate's position on Israel was important in their vote.",
      "Mamdani's coalition was led by enormous support among voters under 30 and very liberal voters, but his support extended to all voters under 45 and to those who considered themselves only somewhat liberal, while older voters, as well as moderates and conservatives, voted for Cuomo.",
      "The Republican candidate in the New York City mayoral race, Curtis Sliwa, came in a distant third and didn't even win self-identified Republicans (they voted for Cuomo). Had he dropped out of the race, it might not have made a difference. Though most of Sliwa's supporters said they would have voted for Cuomo, exit polls indicate that in a hypothetical two-way race, Mamdani still would have been victorious.",
      "Mamdani also ran on change, and that was picked as the most important quality in how voters made their decision. A changing electorate was also a hallmark of Mamdani's win \u2014 his strongest support was not just young voters, but also those who were voting in a mayoral race for the first time and those who had moved to New York within the past 10 years.",
      "New Jersey and Virginia: The economy, women voters",
      "Economic issues also loomed large in the Democratic wins in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. In New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli won voters who were most concerned about taxes and who said electricity was a major problem for them, but voters who said the most important issue was the economy overall voted for Sherrill. In Virginia, those \"economy\" voters voted for Abigail Spanberger over Winsome Earle-Sears by more than 20 points.",
      "Women voted in big numbers for the women Democratic candidates in Virginia and New Jersey. Sherrill and Spanberger's margins with women were far larger than Kamala Harris' were nationally in 2024.",
      "Independents were key, too. They swung toward Spanberger in Virginia, after Glenn Youngkin won them in 2021. Independents also backed Sherrill in New Jersey.",
      "California Prop 50: Getting back at Republicans' plans",
      "The proposition, pushed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, authorizes temporary changes to the state's congressional district maps in response to redistricting in Texas.",
      "\"Yes\" voters didn't necessarily think this ballot initiative was the best way to draw congressional district line \u2014 but they overwhelmingly said it was to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states.",
      "Polls may have updated since this post was published.",
      "This polling is conducted by\u00a0SSRS, an independent research company, on behalf of ABC, the Associated Press (AP), CBS, CNN, Fox News, and NBC. It combines data collected from verified registered voters online and by telephone, with data collected in-person from voters on Election Day.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Zohran Mamdani's win in New York City's mayoral race has ignited passions for and against him, from pride in his birthplace of Uganda and applause from his counterpart in London to anger from Israel's top diplomat in the U.S.",
      "Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist who will be the city's first Muslim mayor, and his victory left some people in Africa beaming with pride for a hometown son. Mamdani was born in the East African nation of Uganda 34 years ago, then lived in South Africa for two years before moving with his family to New York as a child.",
      "\"What a moment! It was beautiful! I am excited!\" cheered Joseph Beyanga, CEO of Uganda's National Association of Broadcasters, pumping his hands in the air as he spoke with CBS News.",
      "Beyanga said he was Mamdani's mentor when the now-mayor-elect interned at one of Uganda's top newspapers, the Daily Monitor, during a vacation when he was in high school.",
      "\"Whatever he wanted to do, there was no middle point. Always he wanted the top,\" recalled Beyanga. \"Then I realized he was not just interested in current affairs. He was interested in how the current affairs affect the people. If you're talking about big money, the budget and all that, how does this affect the last person \u2026 he was interested in how it affects the people.\"",
      "\"When it was time to interact with people, he talked to people looking straight in the eye,\" he said.",
      "Beyanga added that even 17 years after he met Mamdani, he still sees the same person in the New York City politician.",
      "\"Nothing has changed. His heart is with the people, and I don't think that will change,\" he said. \"I've seen other outlets calling him populist and opponents giving him all sorts of names. I see a man after the heart of serving people, serving the down-trodden people in society. And hey, that doesn't come far away from who he is. He is a Ugandan boy, and the Ugandan boy cares for the people.\"",
      "Beyanga compared excitement in Uganda now to the exuberance among many Kenyans and Indonesians when former President Barack Obama was first elected.",
      "\"The Ugandans are having their Mamdani moment,\" Beyanga told CBS News, \"and yes, we say if he did it, yes we can!\"",
      "In the United Kingdom, London Mayor Sadiq Khan \u2014 who became the British capital's first Muslim leader when he was first elected in 2016 \u2014 voiced solidarity with his new counterpart. Khan is currently serving his third consecutive term.",
      "\"New Yorkers faced a clear choice \u2014 between hope and fear \u2014 and just like we've seen in London \u2014 hope won,\" Khan said in a social media post. \"Huge congratulations to Zohran Mamdani on his historic campaign.\"",
      "Following Mamdani's election win, Time magazine published an article by Khan, who called it \"extraordinary\" that two of the world's most influential cities will be led by people of the same faith.",
      "\"But \u2014 in two of the most diverse cities on Earth \u2014 it's a bit beside the point,\" Khan said. \"We did not win because of our faith. We won because we addressed voters' concerns, rather than playing on them.\"",
      "\"Mayor Mamdani and I might not agree on everything. Many of the challenges our cities face are similar, but they are not identical. Put policy differences aside, though, and it's clear that we are united by something far more fundamental: our belief in the power of politics to change people's lives for the better.\"",
      "Mamdani, a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights, has been accused of antisemitism and being pro-Hamas, which he denies.",
      "He has also been called out for refusing to condemn the phrase \"globalize the intifada.\" Intifada is an Arabic word that means uprising, but which is widely viewed as a slogan inciting violence against Israel. However, during his campaign he said he would \"discourage\" others from using the phrase and that it \"is not language that I use.\"",
      "\"Mamdani's inflammatory remarks will not deter us,\" Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Dannon said in a social media post on Wednesday. \"The Jewish community in New York and across the United States deserves safety and respect. We will continue to strengthen our ties with Jewish community leaders to ensure their security and well-being.\"",
      "CBS News' team in Israel said domestic media reports and editorials covering Mamdani's win were largely split along ideological lines. Left-wing commentary generally called for Mamdani to be given a chance, while more right-wing outlets leaned the other way.",
      "On Wednesday morning, the Times of Israel's front-page headline read: \"Far-left, anti-Israel candidate Zohran Mamdani wins New York City mayoral race.\"",
      "The Jerusalem Post's top featured editorial said: \"Mamdani winning in NY means antisemitism can win elections, would impact Jews globally.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 11:48:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Democrats are set to sweep Tuesday's gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, with Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger projected to win.",
    "story": [
      "Democrats swept Tuesday's gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, as the national party \u2014 still facing internal battles about its future \u2014 seeks to recover from last year's losses to President Trump.",
      "Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill is projected to defeat Republican former legislator Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey, and Democratic former Rep. Abigail Spanberger is projected to overcome Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia.",
      "The results mark a turnaround for Democrats in two states where the party has faced setbacks in recent years \u2014 especially during last year's presidential race, when Mr. Trump significantly boosted his share of the vote in normally blue-leaning New Jersey and Virginia, and the 2021 races, when Republicans reversed years of Democratic gains at the governor's mansion.",
      "The races could also serve as an early rebuke to Mr. Trump, albeit in two states that have never backed him outright. Spanberger and Sherrill ran hard against the president, who is unpopular in their respective states.",
      "And both Democratic campaigns \u2014 along with those of their GOP opponents \u2014 focused on economic concerns,\u00a0 an issue both parties have struggled with. Nationwide, most voters disapprove of the president's handling of the economy and worry that inflation will increase, though only 28% think Democrats have a better approach to economic policy than Mr. Trump and the GOP, according to a CBS News poll from last week.",
      "Still unresolved, however, is a longstanding internal dispute over whether the Democratic Party should embrace a progressive platform or move in a more moderate direction. Sherrill and Spanberger hail from the party's moderate wing. But on the same night as their victories, the New York City mayoral race went to Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who campaigned on rent freezes and city-owned grocery stores.",
      "Sherrill wins in New Jersey after Trump showed strength last year",
      "The victory by Sherrill, a four-term House member and former Navy pilot, follows two unexpectedly close races for New Jersey Democrats.",
      "One year ago, the state faced its tightest presidential contest since 1992. Mr. Trump lost the Garden State by just 5.9 percentage points in 2024, compared to 15.8-point and 14.1-point losses in prior times Mr. Trump was on the ballot.",
      "And in 2021, incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy defeated Ciattarelli by just 3 points, after Murphy won with a more than 14-point edge in 2017.",
      "While New Jersey hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988, the governor's office has darted between the two parties for decades. This year marks the first time since the 1960s when a single party has won three New Jersey gubernatorial races in a row.",
      "Both candidates spoke extensively about the cost of living, with Ciattarelli promising to \"Make New Jersey Affordable Again\" and Sherrill touting an \"Affordability Agenda.\"",
      "Sherrill frequently sought to link Ciattarelli to Mr. Trump and argued he would not stand up to the president, who enthusiastically endorsed the former state legislator, while Ciattarelli accused Democratic politicians like Murphy of mismanaging the state.",
      "Both Murphy and Mr. Trump are unpopular in New Jersey, with the governor's favorability (45%) fairly similar to the president's (44%), according to exit poll data.",
      "The race grew increasingly bitter in its closing weeks, with both campaigns tossing legal threats. CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records \u2014 including her Social Security number \u2014 to a Ciattarelli ally. And Ciattarelli threatened to sue Sherrill for defamation after she attacked him for alleged links to the opioid industry and claimed he \"went on to kill tens of thousands of people.\"",
      "Spanberger wins in Virginia after DOGE-dominated race",
      "Spanberger, a former House member and CIA officer, also tried to tie her opponent to Mr. Trump and railed against the administration's cuts to the federal workforce \u2014 a potent line of attack in Virginia, which has about 150,000 federal government jobs.",
      "Unlike in the New Jersey race, Mr. Trump did not endorse Earle-Sears for governor outright, although he appeared a telerally on Monday for the Republican ticket and he has penned Truth Social posts generically encouraging people to vote for the Republican candidates in Virginia.",
      "\"YOU WILL RUE THE DAY THAT YOU VOTED TO DESTROY YOUR LIFE,\" he wrote in a message Monday warning voters not to back Democrats.",
      "The state's gubernatorial races almost always go to the party that doesn't control the White House, and are often treated as referenda on the president. Mr. Trump's approval rating in Virginia stands at 42%, with 55% disapproving, according to exit poll data.",
      "Virginia used to be reliably red at the national level but has shifted leftward in recent years, backing Democrats in every presidential race since 2008 after voting for Republicans in the nine races before that. Democrats faced some slippage last year: Mr. Trump lost in the state by 5.7 points last year, compared to a 10.1-point loss in 2020.",
      "Spanberger sought to brand herself as a moderate, campaigning for part of the closing stretch with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a fellow moderate, and touting endorsements from two former Republican lawmakers.",
      "Meanwhile, Earle-Sears tried to follow Gov. Glenn Youngkin's strategy in 2021 and capitalize on some of the more polarizing parts of the Democratic agenda, attacking Spanberger on immigration enforcement and transgender issues. \"Spanberger is for they/them, not us,\" said one Earle-Sears ad that closely mirrored one of last year's best-known pro-Trump advertisements.",
      "Earle-Sears also railed against Spanberger over Democratic Attorney General candidate Jay Jones, who sent violent and incendiary texts about Virginia Republicans.",

    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist state assemblyman from Queens, will be New York City's 111th mayor.",
    "story": [
      "Zohran Mamdani will be New York City's 111th mayor, CBS News projects, capping a closely watched campaign in which the little-known state assemblyman energized voters with his focus on making America's largest city more affordable.",
      "The 34-year-old democratic socialist defeated Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent after losing a Democratic primary that he had initially entered as the clear front-runner. The mayoral race drew the attention of President Trump, who endorsed Cuomo the night before the election and threatened to withhold federal funds to New York City under a Mayor Mamdani.",
      "Mamdani's message centered around the cost of living, energizing a coalition of young and progressive voters, even as critics questioned his lack of experience and raised concerns about his stance on Israel. He pledged to freeze rents on rent-stabilized apartments and raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for a host of new services, like free buses and city-run grocery stores.",
      "When he assumes office, Mamdani will make history as the city's first Muslim mayor. At 34, he'll also be one of the city's youngest mayors, but not the youngest ever: That distinction belongs to Hugh J. Grant, who was 31 when he was elected to his first term in 1889.",
      "Click here for complete New York City election results.",
      "Mamdani promises \"relentless improvement\"",
      "Mamdani promised to bring New York City into an age of \"relentless improvement\" as he claimed victory in the mayoral race late Tuesday night.",
      "He said his win was one for the working people of New York and reiterated his campaign promises on affordability.",
      "\"Let the words we've spoken together, the dreams we've dreamt together become the agenda we deliver together,\" Mamdani said. \"New York, this power, it's yours. This city belongs to you. Thank you.\"",
      "Mamdani's background",
      "Mamdani was born in Uganda and moved to New York City when he was 7. He attended the elite Bronx High School of Science before heading off to Bowdoin College.",
      "In 2018, he became an American citizen.",
      "His parents are political science professor Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair. Mamdani is married to artist Rama Duawaji. They live in Queens, where Mamdani has served as state assemblyman since 2021, representing Astoria, Astoria Heights and Ditmars-Steinway in Queens.",
      "Mamdani's policies",
      "Mamdani focused his campaign around reducing the cost of living. He promised to freeze the rent for\u00a0the city's rent-stabilized units. He has also pledged to provide\u00a0free bus service\u00a0and to open city-owned grocery stores in each borough. Mamdani also says he wants to build 200,000 affordable housing units.",
      "To pay for his proposals, Mamdani has said he would raise taxes on corporations and on top earners by 2%, but he'll need the help of Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state legislature to do it.",
      "His candidacy was enthusiastically embraced by prominent fellow progressives like\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0and\u00a0Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He eventually got the endorsement of some top Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and\u00a0Hochul.",
      "Mamdani's position on Israel\u00a0drew scrutiny over the course of the campaign. He condemned\u00a0the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attacks\u00a0on Israel, but also criticized the Israeli government's response, calling the war in Gaza a genocide. Israel said his comments were \"shameful.\"",
      "Mamdani says, while he supports Israel's right to exist,\u00a0he will not say it should exist as a Jewish state.",
      "\"I would not recognize any state's right to exist with a system of hierarchy on the basis of race or religion,\" he said in the candidates' second and final debate.",
      "He also said critics have wrongly accused him of more extreme statements.",
      "\"I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad. That is not something that I have said. And that continues to be ascribed to me. And frankly, I think much of it has to do with that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election,\" Mamdani said during the last debate.",
      "Mamdani and the NYPD",
      "Mamdani came under withering criticism for his past remarks regarding the NYPD. He previously called for disbanding the Strategic Response Group, which was the same unit that responded to the Midtown office shooting in July. He has since walked that back, saying he was opposed to using that unit to respond to protests.",
      "\"I am not defunding the police,\" Mamdani said\u00a0this summer. \"I am not running to defund the police.\"",
      "In an\u00a0October interview with Fox News, Mamdani again apologized for remarks he made about the NYPD in 2020, when he called the department \"racist\" and a \"threat to public safety\" amid nationwide protests after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.",
      "\"We used to ask officers to focus on serious crimes. Now we're asking them to focus also on the mental health crisis, to focus also on homelessness,\" Mamdani said last month. \"Absolutely I'll apologize to police officers right here. Because this is the apology that I've been sharing with many rank and file officers. And I apologize because of the fact that I'm looking to work with these officers, and I know that these officers, these men and women who serve in the NYPD, they put their lives on the line every single day.\"",
      "Mamdani also recently said he would ask Jessica Tisch to stay on as police commissioner.",

    "summary": "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country that U.N. experts warn could be sliding \"back toward another deadly war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is planning to terminate Temporary Protected Status for nationals of South Sudan imminently, CBS News has exclusively learned. The change will end more than a decade of protection that allowed thousands of displaced South Sudanese nationals to live and work legally in the United States.",
      "According to DHS officials, the decision by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem came after consultation with the State Department and other federal agencies.",
      "Despite recent warnings from the United Nations and other organizations that South Sudan could actually be slipping back into a state of open warfare, DHS officials pointed to the end of an armed conflict, improved diplomatic relations and South Sudan's expressed commitment to reintegrating any returning nationals, adding that continuing the TPS designation for South Sudan would be \"contrary\" to U.S. interests.",
      "The designation lapsed on November 3, 2025, and a DHS official tells CBS News that a formal notice of termination will be published in the Federal Register later this week, triggering a 60-day grace period for South Sudanese nationals to depart the country or face deportation once their status officially expires in January. DHS estimates that roughly 5,000 South Sudanese nationals are currently living in the United States.",
      "Over the past 14 years, under the program, South Sudanese nationals who could not safely return to their home country due to armed conflict and environmental disaster were shielded from deportation and allowed to work legally in the U.S. The designation dated back to a period of rampant instability that began when the young nation first gained its independence in 2011. Multiple presidential administrations had since extended the program.",
      "South Sudan's TPS designation was most recently renewed for 18 months, from November 4, 2023, to May 3, 2025, by then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, \"due to ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in South Sudan that prevent individuals from safely returning.\" It was then extended automatically for six months, through November 3, after DHS did not complete a required review before a statutory 60-day window passed.",
      "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country still struggling to recover from years of civil war and humanitarian crises. While DHS says conditions have improved, humanitarian groups and regional experts caution that peace remains fragile, with deepening economic distress creating challenges for any safe return.",
      "U.N. says \"all indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war\"",
      "International mediators have reported some progress toward implementing a peace agreement and transitional governance framework, despite violence, corruption and weak state institutions hampering humanitarian access. But the U.S. State Department maintains a\u00a0Level 4 \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for South Sudan, citing persistent armed conflict, crime and kidnapping.",
      "According to the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations, armed clashes among government troops, opposition forces and ethnic militias continue to claim lives and displace civilians.",
      "The United Nations has documented widespread human rights abuses, including the\u00a0recruitment of child soldiers, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions, and the global body's human rights chief warned as recently as September that the fragile truce could crumble.",
      "\"With fears of a collapse of the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement and a return to widespread violence intensifying, I deeply worry for the plight of civilians in South Sudan,\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in late September.",
      "More recently, a U.N. commission on human rights in the country warned the U.N. General Assembly at the end of October that \"South Sudan's political transition is falling apart.\"",
      "\"The ceasefire is not holding, political detentions have become a tool of repression, the peace agreement's key provisions are being systematically violated, and the Government forces are using aerial bombardments in civilian areas. All indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war,\" commissioner Barney Afako told the U.N.",
      "The U.N.'s\u00a0World Food Program\u00a0has also warned that ongoing conflict, flooding and food insecurity are worsening humanitarian conditions in the country.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the population \u2014 an estimated 9 million people \u2014 require humanitarian assistance, while 7.7 million face acute food insecurity, according to the Congressional Research Service and the\u00a0U.N. Population Fund.",
      "In the run-up to the official termination, DHS is now urging South Sudanese nationals who choose to depart voluntarily to use the Customs and Border Protection \"CBP Home\" mobile app to report their departure. The app, according to the department, offers a \"safe, secure\" way to self-deport, including a complimentary plane ticket, an exit bonus of $1,000 and potential pathways for future legal immigration to the United States, although DHS has not outlined what those pathways might look like.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 23:56:39 -0500",
    "summary": "A Democratic Socialists of America leader says New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani offers a \"powerful way forward\" for Democrats \u2014 but some moderates worry he'll hand the GOP \"a pretty potent set of weapons\" in next year's midterms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory on Tuesday in the New York City mayoral race is already fanning the debate about the future of the Democratic Party and what his sudden political stardom could mean for next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"We hope this is demonstrating a very powerful way forward,\" said Ashik Siddique, a national co-chair of the Democratic Socialists of America. \"This election proves that democratic socialist ideas are very popular.\"",
      "Mamdani ran on promises to confront economic inequality and cost-of-living issues, vowing rent freezes for residents of rent-stabilized units, affordable housing construction, free \u2014 and faster \u2014 bus service, free childcare, city-owned grocery stores to address high food costs and tax hikes on the wealthy.",
      "His victory is the biggest win for progressives since Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated 10-term incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in 2018. But history suggests his success isn't likely to translate to a progressive sweep nationwide.",
      "\"It's very reminiscent of 2018 when you had this superstar, young, telegenic and extremely capable candidate win a primary in New York City and set the world on fire,\" said Matt Bennett, the executive vice president for public affairs for moderate Democratic group Third Way. \"But in the end, the thing that really mattered was that 40 seats were flipped, and Nancy Pelosi got the gavel \u2014 and those seats were flipped by moderates.\"",
      "\"Much ink will be spilled over Mamdani, and he will become a face to the party, but the idea that he will define what it means to be a Democrat, I think, is absurd,\" Bennett said.",
      "Some in the Democratic Party who have been critical of Mamdani rallied behind Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York, who ran as an independent after his defeat by Mamdani in the Democratic primary. Cuomo, the son of liberal icon and former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, was endorsed by the current scandal-ridden New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped his reelection bid, and President Trump.",
      "In the 2024 primary elections, \"mainstream\" Democrats outperformed progressive candidates, winning about two-thirds of the races, according to a study from the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The study also noted just three House candidates and one Senate candidate who identify as democratic socialists won their elections in 2024.",
      "A CBS News poll conducted last week found that just 22% of Democrats nationwide think the party should move toward socialist positions. A majority \u2014 60% of Democrats nationwide \u2014 said their party's economic positions should reflect a mixture of socialist and capitalist ideas. And 5% said the party should move more toward capitalist positions.",
      "Establishment Democratic leaders have mostly offered tepid endorsements of Mamdani, or none at all, and moderate Democrats have been trying to distance themselves from his proposals.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, was slow to endorse Mamdani, offering his backing to the candidate in late October, only a day before early voting began. Neither of the state's Democratic senators, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, gave their endorsement. Former President Barack Obama called Mamdani the weekend before the election, but he stopped short of offering public support.",
      "Jeffries told CNN in an interview Sunday that he does not view Mamdani as the future of the party and is not concerned about Republicans using him as a \"lightning rod\" against Democrats in the elections next November.",
      "That won't stop Republicans from asserting that Mamdani is the new face of the Democratic Party. They're doing it already. The National Republican Campaign Committee, the House GOP's fundraising arm, has been linking Mamdani to vulnerable Democrats in New York, as well as party leaders.",
      "\"The Democrat Party has surrendered to radical socialist Zohran Mamdani and the far-left mob who are now running the show,\" NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement Tuesday. \"Every House Democrat is foolishly complicit in their party's collapse, and voters will make them pay in 2026.\"",
      "Bennett said Mamdani's win and the Democratic Socialists of America platform gives Republicans \"a pretty potent set of weapons\" to use against Democrats running in Republican strongholds and battleground states or districts. He compared it to Republican attack ads against Democrats during the \"defund the police\" movement which gained prominence after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.",
      "\"It raises the level of difficulty to flip places from red to blue,\" Bennett said. \"What we have learned, and we especially learned from the 'defund the police' experience, is that silence is deadly. So Democrats cannot simply presume that their reputation, their brand, the fact that they are local in Wisconsin or Michigan or wherever they're running is going to be enough to convince people that they don't share the Mamdani ideas the Republicans suggest that they do.\"",
      "Also unclear: Whether New York Democrats will help or hinder Mamdani as he tries to implement his far-reaching agenda. He'll need authorization from New York state agencies for proposals like free bus service, and Democrats in Albany will need to greenlight some of the tax increases on high earners that he's proposed in order to pay for his plans.",
      "\"While there is some low-hanging fruit, we believe that many initiatives are not viable in their current form,\" J.P. Morgan Asset Management said in a report on Mamdani's platform last month that argued state lawmakers are unlikely to let him hike taxes on corporations and residents who make over $1 million.",
      "Still, Bennett said there are lessons that Democratic candidates can learn from Mamdani, the most important being his \"crystal clear\" focus on affordability.",
      "\"I don't particularly like his ideas, but he articulated them in ways that really resonated and that people could kind of repeat back to him, and that's a very good lesson for Democrats to take,\" he said.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who also describes himself as a democratic socialist, told CBS News' \"The Takeout\": \"If he wins, the message goes all over this country: You can stand up to the oligarchs, we can start electing members of Congress and mayors and governors who stand with the working class.\"",

      "California's approval of Proposition 50 sets in motion a redistricting plan that could result in pickups of five seats for Democrats in the Golden State. It's an effort that may ripple beyond California's borders \u2014 here's an early look at some of Prop 50's potential effects, not all of which are related to redistricting:",
      "A win for Democrats",
      "Prop 50 victory, among other things, notches a badly needed win for Democrats in the redistricting battle kicked off by President Trump earlier this year.",
      "The president, seeking to gain up to five seats for Republicans to try to help them hold the House in the 2026 midterm elections, successfully urged Texas to undertake a mid-decade gerrymander. Newsom said he'd only go through with Prop 50 if Texas passed its new congressional map. In announcing the initiative, Newsom said Mr. Trump is \"trying to rig the system,\" adding \"we have got to meet fire with fire.\"",
      "New lines would be temporary",
      "The passage of the ballot measure, pending legal action, will result in a map drawn by California Democrats that takes five Republican congressional districts and makes them more favorable to Democrats. But it would only be used for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.",
      "After the 2030 U.S. Census, according to Prop 50, the gerrymandered maps would only be used until the nonpartisan California Citizens Redistricting Commission draws new congressional maps.",
      "Newer maps that squeeze majority's opponents across the country",
      "More and more states have begun trying to squeeze partisan minorities further through redistricting before next year's midterms. A CBS News poll in October found that among voters who plan to support Proposition 50, one reason they're doing so is to oppose the Trump administration \u2014 which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states \u2014 and to oppose national Republicans.",
      "California's decision to redraw its maps has already begun to exert pressure on more GOP-led states to launch their own redistricting gambits. Besides Texas, lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina have passed new maps in recent months that shift one district apiece toward Republicans, and Ohio is considering new maps.",
      "Republicans in Indiana signaled last month that they didn't have the votes to redraw their maps, but after weeks of pressure from Mr. Trump, GOP Gov. Mike Braun called the legislature into a special session to consider redistricting.",
      "And in Maryland, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore has just announced the creation of a redistricting commission to consider mid-decade redistricting.",
      "\"We will explore every avenue possible to make sure Maryland has fair and representative maps,\" Moore said in a statement. But Maryland state Senate president Bill Ferguson, also a Democrat, believes mid-cycle redistricting in Maryland \"is the wrong path for our State,\" he said on X. He warned of legal barriers to redistricting that could result in ceding \"one or two congressional seats to Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"There's fighting fire with fire, and then there's unintentionally burning your own house down in the process,\" Ferguson said.",
      "Platform for Newsom's political future?",
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become one of Mr. Trump's highest-profile adversaries, was the architect of California's mid-decade redistricting effort and fought for the Prop 50 initiative. His push for Prop 50 may for a time have been the most public example of resistance by Democrats against Mr. Trump.",
      "Newsom has not ruled out a run for the presidency in 2028, and his success in selling Prop 50 to voters could help launch a campaign, especially if Democrats are able to take the House in 2026. And he indicated to Robert Costa in a late October interview on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" that he'll give serious thought to running after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Voters in Tuesday's race were divided on whether Newsom should run for president in 2028, with 45% saying he should and 54% saying he shouldn't, according to exit polling data.",

    "story": [
      "Democrat Jay Jones will win the Virginia attorney general's race, CBS News projects, surviving a scandal that arose late in the race over violent text messages he had written in 2022 about a Republican legislator.",
      "Jones defeated GOP incumbent Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, who had tried to seize on the resurfaced text messages to portray him as unfit for the office. But Miyares, who was backed by President Trump, was confronted by the headwinds of the federal shutdown and the president's government cuts in a state with high numbers of government workers \u2014 over 147,000 \u2014 according to Office of Personnel Management data.",
      "In his sole debate against Miyares, Jones apologized multiple times for the texts, but maintained Miyares' connections to Mr. Trump were worse.",
      "Jones resisted calls from Republicans to drop out after the text message scandal.",
      "Although Jones was denounced by the Democrats' nominee for governor, Abigail Spanberger, who also won on Tuesday night, over the text messages, he was part of the Democrats' closing rally over the weekend with former President Barack Obama.",
      "In the text messages, Jones wrote that he would \"piss on graves\" of GOP opponents and mused about a fantasy hypothetical shooting of Republican Todd Gilbert, who was then speaker of the House of Delegates. In a statement to CBS News at the time, Jones said he took full responsibility for his actions and apologized for the texts.",
      "Jones had been leading the race according to a Washington Post poll in early October, but before the poll was released, the text messages resurfaced.",
      "Miyares had seized on the texts, too, running ads saying, \"Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?\"",
      "Miyares was elected in 2021 as part of the red wave in Virginia that swept Gov. Glenn Youngkin into office. As attorney general, Miyares brought lawsuits\u00a0 against the Biden administration, but has so far only joined one lawsuit against the Trump administration. Jones during the primary campaign vowed he'd sue the Trump administration \"into oblivion\" on his first day in office.",
      "Before the text message scandal, Miyares emphasized\u00a0 a tough-on-crime message, criticizing Jones, who served in the House of Delegates from 2018 to 2022, for votes he had cast for criminal justice reform. Jones said at the October debate that he'd prioritize protecting civil rights and Virginia communities, and also touted a three-point public safety plan, which he said was created with the input of state and local law enforcement officials.",

      "Spanberger will be Virginia's first female governor.",
      "Virginia's off-year gubernatorial race tends to serve as a referendum on the president who was elected a year prior \u2014 and historically, the president's party has almost always lost.",
      "National politics were a throughline in this year's race, especially the Trump administration's sweeping federal layoffs and the still-unresolved month-long government shutdown, which has forced most federal workers to go without pay. Both issues are potent in Virginia, which has nearly 150,000 federal civilian jobs and is home to scores of military personnel.",
      "Spanberger, a former CIA officer and congresswoman, positioned herself as an adversary of the Trump administration and sought to link Earle-Sears to Mr. Trump. She frequently tried to capitalize on frustration over federal layoffs and Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Virginia has moved leftward in recent years, driven by shifts in the fast-growing suburbs of Washington, D.C., though Democrats lost ground last year, with Mr. Trump boosting his share of the statewide vote from 44% in 2020 to 46.1% in 2024.",
      "A year later, however, the president's approval rating in Virginia stands at 42%, with 55% disapproving, according to exit poll data \u2014 a possible liability for Republicans.",
      "But the race also follows months of uncertainty for the Democratic Party, which was stung by its 2024 loss and is still riven by disagreements between its moderate and progressive factions on the party's strategy moving forward. Meanwhile, just 34% of U.S. adults hold a favorable view of the party, compared to 41% for the GOP, according to a CBS News poll from last month.",
      "Earle-Sears, a Marine Corps veteran and former state lawmaker, took aim at Spanberger over immigration and the participation of transgender students in school sports.",
      "In recent weeks, the race has been dominated by a scandal in the usually lower-profile Virginia attorney general election, after text messages surfaced showing Democratic nominee Jay Jones used violent and incendiary language toward Republicans. Spanberger condemned the messages, but Earle-Sears pressed her to call for Jones to drop out of the race.",
      "Spanberger campaigned in the closing stretch with high-profile Democrats like former President Barack Obama, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.",
      "Earle-Sears drew on support from Virginia's popular but term-limited incumbent Gov. Glenn Youngkin, whose economic record Earle-Sears has touted.",
      "But the Republican candidate wasn't explicitly endorsed by Mr. Trump, the leader of her party, even though the president gave his \"complete and total endorsement\" to the GOP nominees in Virginia's attorney general race and New Jersey's gubernatorial race. Mr. Trump has offered some support for Earle-Sears \u2014 but not by name.",
      "\"I think the Republican candidate is very good, and I think she should win because the Democrat candidate's a disaster,\" he told reporters two weeks ago, adding, \"I haven't been too much involved in Virginia.\"",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down\u00a0on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding. Some 35 days later, it surpassed the record for longest shutdown on record.",
      "Republicans have rejected Democrats' push to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018 and early 2019, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",

House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency may need to close \"certain parts\" of the nation's airspace if the shutdown drags on.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation may need to close \"certain parts of the airspace\" if the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on record continues into next week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" Duffy said at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",
      "He added, \"We will restrict the airspace when we feel it's not safe.\"",
      "Throughout the 35-day federal shutdown, set to become the longest in U.S. history, Duffy has maintained that commercial air travel remains safe. The tradeoff is that passengers are experiencing more flight delays as officials slow flight traffic based on staffing levels to ensure that the national airspace remains well-monitored, Duffy\u00a0has said at earlier press conferences.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while an additional 4,700 trips were delayed on Monday, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "Duffy said on social media on Wednesday that 46% of the previous day's flight delays were due to staffing issues in air traffic control towers. Ordinarily, personnel issues account for roughly 5% of such delays, according to aviation data.",
      "\"Draconian steps\"?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights following the\u00a09/11 terror attacks for national security reasons, while hurricanes and other weather emergencies can also lead to flight restrictions. But closing parts of the nation's airspace because of staffing issues would be unprecedented, according to aviation industry experts.",
      "\"In this particular instance, Duffy is talking about staffing. He knows the strain and stress this is taking on air traffic controllers,\" Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and an expert on aviation security, told CBS News.",
      "Closing even a portion of the nation's vast airspace would be a major step and likely impact travel nationwide, he added. The system operates on a so-called hub-and-spoke model in which passengers using regional airports can connect with major airports to travel around the U.S.",
      "If the airspace around New York were to close, for example, it could affect passengers in multiple cities, according to Jacobson.",
      "\"For us to take such draconian steps to shut it down in sectors of the country would be unprecedented,\" he said. \"If you shut down the New York area, you shut down a lot of the country because of the interconnectivity of the hub-and-spoke system.\"",
      "More controllers calling in sick",
      "With air traffic controllers working without pay during the shutdown, more than usual are calling in sick, Duffy has said. He has said he is discouraging them from taking on side gigs like delivering for Uber or DoorDash to make ends meet during the funding lapse, given the level of focus that their job requires.",
      "\"The longer this goes on, every day, these hardworking Americans have bills they have to pay, and they're being forced to make decisions and choices,\" Duffy said Tuesday. \"As every day goes by, I think the problem is going to only get worse. Not better.\"",
      "At an Oct. 28 news conference at LaGuardia Airport in New York, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels emphasized that his organization's members are under mounting financial pressures.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "The U.S. Travel Association on Monday urged congressional leaders to end the shutdown, which the industry trade group said could disrupt passengers during the busy Thanksgiving holiday. In 2024, 20 million passengers took to the skies over that week.",
      "\"A shutdown places extraordinary strain on federal personnel who are essential to keeping America moving \u2014 from Transportation Security Administration officers to air traffic controllers, who are forced to work without pay,\" the group said in a Nov. 3 letter. \"When staffing shortages worsen, airport wait times grow longer and flight delays and cancellations become more frequent, threatening to derail family travel plans across the country.\"",

    "summary": "Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein provided the Justice Department with \"precise and detailed\" information about 20 alleged co-conspirators, House Democrats say.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, is seeking documents from the Justice Department on its move earlier this year to end the investigation into alleged co-conspirators of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"I write to demand an explanation for why DOJ has abandoned the women and girls abused by Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators, fired or cut off career prosecutors from the case, and ceased its investigation into one of the largest sex trafficking rings in history,\" Raskin wrote in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, which was first obtained by CBS News.",
      "The demand comes amid relentless bipartisan interest in the investigation, which has dogged the Justice Department's top officials as they've sought to put the matter to rest. Some in the Trump administration, including Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, promised major revelations into the Epstein matter before taking office, only to indicate later that the case was closed.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on Raskin's letter and will update this story with any response.",
      "In the letter, Raskin said almost 50 survivors provided information to prosecutors and FBI agents as part of the investigation that ultimately led to the indictments of Epstein in 2019 and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2020. Raskin said the information the survivors provided was \"precise and detailed.\"",
      "\"They described how Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators orchestrated a sophisticated and clandestine sex trafficking conspiracy that trafficked them to at least 20 men,\" Raskin said. \"These survivors shared with DOJ and FBI the specific identities of many of these co-conspirators, how this operation was structured and financed, and which individuals facilitated these crimes.\"",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York was running an active investigation into Epstein and Maxwell's co-conspirators until January 2025, when prosecutors were directed to transfer the Epstein case files to the Justice Department's headquarters, in what Raskin said was \"a sudden and dramatic shift in the posture of the investigation.\" Since then, \"the investigation into co-conspirators has inexplicably ceased,\" he said, citing information provided to the Judiciary Committee by attorneys who represent Epstein survivors.",
      "Then in July, the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review, which it said found no \"client list\" among the evidence collected by investigators. It also \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate any investigation against uncharged third parties.\" Bondi suggested during a Fox News interview in February that a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk awaiting her review.",
      "\"DOJ and FBI's failure to investigate this conduct is a betrayal of the more than 1,000 survivors of this multi-billion-dollar international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin wrote. \"As these survivors made clear to DOJ and FBI, Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell did not act alone.\"",
      "Raskin said many of the women spoke with prosecutors and agents, and the interviews were summarized in 302 forms, a document used by the FBI to memorialize information that may later come up in courtroom testimony. Along with the women, Raskin said federal law enforcement agents who worked on the case understood that the investigation was continuing up until January. In Supreme Court filings, Raskin pointed out, the government said the pursuit of Epstein's co-conspirators was ongoing during the Biden administration.",
      "Raskin said the committee is considering reforms that would clarify prosecutors' responsibility to communicate with crime survivors before investigations are closed. And he accused Patel of having \"repeatedly impugned the credibility of the Epstein survivors\" at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September by suggesting that the information provided by the survivors was not credible.",
      "During the hearing, Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has led an effort to force a vote in the House on releasing the Epstein files, pointed to 20 alleged co-conspirators.",
      "\"According to victims who cooperated with the FBI in that investigation, these documents in FBI possession, your possession, detail at least 20 men, including Mr. Jes Staley, CEO of Barclays Bank,\" Massie said, referring to a banker who left Barclays in 2021 amid scrutiny over his ties to Epstein. Staley, who worked with Epstein for years as a top official at J.P. Morgan, has said they had a \"close professional relationship.\" Staley has denied wrongdoing and said he regrets befriending Epstein.",
      "Massie said other high-profile figures were among those named by Epstein's victims.",
      "\"That list also includes at least 19 other individuals \u2014 one Hollywood producer worth a few hundred million dollars, one royal prince, one high-profile individual in the music industry, one very prominent banker, one high-profile government official, one high-profile former politician, one owner of a car company in Italy, one rockstar, one magician, at least six billionaires, including a billionaire from Canada,\" Massie said.",
      "Massie asked Patel if the FBI had launched any investigations into the individuals and whether he'd seen the 302 documents. Patel responded that he has asked FBI agents to \"review the entirety of the Epstein files and bring forth any credible information.\" He said \"any investigations that arise from any credible investigation will be brought,\" but he added that there have been \"no new materials brought to me launching a new indictment.\"",
      "Asked whether he was asserting that the victims' statements weren't credible, Patel said, \"It's not my assertion, sir, it's the assertion of two different United States attorneys' offices from three separate administrations who investigated those same materials in live time.\"",
      "Raskin said Patel's explanation, along with a later exchange with Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, was not good enough. He wrote in his letter that he is seeking \"an accounting\" of the steps the Justice Department has taken to review the case this year, relevant summaries or reports generated as part of that review and documents related to staffing for Epstein investigative matters.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has inexplicably killed this investigation,\" Raskin said.",

      "President Trump has decided once again to nominate Jared Isaacman to serve as his NASA administrator, he announced Tuesday evening, months after withdrawing the tech billionaire and private astronaut's nomination because of concerns about his political leanings.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Isaacman to the Senate-confirmed post last year, but announced in late May he had decided to withdraw Isaacman after a \"thorough review\" of his \"prior associations.\"",
      "Weeks after the withdrawal, the president went further in expressing his concerns about Isaacman's credentials. At the time, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he thought Isaacman \"was very good,\" but had been \"surprised to learn\" that Isaacman was a \"blue-blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.\"",
      "Federal Election Commission records\u00a0show\u00a0Isaacman has donated to Democratic congressional candidates and Democratic aligned groups, though he has also given some money to Republicans. Isaacman has\u00a0described himself\u00a0as \"relatively apolitical\" and a \"right-leaning moderate,\" and said he disclosed his political donations to Democrats prior to his nomination.",
      "Isaacman has had the endorsement of a powerful fellow tech entrepreneur, Mr. Trump's former adviser, Elon Musk. Isaacman, the CEO and founder of credit card-processing company Shift4, has been a close collaborator with Musk ever since buying his first chartered flight with Musk's company SpaceX. He bought a series of spaceflights from SpaceX, which has extensive contracts with NASA to transport astronauts and equipment.",
      "The president and Musk had a very public falling-out earlier this year, but are now on better terms. Last week, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Musk have spoken \"on and off\" since sitting together at conservative activist Charlie Kirk's funeral last month in Arizona and that their relationship is \"good.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested that he withdrew Isaacman's nomination in part because of his relationship with Musk, saying he \"thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life.\"",
      "Isaacman said on X he \"only know[s] Elon professionally\" and does not own any equity in SpaceX, but he has a \"firsthand appreciation for what he and his companies have accomplished.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made no mention of his previous decision to nominate and then withdraw Isaacman in his Tuesday evening announcement of the re-nomination on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\"This evening, I am pleased to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of NASA,\" Trump posted. \"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman thanked the president and the \"space-loving community\" Tuesday in a post on X, writing: \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been serving as interim NASA administrator. The president on Tuesday praised Duffy for doing an \"incredible job.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have spotted the brightest flare yet from a supermassive black hole that shines with the light of 10 trillion suns.",
      "These bursts of light and energy can come from things like tangled-up magnetic fields or hiccups in the heated gas disks surrounding black holes. The flares help illuminate researchers' understanding of the black holes within.",
      "The flare came from a supermassive black hole that's 10 billion light years away, making the flash the most distant one observed so far. It hails from a time when the universe was rather young. A light year is nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "The latest cosmic display was spotted in 2018 by a camera at the Palomar Observatory in California. It took about three months to shine at peak brightness and has been decaying in the years since.",
      "It likely happened because a large star wandered too close to the black hole and got shredded to pieces.",
      "\"At first, we didn't really believe the numbers about the energy,\" said study author Matthew Graham with the California Institute of Technology, which operates Palomar.",
      "The new findings were published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "Almost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its center. The immense pull of that black hole, which is surrounded by powerful magnetic fields, gives the Milky Way its characteristic swirl.",
      "Scientists still aren't sure how supermassive black holes form.",
      "Studying such behemoths can help researchers better understand the stellar neighborhood surrounding supermassive black holes. The discovery also allows scientists \"to probe the interaction of supermassive black holes with their environments early in the universe,\" said Joseph Michail with Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which didn't have a role in the new study. Those early interactions created the cosmos humans now call home.",
      "The oldest black hole yet discovered was spotted by scientists in March 2024. That supermassive black hole was formed when our 13.8 billion-year-old universe was just 430 million years old. The black hole is at the center of a distant galaxy and is vigorously growing, researchers said.",

    "story": [
      "Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center \u2014\u00a0China launched its Shenzhou-21 spacecraft on Friday, carrying a new three-person crew to man the country's Tiangong space station on a mission focused on scientific research. The replacement crew includes China's youngest-ever taikonaut \u2014 as China's space program calls its astronauts \u2014   and, for the first time since Beijing launched its program, it will also include live mammals.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 and its crew blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China atop a Long March-2F rocket just before midnight on Friday, or about 11 a.m. Eastern.",
      "The taikonauts on board \u2014 Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang \u2014 will rotate in so the trio currently on board the Chinese space station from the Shenzhou-20 mission, which launched on April 24, can come back home after their six-months in space. The exact date of their return has yet to be announced.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew are scheduled to conduct a total of 27 scientific and applied research projects during their mission, focusing on multiple fields including space life sciences, biotechnology, space medicine, space materials science, microgravity fluid physics and combustion and new space technologies, according to information provided by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).",
      "Along with the taikonauts, Shenzhou-21 is carrying four mice \u2014 two females and two males \u2014 the first live mammals ever carried by China into space. Two previous missions to the Tiangong station carried live fish.",
      "The taikonauts will study the effects of microgravity and confined space conditions on the behavioral patterns of mice.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew, with Lu as their commander are scheduled to live aboard the space station for approximately six months, just like the crew they are replacing.",
      "It won't be the first visit to the station for Lu, who previously served on the Shenzhou-15 mission.",
      "The other two crew members are making their first spaceflight, and Flight Engineer Wu, born in 1993, will be the youngest taikonaut ever sent into space by his nation.",
      "\"I feel incomparably lucky,\" he told reporters Thursday. \"Being able to integrate my personal dreams into the glorious journey of China's space program is the greatest fortune this era has bestowed upon me.\"",
      "Crowds gathered around the Jiuquan launch site on Friday ahead of the countdown, and a man who identified himself to CBS News only as Mr. Zhao said he was \"very excited\" to be there with his 7-year-old son, \"hoping to plant the seed of a space dream into his heart.\"",
      "China's growing \"space dream\"",
      "China has ramped up its space program unilaterally since being excluded from the International Space Station project \u2014   largely over the U.S. government's concerns about the Chinese military's full control over its program \u2014   to achieve its \"space dream\" under President Xi Jinping.",
      "It has manned the Tiangong station since 2021, and there are now plans to bring the first non-Chinese crewmember aboard the facility.",
      "China will arrange for one Pakistani national to undertake a short-term space mission in the future, the CMSA has said, following the signing of a cooperation agreement between the two countries in February.",
      "The process to select a Pakistani national for training has already begun, along with planning for training programs and to prepare logistical support for Pakistanis under consideration.",
      "Following the selection process, two Pakistani nationals will travel to China to train alongside Chinese taikonauts for future missions, the CMSA said.",
      "CMSA spokesperson Zhang Jingbo said during a news conference this week ahead of the Shenzhou-21 launch that China would welcome international partners to participate in missions aboard its space station.",
      "The work done on China's space station coincides with and often compliments the nation's efforts to be the first nation to land a person on the moon's surface in more than 40 years. Chinese officials have made it a public goal to land taikonauts on the moon's surface by 2030, and eventually to build a lunar base.",
      "China has already landed unmanned probes on the moon, including the first ever to land and collect samples from the celestial body's far side just last year.",
      "\"Overall, the research and construction has been running smoothly, with China aiming to achieve the goal of landing Chinese astronauts on the moon before 2030,\" Zhang said this week ahead of the looming Shenzhou launch, indicating that the CMSA remains on track to meet its lunar goals.",

      "\"Xania is an extension of me\"",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me, so I look at her as a real person,\" Jones told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Jones created the persona while teaching herself AI just four months ago. The 31-year-old Mississippi native admits she's not a singer, but says the \"lyrics are 100% me,\" and that they come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences.",
      "\"Whether it was stuff I went through, a close family member, or a close friend, I wrote about it.\" Jones said losing her dad at just 8 years old inspired her chart-topping song, \"How Was I Supposed to Know?\"",
      "Billboard says\u00a0Monet is the \"first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to debut on a Billboard radio chart,\" appearing on at least five Billboard charts since her first song release.",
      "\"I'm just taking what I love doing and mixing it with tech,\" explained Jones. She says she doesn't consider using AI as a shortcut, though acknowledges that it \"challenges the norm\" and that often sparks strong reactions.",
      "\"I just feel like AI \u2026 it's the new era that we're in. And I look at it as a tool, as an instrument, and utilize it,\" she added.",
      "Jones outlined her song making process, saying she scrolls through her list of poems to see which she wants to make a song about. She puts the lyrics into an AI music-generator app, then adds different prompts, like slow tempo R&B, female soulful vocals, light guitar and heavy drums \u2014 and then clicks create.",
      "AI artist lands multi-million dollar recording deal",
      "Jones' AI music success led to a multi-million dollar exclusive recording deal with Hallwood Media \u2013 and also some backlash from artists like Grammy-nominated Kehlani. Kehlani railed against the use of AI in creative spaces in a recent TikTok video, saying \"nobody will be able to justify AI to me\" and \"I don't respect it.\"",
      "But Jones says she doesn't let critics stop her from making art.",
      "\"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Technology's evolving. Everybody has different ways of putting in work to get to where they're at. I don't feel that way about it. I still love Kehlani's music. I still listen to her every day,\" she said.",
      "Hallwood Media also defended the artist and said Monet represents a new age of music.",
      "\"What Nikki has done with Xania Monet really represents the future of music. It shows that taste and instinct have always mattered more than technical dexterity, and we're now seeing that play out in real time. AI is breaking down barriers around age, image, and access, giving creators who might not have had a traditional path into the industry the chance to bring their stories and ideas to life while connecting directly with listeners. That kind of innovation is exactly what drives us at Hallwood,\" Danny Jacobson, the head of A&R at Hallwood Media, said in a statement to \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Addressing a concern some have that AI could allow people to make music from racial or cultural backgrounds they may not be a part of, Jones responded, \"That's what I'm here to let them know, I'm Telisha.

    "title": "Supreme Court justices seem skeptical of Trump's sweeping tariffs",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-arguments/",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 19:24:35 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday over whether a federal emergency powers law authorizes President Trump's most sweeping tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A divided Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared skeptical of President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on nearly every country under a federal emergency powers law, as the justices tested a centerpiece of his economic agenda and the limits of presidential powers.",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs marks the first in which the Supreme Court weighed the legal merits of one of the president's signature policies implemented in his second term. Arguments spanned nearly three hours, with the justices asking probing questions of lawyers for the Trump administration and a group of small businesses challenging the legality of the president's tariffs.",
      "But several of the justices appeared uncomfortable with the breadth of power Mr. Trump is asserting without Congress clearly authorizing him to levy broad tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.",
      "Several justices noted that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as IEEPA, which the president has relied on to impose the duties, does not mention the word \"tariff,\" and has never before been used by a president to justify the levies, until now. The Trump administration has argued that the phrase \"regulate importation\" in the law gives the president authority to set import taxes.",
      "But Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer to identity any other provision of the U.S. code where the phrase \"regulate importation\" has been used to confer an authority to impose tariffs, while Chief Justice John Roberts said that Mr. Trump is claiming \"major authority\" to levy duties on any product from any country at any rate for any length of time.",
      "\"The statute doesn't use the word tariffs,\" Roberts said, adding that while the duties deal with foreign powers, \"the vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been a core power of Congress.\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch, meanwhile, raised separation-of-powers concerns and questioned the administration's assertion that Congress, through IEEPA, granted the president broad emergency authority over a foreign-affairs matter. What would stop Congress from \"abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce\" or declare war and give that power to the president?\" he asked.",
      "Once Congress delegates its authority to the president, it's difficult to reclaim, Gorsuch said, warning that the administration's theory marked a \"one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people's representatives.\"",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh appeared sympathetic to the Trump administration's argument. He argued that Congress enacted a statute that gave the president an array of tools for responding to an emergency, and questioned why the law would allow for the imposition of a trade embargo, which may be viewed as an extreme step, as opposed to tariffs, a more targeted punishment.",
      "\"You're forcing the president to respond to an emergency ... and you're taking away the president's suite of tools when the one is much more extreme that is authorized,\" he said. \"That just seems a bit unusual.\"",
      "Kavanaugh pointed to Mr. Trump's tariffs on goods from India over its purchase of Russian oil, which the president is using to pressure Moscow to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"If that's gone, that's a tool that's designed \u2014 talk about foreign-facing, the most serious crisis in the world,\" he said. \"And that's out the window.\"",
      "Trump's tariffs",
      "Three lower courts have concluded that most of the president's tariffs are illegal, and a ruling from the Supreme Court upholding those decisions would deal a blow to Mr. Trump's plans to use tariffs as leverage to push U.S. trading partners to negotiate better trade deals. The president has also claimed that tariffs help to boost domestic manufacturing.",
      "At issue in the case are two sets of duties that Mr. Trump rolled out through a series of executive orders earlier this year. The president has relied on IEEPA to impose the tariffs.",
      "The first tranche set a baseline rate of 10%\u00a0on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as well as higher reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries in response to what he said are \"large and persistent\" trade deficits. The second targeted China, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of varying rates for what he asserted was their failure to stop the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S.",
      "In his executive orders, the president declared trade imbalances and the trafficking of drugs across U.S. borders as national emergencies, which unlocked IEEPA's powers. The law authorizes the president to \"regulate \u2026 importation\" to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security, foreign policy or the U.S. economy. Mr. Trump has argued that trade deficits and the failure to curtail the flow of illicit drugs into the country qualify as such a threat.",
      "Since Mr. Trump announced the import taxes in February and April \u2014 on what he called \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 the administration has reached trade deals with at least 10 countries and the European Union, and said it is \"actively negotiating\" with other nations.",
      "But after the rollout of the new levies, two sets of small businesses and a group of 12 states filed lawsuits arguing that IEEPA doesn't authorize the president's sweeping action. The first case was brought in Washington, D.C., by a pair of Illinois-based educational toy companies. The others, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, came from a group of five small businesses and Democratic officials from 12 states.",
      "The U.S. district court in Washington and the Court of International Trade separately ruled against the administration, concluding that IEEPA doesn't give the president the authority to impose his global and trafficking-related tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the trade court's decision in cases from the five small businesses and states,\u00a0ruled 7-4 that many of the president's levies are illegal. The appeals court found that while IEEPA may authorize some tariffs, the law didn't allow for those \"of the magnitude\" of Mr. Trump's.",
      "Still, it allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the sweeping tariffs while the legal battles play out.",
      "Mr. Trump has also continued to rely on IEEPA to impose new levies or tweak existing rates, including\u00a0raising Canadian tariffs\u00a0to 35% (though many of its goods are subject to exemptions),\u00a0imposing an additional 40% duty on Brazil\u00a0and\u00a0threatening China\u00a0with an additional 100% duty, though the president has since walked that back. Mr. Trump announced last week following a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would be\u00a0reducing the tariffs on goods\u00a0imported from China.",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs on an extremely fast timeline, having\u00a0agreed in September to decide the cases, and could move quickly to issue a ruling.",
      "A key issue in the case may be how the justices view the tariffs: whether they're an exercise of the president's power over foreign affairs or a tax on American consumers.",
      "Neal Katyal, representing the businesses challenging the tariffs, opened his arguments by saying, \"Tariffs are taxes\" and noting that Constitution vested that power in Congress. Echoing Gorsuch, Katyal said that if Congress were to delegate tariffing power to the president, it would be \"a one-way ratchet.\"",
      "\"We will never get this power back if the government wins this case,\" he said.",
      "But Sauer told the high court that they are a tool to regulate foreign commerce.",
      "Roberts acknowledged the tension between the powers at issue, saying \"tariffs are a tax, and that's a core power of Congress.\" But the chief justice also described the levies as a \"foreign-facing tax,\" which involves foreign affairs, a core power of the executive.",
      "\"One thing is quite clear, is that the foreign-facing tariffs have in several situations, were quite effective in achieving a particular objective. So I don't think you can just separate it,\" he told Katyal. \"When you say, well, this is a tax, Congress's power, it implicates very directly the president's foreign affairs power.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds the tariffs to be illegal, as lower courts have done, one question is how potential reimbursements would be handled. Barrett was the only justice to ask about that process, noting that some have said the refunds of tariffs collected from U.S. importers would be \"a mess.\" Katyal said he was only representing five companies, not a class action, and the government would refund the tariffs they paid. He said there was a specialized body of case law to address refunds, though \"it's difficult.\" He suggested the court could offer prospective relief, but there are \"a lot of possibilities.\"",
      "Trump administration argues for presidential powers",
      "In urging the high court to uphold the duties, the Trump administration has argued that Congress has long given the president broad authority to impose tariffs to address emergencies. IEEPA, Sauer wrote in a filing, is a continuation of that tradition because it gives the president the power to \"regulate \u2026 importation.\"",
      "Sauer also said that the tariffs are an exercise of Mr. Trump's power over national security and foreign affairs, and courts should give deference to his determination that the duties are best suited for addressing national emergencies arising from trade deficits and drug-trafficking.",
      "Invalidating those levies, Sauer wrote, would have \"catastrophic consequences\" for national security, foreign policy and the economy.",
      "\"To the President, these cases present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump is highly invested in the case, calling it \"one of the most important in the history of the country.\" The president floated attending the arguments in person, but he reversed course Sunday, writing on social media that he did \"not want to distract from the importance of this decision.\"",
      "Underscoring the importance of the case to the Trump administration, three members of Mr. Trump's Cabinet were in attendance: Treasury Secretary Scot Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.",
      "Asked about the arguments later Wednesday, Mr. Trump told Fox News' Bret Baier a loss would be \"devastating for our country,\" calling it \"one of the most important cases in the history of our country.\"",
      "Businesses warn of economic impact",
      "On the other side, the small businesses warned in court papers that Mr. Trump's tariffs have significant economic consequences. An analysis from the Tax Foundation found the duties will impose $1.7 trillion in new taxes on Americans by 2035, reduce GDP growth by 0.7% per year, and reduce income by 1.1% in 2026.",
      "Katyal, who argued on behalf of the companies before the Supreme Court, said the Trump administration's interpretation of IEEPA is a \"breathtaking assertion\" of power that requires explicit authorization from Congress. IEEPA, he said, doesn't even mention the word tariff or duty, and no president has understood the law to authorize them.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with Mr. Trump that the power to tax is found in IEEPA through the phrase \"regulate \u2026 importation,\" then \"the president, empowered by a supercharged U.S. Code, could tax everything from autos to zoos,\" Katyal wrote in a filing.",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that trade deficits hardly constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat,\" as imbalances have lasted for five decades, and Mr. Trump himself has described them as \"persistent.\"",
      "Additionally, the power to levy taxes and duties rests squarely with Congress, and any delegations of that power have been \"explicit and strictly limited,\" they said. And indeed, there are numerous other statutes in which Congress has delegated its tariffing power \u2014 some of which have been used by Mr. Trump \u2014 though they put constraints on the president.",
      "Testing the boundaries of presidential authority",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's efforts to use IEEPA to impose his sweeping tariffs comes as he has tested the boundaries of his presidential authority, including through his firings of independent agency officials, the withholding of $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress and his efforts to overhaul the executive branch.",
      "Those cases have already been before the Supreme Court, though at earlier stages than the challenges to Mr. Trump's tariffs. In most of those emergency appeals, the conservative justices have allowed the Trump administration to temporarily enforce its policies while proceedings in the lower courts continue.",
      "Like those other cases, the dispute over whether Mr. Trump has the authority to impose duties on nearly every country under IEEPA without Congress could have significant implications for presidential power.",
      "The Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad assertions of executive authority on issues of major political and economic significance when Congress has not spoken clearly, invoking what's called the major questions doctrine to invalidate former President Joe Biden's plan to wipe away more than $400 billion in student loan debt and block an eviction moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "That legal principle is raised in the battle over his tariffs, though the Trump administration argues that it doesn't apply to matters of national security and foreign policy.",
      "\"Judges lack the institutional competence to determine when foreign affairs pose an unusual and extraordinary threat that requires an emergency response; that is a task for the political Branches,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "But lawyers for the small businesses counter that tariffs are a tax on the American people, and the Constitution has vested the taxing power in Congress.",
      "\"The Framers understood that taxation is a potent power that can destroy the taxed as it fills the sovereign's coffers. The Constitution vests that extraordinary power exclusively in the branch of government considered most responsive to the citizenry: Congress,\" lawyers for the Illinois companies wrote in a filing. \"This Court should not lightly assume that Congress abdicated its core taxing power to permit the President to tax Americans with virtually no limits.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ups-plane-crash-louisville-kentucky/",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 19:01:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The number of fatalities may increase after a UPS plane crashed Tuesday near the Louisville International Airport in Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said.",
    "story": [
      "At least 12 people were killed and more than a dozen others injured after a UPS plane crashed shortly after takeoff near the Louisville International Airport on Tuesday, officials said. The National Transportation Safety Board has begun an investigation into the crash, and said Wednesday afternoon it has recovered the black boxes that record plane data.",
      "The death toll rose several times Wednesday, with both Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg warning the number was expected to increase as several people remain unaccounted for. At least 14 people were believed to be missing as of Wednesday night, the governor's office said. The plane was carrying three UPS crew members, but as of Wednesday, officials had not confirmed if they were among the dead.",
      "Beshear said at a Wednesday afternoon news briefing there were \"a handful of other people that we're still searching for.\" Beshear said it's believed one of the victims is a young child.",
      "\"We do not expect to find anyone else alive,\" he said.",
      "Beshear declared a state of emergency on Wednesday.",
      "None of the victims have been identified, officials said Wednesday afternoon. Greenberg said the Jefferson County Coroner has been at the scene and will make identifications. Beshear warned the condition of some of the remains could make identification difficult and might require testing that would take additional time.",
      "Greenberg said the owner of an auto parts business, one of the businesses that was hit by the crash, is a friend of both his and Beshear's. He said the man believes some of his employees and customers were killed.",
      "Beshear\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Wednesday that 16 families have reported loved ones who are unaccounted for, although it was not clear if any of those were part of the increased death toll from throughout the day. Search and rescue operations had ended as of Wednesday afternoon and crews were instead working on recovery, he said.",
      "Health care system UofL Health told CBS News that it received 15 patients across its several hospitals and medical centers. Thirteen of those patients were discharged Wednesday morning, and two remain in critical condition in the intensive care unit at UofL Hospital, the network said. Beshear said Wednesday afternoon that their conditions had not changed as far as he knew.",
      "UPS Flight 2976 crashed around 5:15 p.m. local time after it departed from the Louisville airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The aircraft was headed to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, Hawaii, when it went down three miles south of the airfield, Louisville airport public safety officer Jonathan Biven said at a news conference.",
      "According to preliminary flight data from FlightRadar24, the three-engine McDonnell Douglas MD-11 plane appeared to hit 175 feet in altitude briefly after takeoff. Louisville Fire Chief Brian O'Neill said the plane was carrying about 38,000 gallons of fuel, weighing about 233,000 pounds. That likely led to the significant fire as seen from\u00a0CBS affiliate WLKY-TV's chopper. The plane was also carrying up to 20,000 packages.",
      "Videos of the crash showed the aircraft partially on fire as it sped down the runway before it burst into flames. Other images suggest the plane's left engine separated from the plane during the fire. Debris from the separation may have been sucked into another engine, meaning the plane could not generate sufficient lift to take off.",
      "Investigators from the NTSB and the FAA arrived at the scene Wednesday morning, the aviation agency said. There are 28 NTSB investigators on the ground, McGarvey said. McGarvey said that the\u00a0ongoing government shutdown\u00a0would have no impact on the investigation.",
      "NTSB board member J. Todd Inman confirmed that the plane's left engine appeared to have separated from the plane. He said investigators have also identified the plane's black boxes. He said the devices had \"suffered some heat\" but he felt \"comfortable\" that specialists \"will be able to get a good readout of applicable data\" once the boxes arrive at the NTSB's Washington, D.C., laboratory.",
      "\"While the fire may have been intense, it is built to withstand that,\" Inman said. He noted that it would take at least several days for a readout to be made available.",
      "More than 200 first responders, including 100 firefighters, responded to the fiery crash site, Greenberg said. Dozens of emergency responders remained on the scene as of Wednesday afternoon, Okolona Fire Protection District Chief Mark Little said during the mayor's briefing.",
      "\"To be able to put out a blaze like that, and be able to stabilize a site this size from a giant airplane filled with aviation fuel, this quickly, get kids in school the next day, is pretty special,\" Beshear said.",
      "The debris field is about half a mile long, Inman said Wednesday afternoon. Greenberg said that the intense flames burned away some of the debris, including parts of the plane.",
      "Two businesses were directly impacted, Beshear said Wednesday, including a petroleum recycling facility and the auto parts business. Greenberg said oil stored in the petroleum facility entered waterways, and there were vehicles and lots of scrap metal in the auto parts business, which had complicated search efforts. The plane crashed near a Ford facility but did not hit it, Beshear said.",
      "Beshear said there was no hazardous cargo onboard the plane that would create environmental issues around the crash site, but urged residents to follow any shelter-in-place orders. There is still a shelter-in-place order for those within a quarter-mile radius of the crash site, Greenberg said Wednesday morning. All schools in the Jefferson County School District, the state's largest, with just under 100,000 students, were closed Wednesday, Greenberg said. Schools will reopen Thursday, Beshear said.",
      "Greenberg said Wednesday afternoon that power is being returned to over 100 customers and that water is safe to drink unless residents have received a specific advisory from Louisville officials. Air quality is being monitored, Greenberg said.",
      "Greenberg urged any residents who find debris on their property not to touch it, and instead report it to authorities. Beshear noted Wednesday those who reported debris would likely be visited by the FBI so it could be retrieved. He also warned that residents should avoid flying drones over the crash site, warning that the devices could \"get in the way of our recovery operations\" and that operators risk prosecution and federal fines.",
      "The airport was closed Tuesday following the crash but reopened on Wednesday morning, the Federal Aviation Administration said, though multiple taxiways remain closed.",
      "Louisville International Airport is home to UPS Worldport, an international air hub for the parcel service. The 5.2 million-square-foot facility processes up to 400,000 packages an hour and employs 20,000 UPS workers. The facility sees more than 300 daily UPS flights, according to the company.",
      "Package sorting operations at the facility were paused on Tuesday night and resumed Wednesday morning. UPS said Wednesday morning that sorting for the expedited shipping service Second Day Air was canceled for the day and that employees in that department should not report to work.",
      "Some UPS packages may be delayed because of halted operations. The investigation could also cause further operational delays, if officials need to inspect or review other planes, though UPS could charter additional planes to meet delivery needs.",
      "UPS Airlines planned to operate about 25 MD-11 planes by the end of the year, and is phrasing out the aging three-engine jets for newer and more fuel-efficient two-engine freighters. The crashed plane was built in 1991, according to FAA data.",
      "The Red Cross is providing assistance to the families of victims, McGarvey said. Beshear said that an emergency relief fund has been established to help those affected.",
      "Kris  Van Cleave\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "There was a fire in the UPS plane's left wing and the engine \"detached\" during takeoff from Louisville International Airport in Kentucky, the NTSB official said.",
    "story": [
      "A UPS cargo plane's left wing caught fire and an engine fell off just before it crashed and exploded after takeoff from Louisville International Airport in Kentucky, a federal investigator said Wednesday, offering the first official details about a disaster that killed at least 12 people.",
      "There was a fire in the plane's left wing and the engine \"detached\" during takeoff on Tuesday, said Todd Inman, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation.",
      "\"There are a lot of different parts of this airplane in a lot of different places,\" Inman said during a news conference, describing a debris field that stretched for a half-mile.",
      "The plane with three people on board crashed about 5:15 p.m. ET on Tuesday as it was departing for Honolulu from UPS Worldport at Louisville International. Video showed flames on the plane's left wing and a trail of smoke.",
      "\"The plane lifted off and gained enough altitude to clear the fence at the end of Runway 17R. Shortly after clearing that fence, it made impact with structures and the terrain off of the airport property,\" Inman said.",
      "Inman said the plane's black boxes \u2014 the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder \u2014 were recovered by NTSB investigators on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "He said the black box \"suffered some heat around it, not intrusion,\" but added that \"the recorders are built for that.\"",
      "\"We feel comfortable, once we get these to our lab in D.C., that we will be able to get a good readout of the applicable data,\" Inman said. \"And that will be yet another point of information that will really help us understand what happened during this point of flight.\"",
      "Inman said the crashed plane was a 1991 McDonnell Douglas 2 that was \"altered\" into a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Freighter. He disclosed that the plane was currently being \"handled\" by aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997.",
      "\"So whenever you hear that Boeing is a party, it is because of the merger with McDonnell Douglas many years ago,\" Inman said.",
      "Inman said about 28 NTSB investigators would be on the ground investigating the cause of the crash.",
      "The crash had a ripple effect, striking and causing smaller explosions at Kentucky Petroleum Recycling and hitting an auto salvage yard, Grade A Auto Parts, though it could have been worse, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday during an earlier news conference.",
      "\"Thankfully, a local restaurant that is right there ... was missed and now is helping the search and rescue,\" Beshear said. \"Another blessing is this plane could have potentially hit the major Ford factory or the convention center, those are all close by, and did not.\"",
      "The death toll from the crash was at 11 but was expected to rise to 12 by the end of the day, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg\u00a0said\u00a0in a social media post Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Based on videos of the crash, aviation attorney Pablo Rojas told The Associated Press the aircraft appeared to be struggling to gain altitude as a fire blazed on its left side around one of its engines.",
      "\"Really, the plane itself is almost acting like a bomb because of the amount of fuel,\" he said.",
      "Flight records show the plane was on the ground in San Antonio from Sept. 3 to Oct. 18. Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, told AP it's too early to know whether the problem was in the engine, the structure that holds the engine or something else.",
      "\"This airplane apparently did undergo heavy maintenance within the past month, and investigators will need to comb through the maintenance records to see exactly what was done,\" he said.",
      "The MD-11F is powered by General Electric CF6-80C2D1F engines. The CF6 family of engines has been linked to a few high-profile airline accidents.",
      "In 2016, American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing 767,\u00a0experienced an uncontained engine failure and fire during takeoff in Chicago with a different version of the CF6 engine, and 21 people were injured during the ensuing evacuation. The right engine suffered a sudden rupture of its stage-two disk, and the disk separated into two pieces, the smaller of which pierced the wing's fuel tank and then flew nearly 3,000 feet, falling through the roof of a UPS facility and coming to rest on the building's floor. No one was injured in the UPS building. At the time, the FAA ordered engine inspections.",
      "And in 1989, a CF6-6 engine caused United Airlines Flight 232, a DC-10, to crash land in Sioux City, Iowa. A CF6-6 fan disk separated from the engine and damaged all three hydraulic systems. The DC-10 flew with no hydraulic power until it crash-landed at the airport. Of the 296 people aboard, 112 died and 184 survived.",

      "Starbucks Workers United announced Wednesday that its members voted to authorize a strike as they push to secure a first contract that offers them better pay and more flexible hours. Thousands of union members weighed in, with an overwhelming majority \u2014 92% \u2014 voting in favor of the strike, according to the labor group.",
      "The union said if Starbucks doesn't deliver a contract in the next week, the strike would begin the same day as Starbucks' Red Cup Day, an annual event intended to drum up business for the coffee giant's holiday menu.",
      "The strike would start at coffee shops in 25 U.S. cities, with additional stores later joining in if no progress is made, according to a spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 16:22:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A trend that started in the technology sector is spreading to other industries, with businesses cutting workers even as their profits expand.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year \u2014 the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy.",
      "The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a \"jobless boom.\" Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs.",
      "\"We've never seen anything like that\"",
      "\"This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook,\" Zhao told CBS News. \"It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well.\"",
      "At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted.",
      "\"You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine \u2014 profits are doing great,\" he said. \"We've never seen anything like that.\"",
      "For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as\u00a0\"no hire, no fire,\"\u00a0meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers.",
      "The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP.",
      "By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring.",
      "\"Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. \"While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP.\"",
      "Why unemployment isn't spiking",
      "The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available.",
      "Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said.",
      "\"You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too,\" he said. \"So that creates a very odd equilibrium.\"",
      "Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Pappas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies.",
      "Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Pappas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword.",
      "\"These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up \u2014 it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs,\" he noted.",
      "But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Pappas said.",
      "\"People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'\" he said. \"I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:05:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The shape of economic growth this year highlights the widening gap between wealthy Americans and everyone else, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "To understand how Americans are faring economically these days, it's helpful to consider the eleventh letter of the alphabet.",
      "Experts describe the current U.S. economy as \"K-shaped,\" a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder. The upward-slanting stroke of the \"K\" represents the ongoing trend of strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans.",
      "By contrast, the letter's lower-slanting stroke points to the multiple financial strains facing low- and middle-income people, from stubborn inflation and prohibitively expensive homes to surging credit card debt and high health insurance costs.",
      "This bifurcation of the economy isn't a new phenomenon, with inequality on the rise since the 1980s, noted Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics. But the divide in income and wealth has grown more skewed since the pandemic, reflecting the \"growing gap between the wealthy and the well-to-do and everyone else,\" he said. \"It's taken off.\"",
      "Several trends help explain what's behind the emergence of a K-shaped economy.",
      "Consumer spending",
      "Consumer spending \u2014 which drives over two-thirds of economic activity \u2014 is growing overall in the U.S. These days, however, a large and growing share of that commercial activity is driven by upwardly mobile Americans. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for almost half of all spending, according to an\u00a0analysis of Federal Reserve data by Zandi.",
      "\"That group has always accounted for a much larger share of spending, but that share has risen significantly over time, and now is the highest it's ever been in the data,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Other data tells a similar tale. In September, spending by lower-income households grew 0.6% from a year ago, compared with 2.6% for higher-income consumers, according to a recent\u00a0report from the Bank of America Institute.",
      "Spending on U.S. luxury fashion was also up 8% year-over-year in October, according to the bank's data \u2014 another sign that wealthier households are driving spending.",
      "\"Younger, less affluent households are facing ongoing challenges, while older, wealthier consumers are driving overall spending growth,\" said Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics.",
      "Record stock prices",
      "Because much of their income is held in stock and other securities, affluent Americans have particularly benefited from this year's run-up in financial markets, which have notched record after record largely on the strength of investor excitement about artificial intelligence.",
      "A May Gallup\u00a0poll found that 87% of Americans who own stock live in households with incomes of $100,000 or more. The top 1% of income earners \u2014 who on average earn around $731,000 per year, according to personal finance site SmartAsset \u2014 own nearly half of corporate securities and mutual funds, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "A bullish stock market also benefits the millions of employees with 401(k), mutual funds and other investments, but does much less to lift the many Americans without such holdings, said Tuan Nguyen, an economist at RSM US, an audit, tax and consulting firm.",
      "\"For lower- and middle-income people, especially the ones that live paycheck to paycheck, the rally in the equity markets might not be relatable to them because they are facing higher inflation and lower wage growth,\" he said.",
      "Of late, better-heeled Americans have also seen stronger pay gains. According to the Bank of America Institute, the rate of wage growth for higher-income households in September rose to 4% year-over-year. Annualized pay growth for lower-income households as of August fell to 0.9%, the lowest since the financial giant started tracking the data in 2016, said Taylor Bowley, an economist at the Bank of America Institute.",
      "What lower-income people \"see from the grocery store, from the gas stations, is that prices are going up while their wages are not going up,\" Nguyen added.",
      "Lower-income households also face a toxic stew of inflation, credit card debt, student loans and mortgage loans, sapping their spending power. They also feel the pinch of a slowing job market more acutely than high-income groups, Zandi told CBS News.",
      "\"They may have a job, although if they lose one, they're having a harder and harder time getting back into the labor market,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500 workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

More specifically, he focused on the cost of housing, which seven in 10 voters in New York said was a major problem where they live, and he won among renters, who made up more than half of the electorate.",
      "Voters who made up their minds in the last month of the campaign voted overwhelmingly for Cuomo, but it wasn't enough to make up for the majority of voters who decided on Mamdani before October.",
      "Cuomo led Mamdani among Jewish voters \u2014 most of whom said a candidate's position on Israel was important in their vote.",
      "Mamdani's coalition was led by enormous support among voters under 30 and very liberal voters, but his support extended to all voters under 45 and to those who considered themselves only somewhat liberal, while older voters, as well as moderates and conservatives, voted for Cuomo.",
      "The Republican candidate in the New York City mayoral race, Curtis Sliwa, came in a distant third and didn't even win self-identified Republicans (they voted for Cuomo). Had he dropped out of the race, it might not have made a difference. Though most of Sliwa's supporters said they would have voted for Cuomo, exit polls indicate that in a hypothetical two-way race, Mamdani still would have been victorious.",
      "Mamdani also ran on change, and that was picked as the most important quality in how voters made their decision. A changing electorate was also a hallmark of Mamdani's win \u2014 his strongest support was not just young voters, but also those who were voting in a mayoral race for the first time and those who had moved to New York within the past 10 years.",

    "summary": "Universities have found themselves under pressure from President Trump \u2013 from blocked funds for research, to attacks on their admission policies and diversity programs. Princeton's president says, \"The stakes are really high.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"It's a hard time to be a university president,\" said Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber. \"But even in the best of times, you're dealing with such a wide set of constituencies, right? Trustees, alumni, students \u2026 sometimes the president of the United States.\"",
      "Eisgruber found his university under pressure from President Trump this past spring. Along with other schools, Princeton's federal support was frozen \u2013 more than $200 million in grants. \"These were grants in fields like quantum science or artificial intelligence that are high on our list of priorities, and that are also high on the list of priorities for the Trump administration,\" he said. \"So, we were surprised to see those grants suspended.\"",
      "But for many in Mr. Trump's circle, it was anything but a surprise. It was the latest chapter in the president's shakeup of higher education.",
      "Although Mr. Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, the Ivy League has been one of his biggest targets. In the wake of campus protests, the Trump administration has put an emphasis on addressing charges of antisemitism. In recent weeks the administration has ramped up its efforts, offering universities a so-called \"compact\" in exchange for preferential treatment on funding. Universities would have to align with the White House's priorities, from how it defines gender to protecting conservative speech.",
      "On Oct. 20, May Mailman, who has been a key player inside the Trump White House, told the Fox Business channel, \"The federal government has to make difficult decisions, and universities should only get funding if there's going to be a benefit for Americans on the other side of it.\"",
      "So far, only one university (New College of Florida) has agreed to sign the compact. Many have rejected it (including the University of Pennsylvania, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Southern California), and others are reviewing the terms. Princeton is not signing the compact, and Eisgruber, an expert on constitutional law, calls the proposal \"dangerous.\"",
      "In his new book, \"Terms of Respect: How Colleges Get Free Speech Right,\" Eisgruber defends higher education on free speech, and gives universities a road map on how to navigate free speech issues they encounter.",
      "When asked about his book's conclusion that there is a civic crisis  in the United States, Eisgruber said universities often reflect what is  happening in the culture. \"It's on campuses because it's in society,\" Eisgruber replied. \"So, we've got an American crisis in the United States, where we are having trouble talking to one another across political differences. Campuses are part of that society, and they're a place where civil discussions and discussions across difference are especially important.\"",
      "Free speech and political violence",
      "Princeton has had its own stand-offs over speech. In 2015, students held a sit-in in Eisgruber's office, calling for the renaming of the university's School of Public and International Affairs, citing racist comments by former President Woodrow Wilson; and personnel disputes have led to sharp criticism from some conservatives.",
      "Eisgruber acknowledges there is work to be done, but says universities need to be careful about moving too close to any particular viewpoint in some debates. \"We shouldn't make the mistake of thinking that what we're doing is looking to mirror political views on a college campus,\" he said. \"It's not our job to just be making the same arguments that are being made out in society. So, there might be a lot of division about, say, vaccines within our society, and a scholarly consensus that is inconsistent with those divisions that says vaccines have been safe and vaccines have been effective. There's not some obligation on the part of universities to reflect the political argument.\"",
      "Making things even more complicated is the specter of political violence. When conservative activist Charlie Kirk was gunned down on a college campus in Utah, Eisgruber said, \"I was so deeply saddened. First of all, I was saddened for Charlie Kirk's family. I was saddened for our country and our Constitution, because whatever else is true and whatever political views one may have, we have got to be a country where people can have discussions without the threat of assassination and political violence. So, I worried. I worried about our future because as these events occur, I fear they deepen our crisis  \"",
      "Asked about the reaction by students to such violence, Eisgruber said, \"First of all, I think college campuses are great places to have conversations and great places to be and, in general, safe places to be, right? We've seen a lot of political violence in our country, you know, at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers, at the Israeli embassy in Washington, at the home of the Pennsylvania governor, at our nation's Capitol. So, I think college campuses in general have done a pretty good job of allowing controversial speech.\"",
      "Universities are not the only institutions in American life dealing with the White House: law firms, arts organizations, even late-night hosts have found themselves the targets of criticism from this administration. But longtime leaders in higher ed are keeping close watch on how universities are responding.",
      "Lawrence Summers, the former president of Harvard, said, \"They're facing tougher problems than any university president has faced since the Vietnam War period 50 years ago.\"",
      "Lee Bollinger, who was president of both Columbia and the University of Michigan, said, \"This is a broad-based attack on norms and values that are really fundamental to the United States as we have known it.\"",
      "Back at Princeton, the school is engaging with the Trump administration to protect its research, and it has been able to get roughly half of the suspended grants restored, after underscoring how those efforts \u2013 in science, energy, and other fields \u2013 matter for the country. But Eisgruber and other university leaders know the storm in higher educations is far from over.",
      "\"The stakes are really high,\" he said. \"There are a number of things \u2013 our Constitution, our commitment to freedom, our commitment to the individual \u2013 that have made a difference to America and have strengthened the world. But our investment, our smart investment by the federal government in research universities and education has been critical to the leadership that we have developed in the world, and it is critical to America's future.\"",

    "story": [
      "A second monkey has been shot and killed and authorities said Tuesday that they were still searching for a third missing monkey a week after their escape from a truck that overturned on a Mississippi highway.",
      "Someone shot the monkey after seeing it cross the highway on Monday evening, about a mile from the scene of the Oct. 28 crash, Jasper County Sheriff Sheriff Randy Johnson said. Johnson said he was contacted by a person with the transport company who recovered the monkey after a civilian shot it.",
      "The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks confirmed Tuesday in a news release that one monkey was still unaccounted for after two of the escaped monkeys were \"recovered deceased.\" Officials have warned that people should not approach the Rhesus monkeys, saying they are known to be aggressive.",
      "Over the weekend, a woman who said she feared for the safety of her children shot and killed another escaped monkey after her 16-year-old son saw a monkey outside their home near Heidelberg. Jessica Bond Ferguson said she and other residents had been warned that the escaped monkeys carried diseases, so she shot it.",
      "A truck carrying 21 monkeys overturned on Interstate 59 north of Heidelberg last week and several monkeys escaped. Video from the scene showed monkeys and wooden crates in tall grass beside the interstate. Searchers in protective equipment were seen scouring nearby fields and woods for missing primates. Five monkeys were killed during the search and three were missing initially, officials said.",
      "The monkeys had been housed at the Tulane University National Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana, which routinely provides primates to scientific research organizations, according to the university. Tulane has said it wasn't transporting the monkeys and they do not belong to the university. The remaining 13 monkeys arrived at their original destination last week, according to Tulane.",
      "PreLabs, which describes itself on its website as a biomedical research support organization, said in a statement Monday that a vehicle transporting its non-human primates was involved in the crash and the animals were being lawfully transported to a licensed research facility. It stressed that the monkeys weren't carrying any known diseases, but asked the public not to approach them as they were likely frightened and disoriented.",
      "\"We are cooperating with authorities and reviewing all safety procedures to ensure the continued well-being of both the animals and the community,\" PreLabs said.",
      "Jasper County Sheriff Randy Johnson also said the monkeys were not infectious, citing Tulane officials, despite the truck's occupants previously warning that the monkeys were dangerous and harboring diseases. However, Johnson said the animals would still need to be \"neutralized\" because they were aggressive.",
      "\"The primates in question were not carrying any diseases and had received recent checkups confirming that they were pathogen-free,\" said Andrew Yawn, a spokesperson for Tulane, in a statement.",
      "The monkeys' escape is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public. The Mississippi Highway Patrol has said it was investigating the cause of the crash, which occurred about 100 miles from Mississippi's state capital, Jackson.",
      "Rhesus monkeys, like the ones involved in this incident, have brown fur with red faces and ears, as well as notably expressive faces. They were first imported to the United States for biomedical research in laboratories in the 1970s, according to the New England Primate Conservancy, which has described the monkeys as \"bold, extremely curious and adventurous.\"",

Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent after losing a Democratic primary that he had initially entered as the clear front-runner. The mayoral race drew the attention of President Trump, who endorsed Cuomo the night before the election and threatened to withhold federal funds to New York City under a Mayor Mamdani.",

He pledged to freeze rents on rent-stabilized apartments and raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for a host of new services, like free buses and city-run grocery stores.",
      "When he assumes office, Mamdani will make history as the city's first Muslim mayor. At 34, he'll also be one of the city's youngest mayors, but not the youngest ever: That distinction belongs to Hugh J. Grant, who was 31 when he was elected to his first term in 1889.",

      "In 2018, he became an American citizen.",
      "His parents are political science professor Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair. Mamdani is married to artist Rama Duawaji. They live in Queens, where Mamdani has served as state assemblyman since 2021, representing Astoria, Astoria Heights and Ditmars-Steinway in Queens.",
      "Mamdani's policies",
      "Mamdani focused his campaign around reducing the cost of living. He promised to freeze the rent for\u00a0the city's rent-stabilized units. He has also pledged to provide\u00a0free bus service\u00a0and to open city-owned grocery stores in each borough. Mamdani also says he wants to build 200,000 affordable housing units.",
      "To pay for his proposals, Mamdani has said he would raise taxes on corporations and on top earners by 2%, but he'll need the help of Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state legislature to do it.",

      "Mamdani's position on Israel\u00a0drew scrutiny over the course of the campaign. He condemned\u00a0the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attacks\u00a0on Israel, but also criticized the Israeli government's response, calling the war in Gaza a genocide. Israel said his comments were \"shameful.\"",
      "Mamdani says, while he supports Israel's right to exist,\u00a0he will not say it should exist as a Jewish state.",
      "\"I would not recognize any state's right to exist with a system of hierarchy on the basis of race or religion,\" he said in the candidates' second and final debate.",
      "He also said critics have wrongly accused him of more extreme statements.",
      "\"I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad. That is not something that I have said. And that continues to be ascribed to me. And frankly, I think much of it has to do with that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election,\" Mamdani said during the last debate.",
      "Mamdani and the NYPD",
      "Mamdani came under withering criticism for his past remarks regarding the NYPD. He previously called for disbanding the Strategic Response Group, which was the same unit that responded to the Midtown office shooting in July. He has since walked that back, saying he was opposed to using that unit to respond to protests.",
      "\"I am not defunding the police,\" Mamdani said\u00a0this summer. \"I am not running to defund the police.\"",
      "In an\u00a0October interview with Fox News, Mamdani again apologized for remarks he made about the NYPD in 2020, when he called the department \"racist\" and a \"threat to public safety\" amid nationwide protests after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.",
      "\"We used to ask officers to focus on serious crimes. Now we're asking them to focus also on the mental health crisis, to focus also on homelessness,\" Mamdani said last month. \"Absolutely I'll apologize to police officers right here. Because this is the apology that I've been sharing with many rank and file officers. And I apologize because of the fact that I'm looking to work with these officers, and I know that these officers, these men and women who serve in the NYPD, they put their lives on the line every single day.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is planning to terminate Temporary Protected Status for nationals of South Sudan imminently, CBS News has exclusively learned. The change will end more than a decade of protection that allowed thousands of displaced South Sudanese nationals to live and work legally in the United States.",
      "According to DHS officials, the decision by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem came after consultation with the State Department and other federal agencies.",
      "Despite recent warnings from the United Nations and other organizations that South Sudan could actually be slipping back into a state of open warfare, DHS officials pointed to the end of an armed conflict, improved diplomatic relations and South Sudan's expressed commitment to reintegrating any returning nationals, adding that continuing the TPS designation for South Sudan would be \"contrary\" to U.S. interests.",
      "The designation lapsed on November 3, 2025, and a DHS official tells CBS News that a formal notice of termination will be published in the Federal Register later this week, triggering a 60-day grace period for South Sudanese nationals to depart the country or face deportation once their status officially expires in January. DHS estimates that roughly 5,000 South Sudanese nationals are currently living in the United States.",
      "Over the past 14 years, under the program, South Sudanese nationals who could not safely return to their home country due to armed conflict and environmental disaster were shielded from deportation and allowed to work legally in the U.S. The designation dated back to a period of rampant instability that began when the young nation first gained its independence in 2011. Multiple presidential administrations had since extended the program.",
      "South Sudan's TPS designation was most recently renewed for 18 months, from November 4, 2023, to May 3, 2025, by then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, \"due to ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in South Sudan that prevent individuals from safely returning.\" It was then extended automatically for six months, through November 3, after DHS did not complete a required review before a statutory 60-day window passed.",
      "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country still struggling to recover from years of civil war and humanitarian crises. While DHS says conditions have improved, humanitarian groups and regional experts caution that peace remains fragile, with deepening economic distress creating challenges for any safe return.",
      "U.N. says \"all indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war\"",
      "International mediators have reported some progress toward implementing a peace agreement and transitional governance framework, despite violence, corruption and weak state institutions hampering humanitarian access. But the U.S. State Department maintains a\u00a0Level 4 \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for South Sudan, citing persistent armed conflict, crime and kidnapping.",
      "According to the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations, armed clashes among government troops, opposition forces and ethnic militias continue to claim lives and displace civilians.",
      "The United Nations has documented widespread human rights abuses, including the\u00a0recruitment of child soldiers, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions, and the global body's human rights chief warned as recently as September that the fragile truce could crumble.",
      "\"With fears of a collapse of the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement and a return to widespread violence intensifying, I deeply worry for the plight of civilians in South Sudan,\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in late September.",
      "More recently, a U.N. commission on human rights in the country warned the U.N. General Assembly at the end of October that \"South Sudan's political transition is falling apart.\"",
      "\"The ceasefire is not holding, political detentions have become a tool of repression, the peace agreement's key provisions are being systematically violated, and the Government forces are using aerial bombardments in civilian areas. All indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war,\" commissioner Barney Afako told the U.N.",
      "The U.N.'s\u00a0World Food Program\u00a0has also warned that ongoing conflict, flooding and food insecurity are worsening humanitarian conditions in the country.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the population \u2014 an estimated 9 million people \u2014 require humanitarian assistance, while 7.7 million face acute food insecurity, according to the Congressional Research Service and the\u00a0U.N. Population Fund.",
      "In the run-up to the official termination, DHS is now urging South Sudanese nationals who choose to depart voluntarily to use the Customs and Border Protection \"CBP Home\" mobile app to report their departure. The app, according to the department, offers a \"safe, secure\" way to self-deport, including a complimentary plane ticket, an exit bonus of $1,000 and potential pathways for future legal immigration to the United States, although DHS has not outlined what those pathways might look like.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zohran-mamdani-socialist-2026-midterms-means-for-democrats/",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 23:56:39 -0500",
    "summary": "A Democratic Socialists of America leader says New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani offers a \"powerful way forward\" for Democrats \u2014 but some moderates worry he'll hand the GOP \"a pretty potent set of weapons\" in next year's midterms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory on Tuesday in the New York City mayoral race is already fanning the debate about the future of the Democratic Party and what his sudden political stardom could mean for next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"We hope this is demonstrating a very powerful way forward,\" said Ashik Siddique, a national co-chair of the Democratic Socialists of America. \"This election proves that democratic socialist ideas are very popular.\"",
      "Mamdani ran on promises to confront economic inequality and cost-of-living issues, vowing rent freezes for residents of rent-stabilized units, affordable housing construction, free \u2014 and faster \u2014 bus service, free childcare, city-owned grocery stores to address high food costs and tax hikes on the wealthy.",
      "His victory is the biggest win for progressives since Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated 10-term incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in 2018. But history suggests his success isn't likely to translate to a progressive sweep nationwide.",
      "\"It's very reminiscent of 2018 when you had this superstar, young, telegenic and extremely capable candidate win a primary in New York City and set the world on fire,\" said Matt Bennett, the executive vice president for public affairs for moderate Democratic group Third Way. \"But in the end, the thing that really mattered was that 40 seats were flipped, and Nancy Pelosi got the gavel \u2014 and those seats were flipped by moderates.\"",
      "\"Much ink will be spilled over Mamdani, and he will become a face to the party, but the idea that he will define what it means to be a Democrat, I think, is absurd,\" Bennett said.",
      "Some in the Democratic Party who have been critical of Mamdani rallied behind Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York, who ran as an independent after his defeat by Mamdani in the Democratic primary. Cuomo, the son of liberal icon and former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, was endorsed by the current scandal-ridden New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped his reelection bid, and President Trump.",
      "In the 2024 primary elections, \"mainstream\" Democrats outperformed progressive candidates, winning about two-thirds of the races, according to a study from the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The study also noted just three House candidates and one Senate candidate who identify as democratic socialists won their elections in 2024.",
      "A CBS News poll conducted last week found that just 22% of Democrats nationwide think the party should move toward socialist positions. A majority \u2014 60% of Democrats nationwide \u2014 said their party's economic positions should reflect a mixture of socialist and capitalist ideas. And 5% said the party should move more toward capitalist positions.",
      "Establishment Democratic leaders have mostly offered tepid endorsements of Mamdani, or none at all, and moderate Democrats have been trying to distance themselves from his proposals.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, was slow to endorse Mamdani, offering his backing to the candidate in late October, only a day before early voting began. Neither of the state's Democratic senators, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, gave their endorsement. Former President Barack Obama called Mamdani the weekend before the election, but he stopped short of offering public support.",
      "Jeffries told CNN in an interview Sunday that he does not view Mamdani as the future of the party and is not concerned about Republicans using him as a \"lightning rod\" against Democrats in the elections next November.",
      "That won't stop Republicans from asserting that Mamdani is the new face of the Democratic Party. They're doing it already. The National Republican Campaign Committee, the House GOP's fundraising arm, has been linking Mamdani to vulnerable Democrats in New York, as well as party leaders.",
      "\"The Democrat Party has surrendered to radical socialist Zohran Mamdani and the far-left mob who are now running the show,\" NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement Tuesday. \"Every House Democrat is foolishly complicit in their party's collapse, and voters will make them pay in 2026.\"",
      "Bennett said Mamdani's win and the Democratic Socialists of America platform gives Republicans \"a pretty potent set of weapons\" to use against Democrats running in Republican strongholds and battleground states or districts. He compared it to Republican attack ads against Democrats during the \"defund the police\" movement which gained prominence after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.",
      "\"It raises the level of difficulty to flip places from red to blue,\" Bennett said. \"What we have learned, and we especially learned from the 'defund the police' experience, is that silence is deadly. So Democrats cannot simply presume that their reputation, their brand, the fact that they are local in Wisconsin or Michigan or wherever they're running is going to be enough to convince people that they don't share the Mamdani ideas the Republicans suggest that they do.\"",
      "Also unclear: Whether New York Democrats will help or hinder Mamdani as he tries to implement his far-reaching agenda. He'll need authorization from New York state agencies for proposals like free bus service, and Democrats in Albany will need to greenlight some of the tax increases on high earners that he's proposed in order to pay for his plans.",
      "\"While there is some low-hanging fruit, we believe that many initiatives are not viable in their current form,\" J.P. Morgan Asset Management said in a report on Mamdani's platform last month that argued state lawmakers are unlikely to let him hike taxes on corporations and residents who make over $1 million.",
      "Still, Bennett said there are lessons that Democratic candidates can learn from Mamdani, the most important being his \"crystal clear\" focus on affordability.",
      "\"I don't particularly like his ideas, but he articulated them in ways that really resonated and that people could kind of repeat back to him, and that's a very good lesson for Democrats to take,\" he said.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who also describes himself as a democratic socialist, told CBS News' \"The Takeout\": \"If he wins, the message goes all over this country: You can stand up to the oligarchs, we can start electing members of Congress and mayors and governors who stand with the working class.\"",

    "story": [
      "Horse Cave, Kentucky \u2014 The comeback story of the small southern Kentucky town of Horse Cave began far below its streets in the Hidden River Cave, which for decades wasn't the place of wonder it is now, but a waste dump.",
      "\"Everybody was sick of the smell,\" former Horse Cave Mayor Sandra Wilson told CBS News.",
      "Wilson remembers when the cave was part of the sewer system. And yet, surprising as it may seem, her desire to modernize the sewer system's infrastructure and clean up the Hidden River Cave was met with fierce resistance.",
      "\"We had a lot of people who were wary of rising sewer prices,\" Wilson said. \"The goal was to create the sewer system to clean up the mess. Period.\"",
      "While the people in town fought over sewers, David Foster of the American Cave Conservation Association had a solution that involved convincing the people of Horse Cave to enact new sewer fees to pay for the cleanup. That was not an easy sell, and caused arguments and threats inside city leadership.",
      "\"It happened over 40 years,\" Foster said of the process to complete the new system. \"It wasn't an overnight success story.\"",
      "Putting in a modern sewer system in 1989 allowed the town to open Hidden River Cave to visitors. Building the stairs, trails and a museum cost an additional $6 million, which came from grants and donations. The museum opened in 1993, and tourists could start exploring all the way into the cave's domes in 2020.",
      "But the investment paid off. Last year, 30,000 tourists came to the town of about 3,000.",
      "Today, 10 miles of passageways are open to visitors. The most unique stretch of Hidden River Cave is also the shakiest part, a 100-foot-long suspension bridge, the longest underground suspension bridge in the world.",
      "\"We draw people off the interstate \u2014 that is really close by \u2014 to come here. And everybody loves the tour,\" Wilson said.",
      "Completion of the sewer system also allowed modern factories to open in the area. There are factories near Horse Cave that employ a combined 3,000 workers.",
      "Foster says that without \"patience and determination,\" the town's biggest stinker would never have become its biggest treasure.",

    "story": [
      "Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger will defeat Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the Virginia gubernatorial race, CBS News projected Tuesday, marking one of Democrats' first major victories since President Trump's win last year.",
      "Spanberger will be Virginia's first female governor.",
      "Virginia's off-year gubernatorial race tends to serve as a referendum on the president who was elected a year prior \u2014 and historically, the president's party has almost always lost.",
      "National politics were a throughline in this year's race, especially the Trump administration's sweeping federal layoffs and the still-unresolved month-long government shutdown, which has forced most federal workers to go without pay. Both issues are potent in Virginia, which has nearly 150,000 federal civilian jobs and is home to scores of military personnel.",
      "Spanberger, a former CIA officer and congresswoman, positioned herself as an adversary of the Trump administration and sought to link Earle-Sears to Mr. Trump. She frequently tried to capitalize on frustration over federal layoffs and Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Virginia has moved leftward in recent years, driven by shifts in the fast-growing suburbs of Washington, D.C., though Democrats lost ground last year, with Mr. Trump boosting his share of the statewide vote from 44% in 2020 to 46.1% in 2024.",
      "A year later, however, the president's approval rating in Virginia stands at 42%, with 55% disapproving, according to exit poll data \u2014 a possible liability for Republicans.",
      "But the race also follows months of uncertainty for the Democratic Party, which was stung by its 2024 loss and is still riven by disagreements between its moderate and progressive factions on the party's strategy moving forward. Meanwhile, just 34% of U.S. adults hold a favorable view of the party, compared to 41% for the GOP, according to a CBS News poll from last month.",
      "Earle-Sears, a Marine Corps veteran and former state lawmaker, took aim at Spanberger over immigration and the participation of transgender students in school sports.",
      "In recent weeks, the race has been dominated by a scandal in the usually lower-profile Virginia attorney general election, after text messages surfaced showing Democratic nominee Jay Jones used violent and incendiary language toward Republicans. Spanberger condemned the messages, but Earle-Sears pressed her to call for Jones to drop out of the race.",
      "Spanberger campaigned in the closing stretch with high-profile Democrats like former President Barack Obama, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.",
      "Earle-Sears drew on support from Virginia's popular but term-limited incumbent Gov. Glenn Youngkin, whose economic record Earle-Sears has touted.",
      "But the Republican candidate wasn't explicitly endorsed by Mr. Trump, the leader of her party, even though the president gave his \"complete and total endorsement\" to the GOP nominees in Virginia's attorney general race and New Jersey's gubernatorial race. Mr. Trump has offered some support for Earle-Sears \u2014 but not by name.",
      "\"I think the Republican candidate is very good, and I think she should win because the Democrat candidate's a disaster,\" he told reporters two weeks ago, adding, \"I haven't been too much involved in Virginia.\"",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down\u00a0on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding. Some 35 days later, it surpassed the record for longest shutdown on record.",
      "Republicans have rejected Democrats' push to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018 and early 2019, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency may need to close \"certain parts\" of the nation's airspace if the shutdown drags on.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation may need to close \"certain parts of the airspace\" if the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on record continues into next week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" Duffy said at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",
      "He added, \"We will restrict the airspace when we feel it's not safe.\"",
      "Throughout the 35-day federal shutdown, set to become the longest in U.S. history, Duffy has maintained that commercial air travel remains safe. The tradeoff is that passengers are experiencing more flight delays as officials slow flight traffic based on staffing levels to ensure that the national airspace remains well-monitored, Duffy\u00a0has said at earlier press conferences.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while an additional 4,700 trips were delayed on Monday, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "Duffy said on social media on Wednesday that 46% of the previous day's flight delays were due to staffing issues in air traffic control towers. Ordinarily, personnel issues account for roughly 5% of such delays, according to aviation data.",
      "\"Draconian steps\"?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights following the\u00a09/11 terror attacks for national security reasons, while hurricanes and other weather emergencies can also lead to flight restrictions. But closing parts of the nation's airspace because of staffing issues would be unprecedented, according to aviation industry experts.",
      "\"In this particular instance, Duffy is talking about staffing. He knows the strain and stress this is taking on air traffic controllers,\" Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and an expert on aviation security, told CBS News.",
      "Closing even a portion of the nation's vast airspace would be a major step and likely impact travel nationwide, he added. The system operates on a so-called hub-and-spoke model in which passengers using regional airports can connect with major airports to travel around the U.S.",
      "If the airspace around New York were to close, for example, it could affect passengers in multiple cities, according to Jacobson.",
      "\"For us to take such draconian steps to shut it down in sectors of the country would be unprecedented,\" he said. \"If you shut down the New York area, you shut down a lot of the country because of the interconnectivity of the hub-and-spoke system.\"",
      "More controllers calling in sick",
      "With air traffic controllers working without pay during the shutdown, more than usual are calling in sick, Duffy has said. He has said he is discouraging them from taking on side gigs like delivering for Uber or DoorDash to make ends meet during the funding lapse, given the level of focus that their job requires.",
      "\"The longer this goes on, every day, these hardworking Americans have bills they have to pay, and they're being forced to make decisions and choices,\" Duffy said Tuesday. \"As every day goes by, I think the problem is going to only get worse. Not better.\"",
      "At an Oct. 28 news conference at LaGuardia Airport in New York, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels emphasized that his organization's members are under mounting financial pressures.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "The U.S. Travel Association on Monday urged congressional leaders to end the shutdown, which the industry trade group said could disrupt passengers during the busy Thanksgiving holiday. In 2024, 20 million passengers took to the skies over that week.",
      "\"A shutdown places extraordinary strain on federal personnel who are essential to keeping America moving \u2014 from Transportation Security Administration officers to air traffic controllers, who are forced to work without pay,\" the group said in a Nov. 3 letter. \"When staffing shortages worsen, airport wait times grow longer and flight delays and cancellations become more frequent, threatening to derail family travel plans across the country.\"",

      "It's unclear how long it will take some states to issue SNAP payments since this is an unprecedented situation, said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute.

In a Sept. 5 regulatory\u00a0filing, the board described the proposed compensation package as an \"ambitious plan to retain and incentivize Mr. Musk through the issuance of a highly customized, performance-based restricted stock award.\"",
      "Tesla would be required to hit certain financial and operational milestones for Musk to earn the full pay package. Those include the company reaching a market capitalization of at least $8.5 trillion; delivering 20 million vehicles; producing 1 million self-driving \"robotaxis\"; and manufacturing 1 million of the company's humanoid robots, dubbed Optimus, which are currently under development.",

      "\"If we fail to foster an environment that motivates Elon to achieve great things through an equitable pay-for-performance plan, we run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns,\" Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders posted on social media.",

    "summary": "Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein provided the Justice Department with \"precise and detailed\" information about 20 alleged co-conspirators, House Democrats say.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, is seeking documents from the Justice Department on its move earlier this year to end the investigation into alleged co-conspirators of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"I write to demand an explanation for why DOJ has abandoned the women and girls abused by Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators, fired or cut off career prosecutors from the case, and ceased its investigation into one of the largest sex trafficking rings in history,\" Raskin wrote in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, which was first obtained by CBS News.",
      "The demand comes amid relentless bipartisan interest in the investigation, which has dogged the Justice Department's top officials as they've sought to put the matter to rest. Some in the Trump administration, including Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, promised major revelations into the Epstein matter before taking office, only to indicate later that the case was closed.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on Raskin's letter and will update this story with any response.",
      "In the letter, Raskin said almost 50 survivors provided information to prosecutors and FBI agents as part of the investigation that ultimately led to the indictments of Epstein in 2019 and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2020. Raskin said the information the survivors provided was \"precise and detailed.\"",
      "\"They described how Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators orchestrated a sophisticated and clandestine sex trafficking conspiracy that trafficked them to at least 20 men,\" Raskin said. \"These survivors shared with DOJ and FBI the specific identities of many of these co-conspirators, how this operation was structured and financed, and which individuals facilitated these crimes.\"",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York was running an active investigation into Epstein and Maxwell's co-conspirators until January 2025, when prosecutors were directed to transfer the Epstein case files to the Justice Department's headquarters, in what Raskin said was \"a sudden and dramatic shift in the posture of the investigation.\" Since then, \"the investigation into co-conspirators has inexplicably ceased,\" he said, citing information provided to the Judiciary Committee by attorneys who represent Epstein survivors.",
      "Then in July, the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review, which it said found no \"client list\" among the evidence collected by investigators. It also \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate any investigation against uncharged third parties.\" Bondi suggested during a Fox News interview in February that a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk awaiting her review.",
      "\"DOJ and FBI's failure to investigate this conduct is a betrayal of the more than 1,000 survivors of this multi-billion-dollar international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin wrote. \"As these survivors made clear to DOJ and FBI, Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell did not act alone.\"",
      "Raskin said many of the women spoke with prosecutors and agents, and the interviews were summarized in 302 forms, a document used by the FBI to memorialize information that may later come up in courtroom testimony. Along with the women, Raskin said federal law enforcement agents who worked on the case understood that the investigation was continuing up until January. In Supreme Court filings, Raskin pointed out, the government said the pursuit of Epstein's co-conspirators was ongoing during the Biden administration.",
      "Raskin said the committee is considering reforms that would clarify prosecutors' responsibility to communicate with crime survivors before investigations are closed. And he accused Patel of having \"repeatedly impugned the credibility of the Epstein survivors\" at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September by suggesting that the information provided by the survivors was not credible.",
      "During the hearing, Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has led an effort to force a vote in the House on releasing the Epstein files, pointed to 20 alleged co-conspirators.",
      "\"According to victims who cooperated with the FBI in that investigation, these documents in FBI possession, your possession, detail at least 20 men, including Mr. Jes Staley, CEO of Barclays Bank,\" Massie said, referring to a banker who left Barclays in 2021 amid scrutiny over his ties to Epstein. Staley, who worked with Epstein for years as a top official at J.P. Morgan, has said they had a \"close professional relationship.\" Staley has denied wrongdoing and said he regrets befriending Epstein.",
      "Massie said other high-profile figures were among those named by Epstein's victims.",
      "\"That list also includes at least 19 other individuals \u2014 one Hollywood producer worth a few hundred million dollars, one royal prince, one high-profile individual in the music industry, one very prominent banker, one high-profile government official, one high-profile former politician, one owner of a car company in Italy, one rockstar, one magician, at least six billionaires, including a billionaire from Canada,\" Massie said.",
      "Massie asked Patel if the FBI had launched any investigations into the individuals and whether he'd seen the 302 documents. Patel responded that he has asked FBI agents to \"review the entirety of the Epstein files and bring forth any credible information.\" He said \"any investigations that arise from any credible investigation will be brought,\" but he added that there have been \"no new materials brought to me launching a new indictment.\"",
      "Asked whether he was asserting that the victims' statements weren't credible, Patel said, \"It's not my assertion, sir, it's the assertion of two different United States attorneys' offices from three separate administrations who investigated those same materials in live time.\"",
      "Raskin said Patel's explanation, along with a later exchange with Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, was not good enough. He wrote in his letter that he is seeking \"an accounting\" of the steps the Justice Department has taken to review the case this year, relevant summaries or reports generated as part of that review and documents related to staffing for Epstein investigative matters.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has inexplicably killed this investigation,\" Raskin said.",

    "summary": "President Vladimir Putin says Russia has adhered to a ban on nuclear test explosions after President Trump claimed Moscow is testing nuclear weapons.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed his government to submit proposals on the possible resumption of nuclear weapons testing in response to President Trump instructing the Pentagon to do so \"on an equal basis\" with other countries.",
      "In a meeting Wednesday with his Security Council, Putin said Russia has adhered to the international Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which prohibits nuclear test explosions.",
      "But, he said, \"if the United States or any other state party to the Treaty was to conduct such tests, Russia would be under obligation to take reciprocal measures.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in an\u00a0interview with 60 Minutes\u00a0that Russia is among a handful of countries testing nuclear weapons when asked about his order.",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell. \"We're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.\"",
      "It is unclear what type of testing Mr. Trump is ordering. The last time the U.S. detonated a nuclear device as part of a test was in 1992.",
      "\"No one knows what Trump meant about 'nuclear testing' (he probably doesn't himself),\" Dmirty Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, wrote in a post on social media Wednesday.",
      "\"But he's the president of the United States,\" his post continued. \"And the consequences of such words are inescapable: Russia will be forced to assess the expediency of conducting full-fledged nuclear tests itself.\"",
      "China was the first of the nations accused by Mr. Trump to deny any secret nuclear testing. A Pakistani official told CBS News that the country \"will not be the first to resume nuclear tests.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the assertion to O'Donnell just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. Russia's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1990, and China's was in 1996.",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.",
      "Along with China and several other nuclear powers, however, the U.S. has never ratified the treaty, a situation that Putin highlighted in 2023 when he decided to\u00a0revoke Moscow's ratification.",
      "While Russia has stepped up its own tests of nuclear-capable and even\u00a0nuclear-powered weapons systems, it has not announced any resumption of nuclear test detonations.",
      "Putin's revocation of Russia's CTBT ratification exactly two years ago fueled speculation that he could order new nuclear detonation tests, along with calls from hawkish members of the Russian parliament for the country to do so. Putin previously suggested that Russia would resume nuclear explosive tests if the U.S. were to do so first.",
      "One year ago, Putin approved changes to Russia's official nuclear doctrine, formally amending the conditions \u2014 and lowering the threshold \u2014 under which Moscow would consider using its nuclear weapons.",
      "The updated doctrine, which was announced just as Ukraine launched its first strike deeper into Russia with U.S.-supplied missiles, states that Russia will treat an attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a country with nuclear capabilities as a joint attack by both.",
      "That means in theory that any attack on Russia by a country that's part of a coalition could be seen as an attack by the entire group. Under the doctrine, Russia could theoretically consider any major attack on its territory, even with conventional weapons, by non-nuclear-armed Ukraine sufficient to trigger a nuclear response, because Ukraine is backed by the nuclear-armed United States.",
      "Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine multiple times since he ordered the full-scale invasion of the country on Feb. 24, 2022, and Russia has repeatedly warned the West that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire Western-made missiles deep into its territory, it would consider the U.S. and its NATO allies to be directly involved in the war.",
      "Mr. Trump has so far declined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's repeated requests for U.S.-made Tomahawk long-range missiles.",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "Mr. Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plan to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal includes conducting actual atomic explosions, which have not been carried out in the U.S. for over 30 years, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",

      "The suspect has been identified as Algerian national Brahim Kaddour Cherif. Police said he is a registered sex offender who was convicted of indecent exposure last year, sentenced to an 18-month community order and put on the sex offenders' register for five years.",
      "The BBC reported that Cherif last appeared in court in September, charged with failing to comply with requirements for convicted sex offenders.",
      "\"Cherif has had a six-day head start but we are working urgently to close the gap and establish his whereabouts,\" Paul Trevers, who is overseeing the police investigation, said in a statement.",
      "The second man mistakenly released, 35-year-old William Smith, was let go from the same prison as Cherif on Monday, police in Surrey said. He was released the same day he appeared at a hearing where he received a 45-month sentence for multiple fraud offenses.",
      "\"I am absolutely outraged and appalled by the mistaken release of a foreign criminal wanted by the police. The Metropolitan police is leading an urgent manhunt, and my officials have been working through the night to take him back to prison,\" David Lammy, U.K. deputy prime minister and justice secretary, said in a statement after reports emerged of the first mistaken release, according to the BBC.",
      "\"Victims deserve better and the public deserve answers. That is why I have already brought in the strongest checks ever to clamp down on such failures and ordered an independent investigation, led by Dame Lynne Owens to uncover what went wrong and address the rise in accidental releases which has persisted for too long,\" Lammy said.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called that release \"utterly unacceptable\" and said the issue of accidental prisoner releases \"needs to be dealt with, and the system needs to be reformed and the appropriate checks need to be in place to stop this type of thing from ever happening,\" according to The Guardian.",
      "Just last week, the accidental release of Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian man jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, triggered a two-day manhunt and his eventual deportation. British authorities agreed to give him the equivalent of about $600 to get on a plane, rather than filing a new legal challenge to his deportation.",
      "The number of prisoners released from U.K. prisons by mistake has more than doubled in the last year, according to government data analyzed by Britain's Telegraph newspaper.",
      "About 262 prisoners were mistakenly released from March 2024 to March 2025, compared to 115 during the same period the previous year, the Telegraph reported.",
      "An official review of the issue has begun, but Ian Acheson, a former prison governor and adviser to U.K. government ministers, cited the overcrowding of Britain's prisons as a reason for the rise in accidental releases.",
      "Overcrowding has brought more pressure on the prison managers to get offenders out as quickly as possible, which has led to more movement of prisoners within the prison system, Acheson told the Telegraph newspaper.",
      "\"It is quite possible that one of the reasons for the increase in these mistakes has been the push and imperative to get people out,\" Acheson told the Telegraph.",

    "story": [
      "Shejaiya, Gaza Strip \u2014 The Israeli military brought our CBS News team for a rare look deep inside the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, to the Shejaiya neighborhood in the Palestinian territory's former de-facto capital, Gaza City.",
      "Shejaiya saw extremely fierce fighting before the U.S.-brokered peace deal between Israel and Hamas brought a fragile ceasefire to Gaza. The neighborhood is now a scene of utter destruction.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces says the bodies of several deceased hostages \u2014 21 of whom have now been returned from Gaza \u2014 were found amid the rubble in Shejaiya, including Israeli American IDF soldier Itay Chen, whose remains were\u00a0brought back to Israel on Tuesday night.",
      "The IDF brought CBS News to a location within a few hundred yards of the \"yellow line,\" the new boundary to which its forces have withdrawn under the ceasefire. The military has not allowed CBS News or other foreign outlets to report independently inside Gaza since the war began, though it has offered a few previous IDF-organized and guided media tours.",
      "The line cuts the Gaza Strip roughly in half, with the IDF in control of the eastern portion of the coastal territory, along its border. Most of Gaza's roughly 2 million residents have been pushed inside the yellow line, where they're living in the rubble and destruction left behind by two harrowing years of war.",
      "Hamas has attempted to reassert its authority inside the yellow line,\u00a0rounding up rivals and executing some it accuses of collaborating with Israel.",
      "But despite serious challenges and regular accusations by both sides that the other is violating the deal, the ceasefire has held for nearly a month.",
      "More trucks carrying humanitarian aid are getting into Gaza, delivering much needed food and fuel.",
      "But the process of returning the bodies of hostages to Israel has been much slower than was hoped, with seven of the deceased captives still in Gaza.",
      "Sporadic deadly violence has also tested the peace deal, with Israel accusing Hamas of killing its soldiers and then responding with lethal strikes.",
      "The big question now is what happens next.",
      "The United Nations\u00a0has estimated that it will cost $70 billion to rebuild the Gaza Strip, and it's not yet clear where that money will come from.",
      "President Trump's 20-point peace plan refers to a development plan to be created by a panel of experts, but it is light on details. The plan also calls for the demilitarization of Gaza, but many are skeptical that Hamas will ever completely give up its weapons, at least willingly.",
      "If that doesn't happen, Israel may be reluctant to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip, as envisioned by Mr. Trump's plan.",
      "If the plan doesn't stay on track, the fear is that the people of Gaza could be left in limbo, with very little hope of rebuilding their lives \u2014 and possibly with far less of the Gaza Strip's land left to do it in.",

    "summary": "Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum says the harassment she suffered from a drunk man near the government seat is an assault on all women.",
    "story": [
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that the harassment she suffered from a drunk man in the street near Mexico's seat of government was an assault on all women, and that's why she decided to press charges against him.",
      "Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada had announced overnight that the man was arrested.",
      "In a video circulating widely on social platforms, the man appeared to lean in for a kiss and touch the president's body with his hands on Tuesday. She gently pushed his hands away, maintaining a stiff smile as she turned to face him. She could be heard saying, in part, \"Don't worry.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Sheinbaum was firm in emphasizing that this was not the first time she had suffered such harassment and that the problem went far beyond her.",
      "\"No man has the right to violate that space,\" she said\u00a0in a video the Mexican government shared on social media when it announced charges had been filed.",
      "\"I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\" Sheinbaum continued, adding that she also experienced it earlier in her life, as a student.",
      "\"My reflection is that if I do not report the crime, what condition does that leave Mexican women in?\" she said.",
      "The incident also raised questions about the president's security. Sheinbaum explained that she and her team had decided to walk from the National Palace to the Education Ministry to save time. She said they could walk it in five minutes, rather than taking a 20-minute car ride. She said she would not change how she acts.",
      "Speaking out in solidarity with the president, Brugada used some of Sheinbaum's own language about being elected Mexico's first woman president to emphasize that harassment of any woman \u2014 in this case, Mexico's most powerful \u2014 is an assault on all women. When Sheinbaum was elected, she said that it wasn't just her coming to power, it was all women.",
      "\"If they touch the president, they touch all of us,\" Brugada wrote in\u00a0a statement released Wednesday. Her statement went on to note that Sheinbaum's references to the collective \"arrival\" of women to power in Mexico is \"not a slogan, it's a commitment to not look the other way, to not allow misogyny to continue to be veiled in habits, to not accept a single additional humiliation, not another abuse, not a single femicide more.\"",
      "Mexico's National Governors Conference also voiced its support for the president as news broke that she would bring charges against the man.",
      "\"From CONAGO we condemn any aggression against women, in this case the aggression toward the president of Mexico,\" the group said in a statement shared on social media. \"Every form of violence against a woman is unacceptable and should have no place in a society that aspires to live with respect and equality.\"",

    "summary": "Mayor-elect Mamdani's win in New York is cheered by his London counterpart and a former mentor in Uganda, but draws a warning from Israel's U.S. ambassador.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Zohran Mamdani's win in New York City's mayoral race has ignited passions for and against him, from pride in his birthplace of Uganda and applause from his counterpart in London to anger from Israel's top diplomat in the U.S.",
      "Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist who will be the city's first Muslim mayor, and his victory left some people in Africa beaming with pride for a hometown son. Mamdani was born in the East African nation of Uganda 34 years ago, then lived in South Africa for two years before moving with his family to New York as a child.",
      "\"What a moment! It was beautiful! I am excited!\" cheered Joseph Beyanga, CEO of Uganda's National Association of Broadcasters, pumping his hands in the air as he spoke with CBS News.",
      "Beyanga said he was Mamdani's mentor when the now-mayor-elect interned at one of Uganda's top newspapers, the Daily Monitor, during a vacation when he was in high school.",
      "\"Whatever he wanted to do, there was no middle point. Always he wanted the top,\" recalled Beyanga. \"Then I realized he was not just interested in current affairs. He was interested in how the current affairs affect the people. If you're talking about big money, the budget and all that, how does this affect the last person \u2026 he was interested in how it affects the people.\"",
      "\"When it was time to interact with people, he talked to people looking straight in the eye,\" he said.",
      "Beyanga added that even 17 years after he met Mamdani, he still sees the same person in the New York City politician.",
      "\"Nothing has changed. His heart is with the people, and I don't think that will change,\" he said. \"I've seen other outlets calling him populist and opponents giving him all sorts of names. I see a man after the heart of serving people, serving the down-trodden people in society. And hey, that doesn't come far away from who he is. He is a Ugandan boy, and the Ugandan boy cares for the people.\"",
      "Beyanga compared excitement in Uganda now to the exuberance among many Kenyans and Indonesians when former President Barack Obama was first elected.",
      "\"The Ugandans are having their Mamdani moment,\" Beyanga told CBS News, \"and yes, we say if he did it, yes we can!\"",
      "In the United Kingdom, London Mayor Sadiq Khan \u2014 who became the British capital's first Muslim leader when he was first elected in 2016 \u2014 voiced solidarity with his new counterpart. Khan is currently serving his third consecutive term.",
      "\"New Yorkers faced a clear choice \u2014 between hope and fear \u2014 and just like we've seen in London \u2014 hope won,\" Khan said in a social media post. \"Huge congratulations to Zohran Mamdani on his historic campaign.\"",
      "Following Mamdani's election win, Time magazine published an article by Khan, who called it \"extraordinary\" that two of the world's most influential cities will be led by people of the same faith.",
      "\"But \u2014 in two of the most diverse cities on Earth \u2014 it's a bit beside the point,\" Khan said. \"We did not win because of our faith. We won because we addressed voters' concerns, rather than playing on them.\"",
      "\"Mayor Mamdani and I might not agree on everything. Many of the challenges our cities face are similar, but they are not identical. Put policy differences aside, though, and it's clear that we are united by something far more fundamental: our belief in the power of politics to change people's lives for the better.\"",
      "Mamdani, a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights, has been accused of antisemitism and being pro-Hamas, which he denies.",
      "He has also been called out for refusing to condemn the phrase \"globalize the intifada.\" Intifada is an Arabic word that means uprising, but which is widely viewed as a slogan inciting violence against Israel. However, during his campaign he said he would \"discourage\" others from using the phrase and that it \"is not language that I use.\"",
      "\"Mamdani's inflammatory remarks will not deter us,\" Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Dannon said in a social media post on Wednesday. \"The Jewish community in New York and across the United States deserves safety and respect. We will continue to strengthen our ties with Jewish community leaders to ensure their security and well-being.\"",
      "CBS News' team in Israel said domestic media reports and editorials covering Mamdani's win were largely split along ideological lines. Left-wing commentary generally called for Mamdani to be given a chance, while more right-wing outlets leaned the other way.",
      "On Wednesday morning, the Times of Israel's front-page headline read: \"Far-left, anti-Israel candidate Zohran Mamdani wins New York City mayoral race.\"",
      "The Jerusalem Post's top featured editorial said: \"Mamdani winning in NY means antisemitism can win elections, would impact Jews globally.\"",

      "The court in the western city of Aachen found the 44-year-old man guilty of the offenses committed between December 2023 and May 2024 in a hospital in Wuerselen, near Aachen.",
      "The court also determined that the offenses carried a \"particular severity of guilt\" which should bar him from early release after 15 years, normally an option in such cases.",
      "The man, who has not been publicly named, was accused by prosecutors of playing \"master of life and death\" over those in his care. His defense had demanded an acquittal at the trial which began in March.",
      "Prosecutors said he injected the mostly elderly patients with large doses of sedatives or painkillers, with the simple aim of reducing his workload during night shifts.",

      "Lack of empathy",

      "More recently, in July, a 40-year-old palliative care specialist named by media as Johannes M. went on trial in Berlin accused of killing 15 patients\u00a0with lethal injections between 2021 and 2024.",
      "In at least five cases, he is suspected of setting fire to his victims' homes in an attempt to cover up his crimes. Prosecutors and police\u00a0said\u00a0he had no motive beyond killing and that the suspect's acts meet the legal definition of \"lust for murder.\"",

      "The U.S. Embassy criticized the escape as \"utterly unacceptable\" and called on the Guatemalan government to \"act immediately and vigorously to recapture these terrorists.\"",
      "After the jailbreak, President Bernardo Arevalo dismissed his Interior Minister, Francisco Jimenez. He replaced him with Marco Antonio Villeda, who requested the FBI's assistance in tracking down the escapees.",
      "Villeda told reporters on Tuesday that the FBI's Joint Task Force Vulcan would participate in the operation.",
      "The specialized task force was created by Donald Trump in 2019, during his first term as president, with the aim of dismantling Latin American criminal organizations.",
      "It was originally intended to target the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang.\u00a0 According to the Salvadoran government, Barrio 18 and MS-13 are responsible for the deaths of about 200,000 people over three decades.",

      "King Charles III tapped his shoulders with the blade of a sword and \"Becks\" was transformed to Sir David Beckham.",
      "\"This is without doubt my proudest moment,\" Beckham said after Tuesday's ceremony at Windsor Castle. \"I've been very obviously lucky in my career to have won what I've won and done what I've done, but to receive an honor like this, of a knight, is beyond anything that I ever thought that I would receive.\"",
      "The distinction marks the pinnacle of Beckham's effort to rehabilitate his image following events that at times alienated him from fans during a long and distinguished career. He also has had a very public persona as a fashion model, husband to Victoria \"Posh\" Beckham of the Spice Girls and \"Bend it Like Beckham\" movie muse.",
      "The 50-year-old was knighted for his services to sport and charity, having partnered with UNICEF, the U.N.'s children's fund, for two decades and campaigned with a charity working to eradicate malaria. He also played a pivotal role in London being awarded the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.",
      "Nobel Prize-winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, author of \"The Remains of the Day\" who previously was knighted, was recognized in Tuesday's ceremony as a Companion of Honor for literature. Renowned musicals singer and actor Elaine Paige was given a damehood, the female equivalent of a knighthood.",
      "Beckham is the only English soccer player to score at three different World Cups, and his career included the triple-winning campaign of 1999, when Manchester United won the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Champions League.",

      "After leaving Manchester United in 2003 \u2014 a move that devastated fans \u2014   Beckham played for Real Madrid, Los Angeles Galaxy and Paris Saint-Germain. He now co-owns the Major League Soccer team Inter Miami.",
      "His career hit a low point at the 1998 World Cup in France, where Beckham was widely vilified for his petulant kick of Argentina player Diego Simeone, which saw him sent off and left the team short a player. Many fans blamed him for England's exit from the championship.",
      "In 2023's Netflix documentary series \"Beckham,\" he described the abuse he experienced, which included an effigy of him hanging from a noose outside a London pub.",
      "\"I knew it was bad at the time, but going over that whole thing was quite a tough one,\" he told The Associated Press at the time.",

      "Bears have shown up near schools, train stations, supermarkets and even a hot springs resort, with attacks by the animals reported almost daily across Japan, mostly in the north.",
      "Since April, more than 100 people have been injured and at least 12 killed in bear attacks across Japan, according to Environment Ministry statistics at the end of October. That is the highest number of people killed by the animals in the country in one fiscal year since 2006, when the ministry started compiling the statistics.",
      "\"Every day, bears intrude into residential areas in the region and their impact is expanding,\" Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Fumitoshi Sato told reporters. \"Responses to the bear problem are an urgent matter.\"",
      "The Defense Ministry and Akita prefecture signed an agreement on the troop dispatch on Wednesday afternoon, allowing soldiers to set box traps with food inside, transport local hunters and help with the disposal of dead bears. The soldiers will not use firearms to cull bears, officials said.",

The Japanese SDF is already understaffed.",
      "So far, the ministry has not received other requests for troop assistance over the bear issue, he said.",
      "In Akita prefecture, which has a population of about 880,000, bears have attacked more than 50 people since May, killing at least four, according to the local government. Experts say 70\uff05 of the bear attacks have occurred in residential areas.",
      "An elderly woman who went mushroom-hunting in the forest was found dead in an apparent bear attack over the weekend in Yuzawa City in the prefecture. Another elderly woman in Akita city encountered a bear while working on a farm and was killed in late October. And a newspaper delivery man was attacked by a bear and suffered an injury in Akita city on Tuesday.",
      "Experts say Japan's aging and declining population in rural areas are among the reasons for the growing bear problem in recent years.",
      "Abandoned neighborhoods and farmland with persimmon or chestnut trees often attract bears to residential areas. Once bears find food and acquire a taste, they keep coming back, experts say.",
      "Local hunters are also aging and not used to bear hunting. Experts say police and other authorities should be trained as \"government hunters\" to help cull the animals.",
      "The government set up a taskforce last week to create an official bear response by mid-November. Officials are considering bear population surveys, the use of communication devices to issue bear warnings and revisions to hunting rules. They also say experts should be trained in hunting and ecology.",
      "The lack of preventive measures in the depopulated and aging northern regions have also led to an increase in the populations of brown bears and Asiatic black bears, the ministry said.",

      "They said a \"fundamental irregularity\" had taken place while the jury was sequestered that \"fatally undermined the integrity of the verdicts,\" without giving further details.",
      "But local media, citing the court, said the jurors were put up in the same hotel as police and prosecutors for most of their deliberations, according to the Reuters news service.",
      "Patterson's lawyer also accused the prosecution of an \"unfair and oppressive\" cross-examination during the trial.",
      "And her lawyer said evidence submitted and accepted by the judge wasn't relevant to her case while other evidence wasn't admitted but should have been.",
      "She also requested that she not be physically present in court should an oral hearing into her case go ahead.",
      "Patterson was sentenced in September and a judge said she would be eligible for parole after 33 years.",
      "The prosecution has since appealed what it called a \"manifestly inadequate\" sentence.",
      "Throughout a trial lasting more than two months, Patterson maintained the beef-and-pastry dish she served was accidentally poisoned with death cap mushrooms \u2014 the world's most lethal fungus.",

      "The attack was carried out at the direction of President Trump, Hegseth said in a social media post that included unclassified video of the strike.",
      "\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Hegseth said.",

      "Dating back to early September, the Trump administration has reported well over a dozen such strikes in the waters of the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean off South America on what it alleges are drug vessels. The strikes have killed more than 50 people.",
      "Outside of the unclassified videos released by the Defense Department, the U.S. has provided no details on the boats that were struck or about the people aboard.",
      "The White House says they are part of an effort to cripple the operations of drug cartels. Some lawmakers have criticized the strikes, saying the White House has not provided enough evidence the boats were smuggling drugs, and with some insisting the president needs congressional approval to carry out the strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump on Oct. 23 told reporters, \"Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead.\"",
      "Several of the strikes have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, as Mr. Trump has been vocal in his criticism of controversial Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and amid a broader buildup of U.S. military assets in the Caribbean.",

    "story": [
      "The remains of a hostage in Gaza have been turned over and are now in Israel, the Israeli military said Tuesday, in the latest sign of progress under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces later confirmed the remains belonged to Itay Chen, the last Israeli American hostage held in Gaza. Chen died during battle at Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023, and his body was taken to Gaza. He was 19 years old, the IDF said.",
      "Chen is survived by his parents and two brothers.",
      "With the IDF's confirmation, Hamas has returned the remains of 21 hostages to Israel under the ceasefire that began Oct. 10. The remains of seven others are still in Gaza. The\u00a0process of returning the bodies\u00a0of the last remaining hostages, as called for under the U.S. peace plan, has progressed slowly, with Hamas releasing just one or two bodies every few days.",
      "Hamas says it has\u00a0not been able to reach all of the remains\u00a0because they are buried under rubble of buildings destroyed by Israel's two-year offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, the military wing of Hamas said it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier in Gaza and intended to hand over the remains. Israel's statement did not indicate whether the remains were of a soldier.",
      "Israel has pushed to speed up the returns and, in certain cases, has said the remains were not those of hostages. Israel's government and the families of the hostages have accused Hamas of dragging its feet, threatening to resume military operations or withhold humanitarian aid if all of the remains are not returned.",
      "Hamas has said the work is complicated by widespread devastation.",
      "For each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians. So far, the bodies of 270 Palestinians have been handed over under the current ceasefire. Fewer than half have been identified. Forensic work is complicated by a lack of DNA testing kits in Gaza. The Hamas-run Health Ministry posts photos of the remains online, in the hope that families will recognize them.",
      "The war was triggered by the Hamas-led terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage.",
      "Israel responded with a sweeping military offensive that has killed more than 68,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health there, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.",
      "Israel, which has denied accusations by a United Nations commission of inquiry and others of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the ministry's figures without providing a contradicting toll.",
      "The deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas was winding down due to the ceasefire, but\u00a0attacks briefly resumed last month\u00a0after Israel accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire.",

    "story": [
      "Thirteen suspected drug cartel members died Monday in a shootout with authorities in the troubled Mexican state of Sinaloa, officials said.",
      "Another four suspects were arrested and nine people kidnapped by the gang were freed following the clash in Guasave, a municipality in the northwestern state, Security Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch said in a social media post.",
      "He said security personnel carrying out a patrol were attacked by gunmen hiding under a bridge, prompting officers to respond.",
      "After the firefight, the law enforcement officers also seized seven vehicles, high-powered weapons and tactical equipment, Garcia Harfuch said.",
      "Sinaloa has been rocked for more than a year by a conflict between factions of a powerful local cartel. The violence has left at least 1,700 people dead, 57 of them minors, and nearly 2,000 missing.",
      "The cartel's internal war began after the capture of Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the group's historical leader, who was betrayed and taken to the United States in July 2024 by a son of his former partner, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman.",
      "Following their arrests and Zambada's allegations of kidnapping,\u00a0horrific fighting erupted\u00a0in Mexico between a cartel faction loyal to him and another tied to the \"Chapitos,\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons.",
      "The Chapitos have used corkscrews and electrocution to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers,\" according to an indictment released by the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "In recent months, bodies have appeared across Sinaloa, often left slung out on the streets or in cars with either\u00a0sombreros on their heads\u00a0or pizza slices or boxes pegged onto them with knives. The pizzas and sombreros have become informal symbols for the warring cartel factions, underscoring the brutality of their warfare.",
      "Last week, authorities said El Chapo's hometown was hit in attacks by explosive-laden drones.",
      "El Chapo was sentenced to life plus 30 years and is serving time at a\u00a0Supermax prison\u00a0in Florence, Colorado. In 2023, the cartel leader\u00a0sent an \"SOS\"\u00a0through his lawyers to then-President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador for help due to alleged \"psychological torment\" he says he is suffering in prison.",

    "summary": "Chinese and Thai authorities have tried to crack down on violent criminal gangs running vast fraud operations in Myanmar's borderlands.",
    "story": [
      "China sentenced five people to death on Tuesday for their involvement in a violent criminal gang with fraud operations in Myanmar's Kokang region along the border, state media reported.",
      "Scam compounds have flourished in Myanmar's lawless borderlands, staffed by foreigners \u2014   many of them Chinese \u2014   who often say they were trafficked and forced to swindle people online, part of a multibillion-dollar illicit industry.",
      "Beijing has stepped up cooperation with Southeast Asian nations in recent months to crack down on the compounds, and thousands of people have been repatriated to China.",
      "The crimes of the five people sentenced Tuesday had led to the \"deaths of six Chinese nationals, one Chinese national's suicide and injuries to several others,\" official news agency Xinhua said, citing a court in the southern city of Shenzhen.",
      "\"The criminals were found to have built 41 compounds in the Kokang region,\" said Xinhua, adding that their activities included \"telecom fraud, operating gambling dens, intentional homicide, organizing and coercing prostitution (and) organizing others to illegally cross national borders.\"",
      "The Shenzhen court also handed two other defendants death sentences with two-year reprieves \u2014 a verdict that often results in life imprisonment.",
      "Five defendants were given life imprisonment, while sentences ranging from 3 to 20 years were given to nine others.",
      "In late September, a Chinese court issued death sentences to 16 members of a family-run gang with operations in Kokang \u2014 five with two-year reprieves.",
      "A growing, illegal international business",
      "The United Nations warned that Chinese and Southeast Asian gangs are raking in tens of billions of dollars a year through cyber scam centers.",
      "Sprawling compounds where internet tricksters target people with romance and business cons have thrived along Myanmar's loosely governed border during its civil war, which was sparked by a 2021 coup.",
      "While Myanmar's border region has been a hotbed of the illegal activity, the industry has spread to South America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and some Pacific Islands, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.",
      "A CBS News investigation just last year revealed the massive fraud operations targeting unsuspecting Americans from scam centers in Ghana, where young Ghanaians are lured into potentially lucrative lives of cyber fraud, but quickly become tools of transnational criminal syndicates that work in what's become a billion-dollar industry.",
      "The U.N. estimates that hundreds of thousands of people are working in scam centers globally, and the flourishing centers in Myanmar have drawn many workers from Southeast Asia as well as China.",
      "The Thai prime minister announced in late October that India would repatriate 500 of its citizens from Thailand after a crackdown on a Myanmar scam hub led to workers fleeing over the border.",
      "One of the most notorious hubs \u2014 KK Park \u2014   was roiled by apparent raids in late October, with hundreds of workers fleeing over the frontier river to the Thai town of Mae Sot.",
      "The upheaval followed an AFP investigation which this month revealed rapid construction at border scam centers, despite a much-publicized crackdown in February.",
      "More than 1,500 people from 28 countries crossed into Thailand during the raids on the KK Park facility, according to the administration of the Thai border province of Tak.",
      "\"Nearly 500 Indians are at Mae Sot,\" Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters on Oct. 29. \"The Indian government will send a plane to take them back directly.\"",
      "Many people staffing the fraud factories say they were trafficked into the hubs, although analysts say some workers also go willingly to secure attractive salary offers.",
      "In February, some workers who fled scam centers in Myanmar and made it across the border to Thailand told the Reuters news agency they were regularly beaten and tortured by their bosses.",
      "\"I  got a lot of punishments, like I receive shock, electric shock  every day. I received punch every day,\" Yotor, a 19-year-old Ethiopian who escaped one of the compounds, told Reuters. \"They just want to  punish us, and they punish us. Because, like, we were working for 18  hours without salary, without, like they did not allow us to contact our  family.\"",
      "Experts say Myanmar's military, which has ruled over the country since seizing power in the 2021 coup, has long turned a blind eye to the scam centers, profits from which are believed to go to its militia allies, who are crucial collaborators in their fight against rebels.",
      "But the junta has also faced pressure to shut down scam operations from its military backer China, irked at its citizens both participating in and being targeted by the scams.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The suit worn by Will Ferrell in the 2003 comedy hit \"Elf\" is going under the hammer at an auction of movie memorabilia in London this December, and the skin-tight green and yellow piece of Hollywood Christmas magic is expected to fetch over a quarter of a million dollars.",
      "Bidding for the iconic suit, complete with the conical hat and matching tunic, will begin at 50,000 pounds, the equivalent of about $65,000, but it's expected to eventually sell for as much as 200,000 pounds, or about $261,000, when the hammer falls at the Propstore Winter Entertainment Memorabilia auction.",
      "According to the description on the Propstore Auction house's website, there are tags reading \"Mr. Ferrell\" on the inside of the tunic and the stockings, with \"Hero-3\" also handwritten on the tunic tag.",
      "The auctioneers say the belt also has \"Mr. Ferrell\" written on it in blue ink.",
      "Large movie productions often create several versions of the same props, but the term \"hero\" is typically used to describe the highly detailed iterations which are central to the plot and intended for close-up shots in the final cut of the movie.",
      "The suit going up for sale does not appear to be the same one that Ferrell wore to an NHL hockey game in Los Angeles just after Christmas last year, when he gave fellow sports fans a giggle by sitting near the ice looking disgruntled with a beer and a cigarette in the garish outfit.",
      "Another notable item up for sale in the December auction is Marty McFly's iconic hoverboard from the second and third installations of the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, which is expected to sell for more than $156,000.",
      "According to the product description, it's the lightweight foam version of the prop, which actors used for scenes where their characters were seen carrying the boards, rather than a wooden version that Michael J. Fox and his fellow actors were seen riding in other parts of the movies.",
      "The example of the then-futuristic hoverboard does have some \"wear from use and age, including adhesive residue around the fastening strips, cracks in the foam, and paint chipping throughout,\" according to the auctioneers.",
      "The most valuable lot in the auction, however, will be the original prop used as Boba Fett's rifle in \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\"",
      "The auction house says it is the only known example of the prop. Other stunt versions and castings were made for later movies in the franchise, but, according to Propstore Auctions, this EE-3 carbine blaster has been \"identified by its serial number and photo-matched by details on the stock, directly confirming its provenance.\"",
      "The blaster, which started its life as a genuine 1917 Webley & Scott No.1 Mark I flare pistol, is expected to fetch the equivalent of around $915,000 when it goes under the hammer.",
      "The three day auction begins on Dec. 5 and will feature other iconic film memorabilia including Indiana Jones' fedora, worn by Harrison Ford in the 1984 \"Temple of Doom\" movie, Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightweight lightsaber from 1999's \"Phantom Menace,\" and Jack Nicholson's stunt axe from the horror classic \"The Shining.\"",

      "\"Under the new provision, individuals born on or after January 1, 2007 are prohibited from purchasing, using, or being sold tobacco products within the Maldives,\" it added.",

    "story": [
      "The Jamaican government on Monday said at least 32 deaths have been attributed to\u00a0Hurricane Melissa, with Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon saying there are possibly eight more unconfirmed deaths.",
      "With its tourism season just a month away, officials are rushing to rebuild from the\u00a0catastrophic Category 5 storm\u00a0that shredded the island's western region. Before the hurricane hit on Oct. 28, the government expected Jamaica's tourism industry to grow by 7% this winter season and was preparing to welcome an estimated 4.3 million visitors.",
      "Now, officials are scrambling to repair hotels and clear debris in the western half of the island in the hope of securing tourist dollars at a moment when they're needed most.",
      "Melissa was the most powerful hurricane to lash the island since record-keeping began 174 years ago. The National Hurricane Center said the storm initially came ashore near New Hope, on the southwestern coast of Jamaica.",
      "Before the storm, the Jamaican government said it had done all it could to prepare. \"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness had said.",
      "\"We are still doing our assessments, but most of the damage was in the northwest and southwest,\" said Christopher Jarrett, who leads the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association.",
      "He noted that the popular Negril area in Westmoreland was spared major damage.",
      "All international airports in Jamaica have reopened and are receiving commercial flights. But almost a week after\u00a0one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record\u00a0struck the western end of Jamaica, tourism officials were still trying to get a true picture of the damage to the sector \u2014 a mainstay of the island's economy.",
      "Jarrett said the lobby group that represents private hotels and attractions on the island is still unable to reach many of its members, especially in the western parish of Hanover, as communication and electricity services were down.",
      "\"Every individual member who was affected is doing everything to get back up and running,\" he said.",
      "In recent days, Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett said he expected Jamaica's tourism sector to be back to normal by Dec. 15, the start of the island's peak tourism season.",
      "\"It's doable for some and not for others,\" Jarrett said of the timeline, pointing out that the larger hotel chains would be able to recover quicker.",
      "Jarrett, who operates the family-owned Altamont Court Hotel that has properties in Kingston and Montego Bay, said only one property in Montego Bay sustained roof damage and that repairs were underway.",
      "Despite the disruption to the important tourism sector, Jarrett said he doesn't expect the economic fallout to be significant. He said many hotels in the capital of Kingston and in the northern coastal town of Ocho Rios were gaining business from the influx of aid workers and volunteers in the hurricane's aftermath.",
      "\"Right now, we're giving discounts, between 25% and 50%, and some [hotels] are giving complimentary stays as well,\" Jarrett said.",
      "Tourism is Jamaica's main source of foreign exchange earnings, contributing a combined 30% to gross domestic product directly and indirectly. It employs an estimated 175,000 people and is a major economic driver for other sectors in the Jamaican economy, such as construction, banking and finance, utilities and agriculture.",
      "The disruption to the tourism sector is also affecting many providers of goods and services.",
      "\"With some of the hotels closed and most of the tourists gone, many of us are left without work. This storm didn't just destroy buildings; it shattered jobs and incomes for many of us and our families,\" said Patricia Mighten, who works in the western parish of Hanover as a hotel housekeeper.",
      "Desrine Smith, a craft vendor who plies her trade in the resort town of Falmouth in the northwestern parish of Trelawny, echoed those sentiments.",
      "\"Going days without tourists coming to buy anything means no sales and no money. We survive on daily earnings, and now everything is uncertain,\" she said. \"The hurricane has impacted our pockets hard.\"",
      "Crews are still trying to access 25 isolated areas in western Jamaica as helicopters continue to drop food for them. Nearly half of all power customers remain without electricity.",

      "Evolving advice",
      "Before 2015, it was standard practice to caution parents about peanut exposure for children under 3 years of age. Then in 2015, a landmark study \u2014 the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial \u2014 sparked a change in clinical practice.",
      "The study found that for infants who had severe eczema or an egg allergy, exposing them to peanuts when they were between 4 and 11 months old could reduce peanut allergy risk by 81%.",

      "These effects can sometimes linger even after the person has recovered from the infection.

      "What's the deal with the proposed GUARD Act?",
      "Here are some of the key features of the proposed Guard Act:",
      "AI companies would be required to\u00a0verify user age with \"reasonable age-verification measures\" (for example, a government ID) rather than simply asking for a birthdate.If a user is found to be under 18, a company must\u00a0prohibit them from accessing an \"AI companion.\"The bill also mandates that\u00a0chatbots clearly disclose they are\u00a0not human and do not hold professional credentials (therapy, medical, legal) in every conversation.It creates new\u00a0criminal and civil penalties for companies that knowingly provide chatbots to minors that solicit or facilitate sexual content, self-harm or violence.",

      "It creates new\u00a0criminal and civil penalties for companies that knowingly provide chatbots to minors that solicit or facilitate sexual content, self-harm or violence.",
      "Bipartisan lawmakers, including Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal, introduced the GUARD Act to protect minors from unregulated AI chatbots. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The motivation: lawmakers cite testimony of parents, child welfare experts and growing lawsuits alleging that some chatbots manipulated minors, encouraged self-harm or worse. The basic framework of the GUARD Act is clear, but the details reveal how extensive its reach could be for tech companies and families alike.",
      "META AI DOCS EXPOSED, ALLOWING CHATBOTS TO FLIRT WITH KIDS",
      "Why is this such a big deal?",
      "This bill is more than another piece of tech regulation. It sits at the center of a growing debate over how far artificial intelligence should reach into children's lives.",
      "AI chatbots are no longer toys. Many kids are using them. Hawley cited\u00a0more than 70 percent of American children\u00a0engaging with these products. These chatbots can provide human-like responses, emotional mimicry and sometimes invite ongoing conversations. For minors, these interactions can blur boundaries between machine and human, and they may seek guidance or emotional connection from an algorithm rather than a real person.",
      "If this bill passes, it could reshape how the AI industry manages minors, age verification, disclosures and liability. It shows that Congress is ready to move away from voluntary self-regulation and toward firm guardrails when children are involved. The proposal may also open the door for similar laws in other high-risk areas, such as mental health bots and educational assistants. Overall, it marks a shift from waiting to see how AI develops to acting now to protect young users.",
      "Parents across the country are calling for stronger safeguards as more than 70 percent of children use AI chatbots that can mimic empathy and emotional support. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Some tech companies argue that such regulation could stifle innovation, limit beneficial uses of conversational AI (education, mental-health support for older teens) or impose heavy compliance burdens. This tension between safety and innovation is at the heart of the debate.",
      "What the GUARD Act requires from AI companies",
      "If passed, the GUARD Act would impose strict federal standards on how AI companies design, verify and manage their chatbots, especially when minors are involved. The bill outlines several key obligations aimed at protecting children and holding companies accountable for harmful interactions.",
      "The first major requirement centers on\u00a0age verification. Companies must use reliable methods such as government-issued identification or other proven tools to confirm that a user is at least 18 years old. Simply asking for a birthdate is no longer enough.The second rule involves\u00a0clear disclosures. Every chatbot must tell users at the start of each conversation, and at regular intervals, that it is an artificial intelligence system, not a human being. The chatbot must also clarify that it does not hold professional credentials such as medical, legal or therapeutic licenses.Another provision establishes an\u00a0access ban for minors. If a user is verified as under 18, the company must block access to any \"AI companion\" feature that simulates friendship, therapy or emotional communication.The bill also introduces\u00a0civil and criminal penalties for companies that violate these rules. Any chatbot that encourages or engages in sexually explicit conversations with minors, promotes self-harm or incites violence could trigger significant fines or legal consequences.Finally, the GUARD Act defines an\u00a0AI companion as a system designed to foster interpersonal or emotional interaction with users, such as friendship or therapeutic dialogue. This definition makes it clear that the law targets chatbots capable of forming human-like connections, not limited-purpose assistants.",

      "OHIO LAWMAKER PROPOSES COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON MARRYING AI SYSTEMS AND GRANTING LEGAL PERSONHOOD",
      "How to stay safe in the meantime",
      "Technology often moves faster than laws, which means families, schools and caregivers must take the lead in protecting young users right now. These steps can help create safer online habits while lawmakers debate how to regulate AI chatbots.",
      "Start by finding out which chatbots your kids talk to and what those bots are designed for. Some are made for entertainment or education, while others focus on emotional support or companionship. Understanding each bot's purpose helps you spot when a tool crosses from harmless fun into something more personal or manipulative.",
      "Even if a chatbot is labeled safe, decide together when and how it can be used. Encourage open communication by asking your child to show you their chats and explain what they like about them. Framing this as curiosity, not control, builds trust and keeps the conversation ongoing.",
      "Take advantage of built-in safety features whenever possible. Turn on parental controls, activate kid-friendly modes and block apps that allow private or unmonitored chats. Small settings changes can make a big difference in reducing exposure to harmful or suggestive content.",
      "Remind kids that even the most advanced chatbot is still software. It can mimic empathy, but does not understand or care in a human sense. Help them recognize that advice about mental health, relationships or safety should always come from trusted adults, not from an algorithm.",
      "Stay alert for changes in behavior that could signal a problem. If a child becomes withdrawn, spends long hours chatting privately with a bot or repeats harmful ideas, step in early. Talk openly about what is happening, and if necessary, seek professional help.",
      "Regulations such as the GUARD Act and new state measures, including California's SB 243, are still taking shape. Keep up with updates so you know what protections exist and which questions to ask app developers or schools. Awareness is the first line of defense in a fast-moving digital world.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The GUARD Act represents a bold step toward regulating the intersection of minors and AI chatbots. It reflects growing concern that unmoderated AI companionship might harm vulnerable users, especially children. Of course, regulation alone won't solve all problems, industry practices, platform design, parental involvement and education all matter. But this bill signals that the era of \"build it and see what happens\" for conversational AI may be ending when children are involved. As technology continues to evolve, our laws and our personal practices must evolve too. For now, staying informed, setting boundaries and treating chatbot interactions with the same scrutiny we treat human ones can make a real difference.",

      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "A new scam called ghost tapping is spreading across the country. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) warns that scammers are using this tactic to steal money from people who use tap-to-pay credit cards and mobile wallets.",
      "This scam exploits wireless technology to withdraw money without your awareness. Many victims only realize something is wrong after small, unnoticed transactions slowly drain their accounts.",

      "The Better Business Bureau warns of a new \"ghost-tapping\" scam draining money from tap-to-pay cards and mobile wallets. (Clara Margais/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "How the ghost-tapping scam works",
      "Scammers use near-field communication (NFC) devices that mimic legitimate tap-to-pay systems. In busy places such as festivals, markets, or public transportation, they move close enough to your wallet or phone to trigger a transaction.",
      "The BBB reports that some scammers pose as charity vendors or market sellers who only accept tap payments. Once you tap your card or phone, they charge far more than the agreed amount.",
      "Because the first few withdrawals are usually small, they often go undetected by fraud systems. Victims may not notice until much later, when more money has been taken.",
      "Real-life cases and warnings",
      "A Missouri resident reportedly lost $100 after being approached by a person carrying a handheld card reader. The BBB Scam Tracker has recorded many similar cases across the nation, with losses sometimes exceeding $1,000.",
      "Officials warn that scammers may pressure you to complete payments quickly, preventing you from verifying the amount or merchant name. Some even carry portable readers that can pick up signals through thin wallets or purses.",
      "How to protect yourself from ghost tapping",
      "While the threat of ghost tapping may sound alarming, protecting yourself is easier than you think. A few smart habits and security tools can greatly reduce your risk of falling victim.",
      "Invest in an RFID-blocking wallet or card sleeve to create a physical barrier between your card and potential scanners. These inexpensive tools prevent scammers from reading your card information through clothing, bags, or wallets. Look for sleeves or wallets specifically designed to block wireless communication.",
      "Always check the merchant name and transaction amount displayed on the payment terminal before tapping. Scammers often rush you to avoid scrutiny. Take an extra second to confirm what you see matches what you agreed to pay. If something looks off, cancel the transaction immediately.",
      "Enable instant transaction alerts from your bank or credit card provider. This lets you know the moment a payment is made, giving you a chance to spot unauthorized activity right away. Quick detection can prevent further charges and make it easier to dispute fraudulent transactions.",
      "Bonus protection: Even if you stop a scam early, your personal data can end up for sale online. Our No. 1 identity theft company monitors your credit and financial information, alerting you if your details appear on the dark web or in a data breach.",

      "The BBB says reports of \"ghost tapping\" are rising, with some victims losing more than $1,000 to contactless theft. (M. Scott Brauer/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Crowded environments such as festivals, public transportation, or street fairs create perfect conditions for scammers to blend in. Limit tap-to-pay use in these situations. Instead, use chip or swipe methods, which require physical contact and are harder to exploit.",
      "Make it a habit to check your financial accounts at least once a week. Review each transaction carefully and report anything suspicious to your bank immediately. Even small unexplained charges could signal a larger problem.",
      "Most mobile wallet apps allow you to set PINs, facial recognition, or fingerprint verification before authorizing a transaction. Make sure these protections are enabled. This adds another barrier that prevents criminals from initiating payments without your consent.",
      "Regularly update your smartphone's software and mobile wallet apps. Updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities scammers might exploit. Outdated software can leave your data exposed.",
      "Stay protected from payment-stealing malware:",
      "In addition to keeping your apps updated, protect your device from hidden threats with strong antivirus software. It scans for malicious apps and spyware that can hijack your tap-to-pay data or record sensitive information.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "While convenient, storing several cards in one app can increase your exposure if your phone is compromised. Keep only the cards you use most often connected to your mobile wallet. This reduces the impact of potential fraudulent activity.",
      "If you ever suspect ghost tapping or notice a strange charge, contact your bank immediately and report the scam to the BBB Scam Tracker. Quick action can help prevent additional losses and assist authorities in identifying scam trends.",

      "As contactless payments become more common, scammers are getting more creative. Staying informed and cautious can help protect your money. Small steps like checking your transaction history and using protective gear can make a big difference. If you notice unauthorized charges, contact your bank immediately, freeze your card and report the scam to the BBB Scam Tracker. Technology offers convenience but can also create new risks. The ghost-tapping scam shows how quickly and easily payments can invite hidden dangers. Awareness and prevention remain the best ways to keep your finances safe.",

      "YOUR PHONE IS TRACKING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT\u2019S NOT",
      "Step one: Find the built-in mic switch",
      "Before opening menus, check your TV's frame. Many models feature a small hardware switch that turns the microphone off completely.",
      "Look closely along the bottom or sides of your screen. Some switches are labeled \"Built-in MIC.\" On Samsung TVs, it's often near the bottom right edge when facing the screen.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "A security researcher found a serious weakness in the software that powers thousands of e-commerce sites. The platform, called Magento, and its paid version Adobe Commerce, has a bug that lets attackers break into active shopping sessions. Some attackers can even take control of the entire store.",
      "The flaw is known as SessionReaper. It allows hackers to pretend they are real customers without needing a password. Once they are inside, they can steal data, make fake orders, or install tools that collect credit card details.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "Why is this attack so serious?",
      "The problem starts in the part of the system that handles how a store communicates with other online services. Because the software does not properly check the information it receives, it sometimes trusts data that it should not. Hackers take advantage of this by sending fake session files that the store accepts as real.",
      "Researchers at SecPod warn that successful attacks can lead to stolen customer data, fake purchases and even full control of the store's server.",
      "Once the attack method was shared publicly, cybercriminals began using it right away. Security experts at Sansec reported that more than 250 online stores were compromised within a single day. This shows how quickly attacks can spread once a vulnerability becomes public.",
      "Hackers are exploiting a new flaw called SessionReaper to hijack active shopping sessions on thousands of e-commerce sites running Adobe Commerce and Magento. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Why are many stores still unprotected?",
      "Adobe released a security update on Sept. 9 to fix the issue. Weeks later, about 62% of affected stores still have not installed it. Some store owners are afraid an update might break features on their site. Others simply do not know how serious the risk is.",
      "Every unpatched store remains an open door for attackers who want to steal information or install malicious code.",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "How can you stay safe when shopping online?",
      "While store owners are responsible for fixing the problem, you can still take smart steps to protect yourself when shopping online. These actions can help you spot danger early and keep your personal information safe.",
      "Always pay attention to how a website behaves. If a page looks odd, loads slowly or shows error messages, it could mean something is wrong behind the scenes. Check for the small padlock symbol in the address bar that shows the site uses HTTPS encryption. If it is missing or the site redirects you to an unfamiliar page, stop and close the browser tab immediately. Trust your instincts if something feels off.",
      "Cybercriminals often use fake promotional emails or ads that look like real store offers. Instead of clicking links in messages or banners, type the store's web address directly into your browser to avoid phishing pages designed to steal your login details or card information. Since attacks like SessionReaper can expose your personal data to criminal marketplaces, consider using a reputable data removal service that continuously scans and deletes your private information, such as your address, phone number and email, from data broker sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft if your information has been leaked through a compromised online store.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Cybersecurity teams at SecPod and Sansec tracked more than 250 stores breached within 24 hours of the exploit going public, showing how fast these attacks spread. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Strong antivirus protection is your silent guard online. Choose reputable software that offers real-time protection, safe browsing alerts and automatic updates. A strong antivirus program can detect malicious code that tries to run on your device, block unsafe sites and alert you to potential threats. This adds another crucial layer of defense when visiting online stores that may not be fully secure.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Whenever possible, choose payment services that add an extra layer of protection between your bank account and the online store. Platforms like PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay do not share your card number with the retailer. This reduces the chance of your information being stolen if the store is compromised. These payment gateways also offer dispute protection if a purchase turns out to be fraudulent.",
      "Stick to stores with a solid reputation. Well-known brands usually have better security and faster response times when issues arise. Before buying from a new website, check its reviews on trusted consumer sites. Look for signs of credibility such as clear contact information, a professional design and verified payment options. A few minutes of research can save you from weeks of frustration.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Updates may seem annoying, but they are one of the most effective ways to protect your data. Make sure your computer, smartphone and web browser all have the latest security patches installed. Updates often fix the exact kinds of flaws hackers use to spread attacks like SessionReaper. Enable automatic updates if you can, so your devices stay protected without extra effort.",
      "If you create accounts on shopping sites, make sure each one has its own strong password. Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms. Consider using a password manager to generate and store long, random passwords. That way, if one account is compromised, your other logins stay safe.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "If a site or payment service offers\u00a0two-factor authentication, enable it. This adds a second security step, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an app. Even if hackers steal your password, they will not be able to access your account without that second verification.",
      "Even weeks after Adobe issued a critical patch for the SessionReaper vulnerability, nearly two-thirds of affected online stores remain unprotected, leaving customer data and payment information at high risk of theft. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Public Wi-Fi networks\u00a0in places like caf\u00e9s, airports and hotels are often unsecured. Avoid entering payment information or logging in to accounts while connected to public networks. If you must make a purchase while away from home, use a mobile data connection or a reliable VPN to encrypt your activity.",
      "Check your financial statements regularly for any unusual activity. Small, unauthorized charges can be early signs of fraud. Report any suspicious transactions to your bank or credit card company right away so they can freeze your account or issue a new card.",
      "If you notice anything strange during or after an online purchase, act quickly. Contact the store's customer service to report what you saw. You should also inform your payment provider or credit card company so they can block unauthorized transactions. Reporting early can help stop further damage and alert other shoppers to potential risks.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The SessionReaper attack shows how fast online threats can appear and how long they can linger when updates are ignored. Even well-known stores can become unsafe overnight. For retailers, installing patches quickly is critical. For shoppers, staying alert and choosing secure payment methods are the best ways to stay protected.",

The clear web is the open part of the internet that search engines like Google or Bing can index, including news sites, blogs, stores and public pages. Beneath it lies the deep web, which includes pages not meant for public indexing, such as corporate intranets, private databases and webmail portals. Most of the content in the deep web is legal but simply restricted to specific users.",
      "The dark web, however, is where anonymity and illegality intersect. It requires special software such as Tor to access, and much of its activity happens behind encryption and invitation-only walls. Tor, short for The Onion Router, was originally developed by the U.S. Navy for secure communication but has since become a haven for both privacy advocates and criminals.",
      "It anonymizes users by routing traffic through multiple encrypted layers, making it almost impossible to trace where a request truly came from. This anonymity allows criminals to communicate, sell data and conduct illegal trade with reduced risk of exposure.",
      "Over time, the dark web has become a hub for criminal commerce. Marketplaces once operated like eBay for illegal goods, offering everything from drugs and stolen credit card data to hacking tools and fake identities. Many of these platforms have been shut down, but the trade continues on smaller, more private channels, including encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. Vendors use aliases, ratings and escrow systems to build credibility.",
      "Ironically, even among criminals, trust is a critical part of business. Forums often have administrators, verified sellers and mediators to settle disputes. Members who cheat others or fail to deliver are quickly blacklisted, and reputation becomes the main currency that determines who can be trusted.",
      "The criminal economy and how scams are born",
      "Every major cyberattack or data leak often traces back to the dark web's underground economy. A single attack typically involves several layers of specialists. It begins with information stealers, malware designed to capture credentials, cookies and device fingerprints from infected machines. The stolen data is then bundled and sold in dark web markets by data suppliers. Each bundle, known as a log, might contain login credentials, browser sessions and even authentication tokens, often selling for less than $20.",
      "Another group of criminals, known as initial access brokers, purchases these logs to gain entry into corporate systems. With that access, they can impersonate legitimate users and bypass security measures such as multi-factor authentication by mimicking the victim's usual device or browser. Once inside, these brokers sometimes auction their access to larger criminal gangs or ransomware operators who are capable of exploiting it further.",
      "Some of these auctions are run as competitions, while others are flash sales where well-funded groups can buy access immediately without bidding. Eventually, this chain of transactions ends with a ransomware attack or an extortion demand, as attackers encrypt sensitive data or threaten to leak it publicly.",
      "Interestingly, even within these illegal spaces, scams are common. New vendors often post fake listings for stolen data or hacking tools, collect payments and disappear. Others impersonate trusted members or set up counterfeit escrow services to lure buyers.",
      "Despite all the encryption and reputation systems, no one is truly safe from fraud, not even the criminals themselves. This constant cycle of deception forces dark web communities to build internal rules, verification processes and penalties to keep their operations somewhat functional.",
      "What you can do to stay ahead of dark web-driven threats",
      "For ordinary people and businesses, understanding how these networks operate is key to preventing their effects. Many scams that appear in your inbox or on social media originate from credentials or data first stolen and sold on the dark web. That is why basic digital hygiene goes a long way. Below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "One of the easiest ways to stay safe online is to use unique, complex passwords for every account you own. Many breaches happen because people reuse the same password across multiple services. When one site is hacked, cybercriminals take those leaked credentials and try them elsewhere, a technique known as credential stuffing. A password manager eliminates this problem by generating strong, random passwords and securely storing them for you.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Antivirus software remains one of the most effective ways to detect and block malicious programs before they can steal your information. Modern antivirus solutions do far more than just scan for viruses. They monitor system behavior, detect phishing attempts and prevent infostealer malware from sending your credentials or personal data to attackers.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Outdated software is one of the biggest entry points for attackers. Cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems, browsers and plugins to deliver malware or gain access to systems. Installing updates as soon as they are available is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of defense. Enable automatic updates for your operating system, browsers and critical applications.",
      "Even if your password gets leaked or stolen,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional barrier for attackers. With 2FA, logging in requires both your password and a secondary verification method. This includes code from an authentication app or a hardware security key.",
      "Identity theft protection can provide early warnings if your personal information appears in data breaches or on dark web marketplaces. These services monitor your sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, bank details or email addresses. If anything suspicious is detected, they alert you. Many providers also offer recovery assistance, helping you restore stolen identities or close fraudulent accounts. While no service can prevent identity theft entirely, these tools can shorten your response time and limit potential damage if your data is compromised.",

      "Starcloud aims to build the first orbital data centers, cutting emissions and speeding up global computing. (Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)",
      "Why space data centers matter for the future",
      "Every time you send a message, store a file in the cloud or use AI, large computers on Earth handle the work. These data centers use massive amounts of electricity and water to stay cool. They also release heat, noise and greenhouse gases that affect local communities.",
      "Space offers a different environment. Solar energy is abundant, and cooling happens naturally in the cold vacuum.\u00a0\"The only environmental cost is the launch,\" said Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston.\u00a0\"After that, we could save ten times the carbon emissions compared with running data centers on Earth.\"",
      "For a world searching for greener technology, that goal matters.",
      "How the NVIDIA GPU will work in orbit",
      "The Starcloud-1 satellite, about the size of a small refrigerator, will carry NVIDIA's H100 GPU. It is nearly one hundred times more powerful than any chip ever sent into orbit.",
      "Once in space, the GPU will process huge amounts of satellite data. It will study images of Earth to identify wildfires, track crops and monitor weather. Normally, satellites send this data back to Earth for processing, which can cause long delays. Doing the analysis in orbit allows faster results and better decisions on the ground.",

      "Starcloud hopes this is only the beginning. The company plans to build larger data centers in space powered by sunlight and cooled by the natural chill of orbit. Future systems will include the next generation of NVIDIA GPUs called Blackwell, which promise even higher performance.",
      "Starcloud's long-term goal is to create a five-gigawatt orbital data center about 2.5 miles wide (around 13,000 feet across). It could handle massive AI workloads while cutting costs and carbon emissions. As launch prices continue to fall, building data centers beyond Earth could soon become practical.",
      "Johnston believes that by the 2030s, many new data centers will operate in orbit instead of on land.",
      "What this space mission means for you",
      "If this works, the technology that powers your apps, games and AI tools might soon be running in space. This change could make cloud services faster, more efficient and less harmful to the planet.",

      "Nike has taken a bold step into the future with Project Amplify, the world's first motor-powered footwear system made for people who love to move. Created with robotics partner Dephy, the design combines a carbon-plated running shoe with a motorized cuff and drive belt that add a gentle push to every stride.",
      "Unlike performance tech built for pros, Project Amplify is designed for everyday movers such as runners, walkers and commuters. It helps anyone who wants to go a little faster and a little farther with less effort. Think of it like the running world's version of an e-bike. It makes movement simpler, smoother and more fun for everyone.",

According to testers, the system makes uphill running feel like flat ground. Some even said it helped them go from a 12-minute mile to a 10-minute mile with less effort.",
      "NIKE IS NOW ON AMAZON: SHOP WALKING SHOES, JOGGERS, SOCKS AND SHORTS TODAY",

      "HUMANOID ROBOT TURNS HEADS AT NYC SNEAKER STORE",
      "That question inspired years of research and collaboration between Nike and Dephy. Together, they combined robotics, biomechanics and motion algorithms to create a powered shoe that feels natural to wear.",
      "Like e-bikes transformed cycling, Project Amplify could do the same for running and walking. It aims to help people stay active more often and enjoy movement in new ways. Through this approach, Nike is showing how innovation can make fitness more accessible to everyone.",

      "For casual runners, this means more miles with less strain. For commuters, it could make daily travel faster and more efficient. Overall, it gives you the power to enjoy movement again. The goal is not to do less. The goal is to get more from every step.",

      "DNA lab Othram speaks with Fox News Digital about how genetic genealogy pinpointed Bryan Kohberger as a suspect in the 2022 Idaho murders case investigation. (Julia Bonavita/Fox News Digital)",
      "Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson admitted to a major miscalculation in what the University of Idaho victims' families should be owed in restitution, telling a judge Wednesday that he would no longer be seeking roughly $27,000 in travel expenses that were not outlined in Bryan Kohberger's plea deal \u2014 asking the court to award about a tenth of that in funeral expenses instead.",
      "Kohberger's lawyers noted that the travel expenses were not part of the plea deal after Thompson mistakenly thought they would be covered by a victims' compensation fund and agreed that the funeral expenses amount to $3,075.58. However, they argued Kohberger still shouldn't have to pay.",
      "Judge Steven Hippler grilled attorney Elisa Massoth about the terms of the deal and why Kohberger shouldn't have to live up to them. He ended the hearing without issuing a decision, which is expected to come later in writing.",
      "The judge also revealed that Kohberger had already received a \"five-figure\" donation to his jail funds. Massoth claimed that it was mostly for communication purposes, although the cost of sending a message at Kohberger's former jail is just a few cents at a time.",

      "A plea deal is essentially a contract, Hippler said, and as a result, the prosecution can't seek restitution for travel expenses outside the terms of the deal.",
      "However, he also rejected claims from the defense that Kohberger has no potential future income. There was the unspecified \"five-figure\" donation, he said, and Kohberger or a relative could potentially profit off of his story in a movie, book or TV deal.",
      "\"There's no way that BK is ever going to profit from any sort of movie or book because Idaho\u2026specifically precludes that,\" Massoth countered.",
      "Hippler said that's not exactly how the law works. Money earned from such a deal would be earmarked to cover debts to the victims if it existed, he said.",
      "\"If there's no debt for those certain things, does the money not go then to the defendant?\" he asked.",
      "\"That's not my reading of the code,\" Massoth said.",

      "His defense had previously said he shouldn't have to pay up since the victims' families received money from donors on GoFundMe.",
      "Prosecutors, however, counter that he has \"a history\" of receiving \"compensation\" from his family and unidentified third parties while behind bars \u2014 money they say should go toward the victims' families.",
      "At issue was roughly $27,000 to be split between the parents of Kaylee Goncalves, 21, and the mother of Madison Mogen, her 21-year-old best friend, to cover travel and other expenses incurred during Kohberger's case.",

      "The sources of Kohberger's prison funds are not immediately clear, but throughout his case, supporters have claimed to have sent money to his commissary in posts on social media.",
      "Prosecutors filed his jailhouse financial history under seal.",
      "Paul Mauro, a retired NYPD inspector and Fox News contributor who has been following the case, said some of the money could be coming from female supporters, but large sums could come from media outlets seeking exclusive interviews.",
      "Kohberger has never told his story, and told the judge he would \"respectfully decline,\" when given the opportunity to speak at his sentencing.",
      "He said it's not unrealistic to think that someone would offer Kohberger between five and six figures to break his silence.",
      "If Kohberger does eventually speak out, he likely will not be able to profit, Fox News Digital reported previously. Like New York's 1977 \"Son of Sam\" law, Idaho has legislation that helps prevent criminals from making money through detailing their offenses.",
      "According to Idaho law, if a criminal signs a deal to profit from telling their crime story \u2014 including through a movie, book or magazine article \u2014 the profits first go to the state treasurer to be sent to an escrow account. Victims or their families, who must be notified, can claim the money through civil lawsuits within five years.",
      "As part of his plea deal to avoid the death penalty, Kohberger agreed to pay more than $250,000 in criminal fines and fees plus another $20,000 in civil judgments to each victim's family.",
      "His lawyers argued last month that he shouldn't have to pay another roughly $20,000 to Goncalves' parents or nearly $7,000 more to Mogen's mother, Karen Laramie, in travel and accommodation expenses requested by the prosecution.",

Following the government of Israel\u2019s initial allegations in January of 2024 of potential UNRWA staff misconduct, Commissioner-General Lazzarini immediately terminated the appointments of the named staff \u2018in the interest of the Agency,\u2019 to protect UNRWA\u2019s ability to deliver humanitarian assistance.\"",
      "Deere claimed that, \"regrettably, since that time the government of Israel has failed to provide the United States, the United Nations, or UNRWA with the information and evidence that would substantiate its claims against UNRWA employees. Significantly, the government of Israel has also failed to take action against any of the named individuals in their own judicial system. The record is clear, UNRWA investigates every claim brought to it of potential employee misconduct, as evidenced by the multiple requests the agency has made to the Israeli government for the information in these cases.\"",

They are a subsidiary of Hamas.\"",
      "A report on Monday by the Washington Free Beacon said a confidential copy of the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) report on UNRWA members\u2019 participation in the Oct. 7 attack claimed to show that OIOS dismissed the evidence provided by Israeli intelligence of intercepted calls between Hamas personnel and UNRWA staff as \"likely authentic\" but \"insufficient\" proof of cooperation to support the firing of 10 additional UNRWA employees. Additionally, the report said that the U.N. \"did not investigate ties to Hamas outside participation in the Oct. 7 attacks.\"",
      "Foundation for Defense of Democracies Senior Advisor Richard Goldberg told Fox News Digital that \"UNRWA was Hamas in Gaza. It remains a terror and radicalization threat elsewhere. When Israel banned UNRWA in Gaza, it was quickly replaced by other U.N. agencies and NGOs. UNRWA proved neither indispensable nor irreplaceable \u2014 a lie repeated by many.\"",
      "\"We also need to dismantle the entire agency in the context of deradicalization,\" Goldberg said. \"Oct. 7 will keep happening again and again so long as UNRWA exists.

UNRWA was complicit in Oct. 7 and is unfit for purpose. Our policy is that it will not play a role in Gaza again.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump delivered a speech on the economy to business leaders in Miami on Wednesday, one day after Republicans suffered brutal election losses in states where exit polls showed voters deeply concerned about financial issues.",
      "While the president has started to acknowledge that economic anxiety \u2014 including over the government shutdown \u2014 is hurting Republicans politically, his address to the American Business Forum largely hyped his economic agenda.",
      "\u201cThis is the golden age of America,\u201d Trump said opening his campaign-style remarks, which even featured the song \"Y.M.C.A.\" \u2014 a staple of his election rallies.",
      "Trump focused much of his time on what he views as three positive economic indicators: the stock market hitting record highs, wages ticking up and an easier environment for American-born workers to find jobs.",
      "\u201cAlmost 2 million American-born workers are employed today more than when I took office,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump also said any economic slump is due to a \"transition period\" needed for his economic policies to really take hold, and \u2014 without evidence \u2014 boasted that there has been $18 trillion in investment made in the country since he returned to office, a number that has been debunked in the past.",
      "Trump's speech, however, frequently weaved away from the economy.",
      "He returned to attacks against his political opponents, going after former President Joe Biden for using an autopen and the new presidential library of former President Barack Obama, and he tried out nicknames for Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, saying he should be called \"Slimy Newscum.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s upbeat remarks at the Miami event largely did not reflect the increasingly difficult economic and political environment for his party.",
      "On Tuesday night, Democrats swept almost every high-profile race across the country during off-year elections seen as a testing ground for the 2026 midterms, when Republicans will try to hold onto slim majorities in the House and Senate.",
      "Though Trump did not put much direct effort into any of the races, his shadow loomed large over polling places across the country. Exit polling data showed that in each of the four states with significant elections \u2014 Virginia, New York, California and New Jersey \u2014 at least 55% of voters said they \u201cdisapprove\u201d of Trump\u2019s performance during his first 100 days in office.",
      "It\u2019s the latest in a flurry of data that show much of that disapproval is tied to the economy, which Trump has tried to rewire with his across-the-board tariffs and a more than $4-trillion tax cut package.",
      "An NBC News poll released on Sunday showed that just 34% of voters think he has \u201clived up\u201d to expectations on the economy, while 52% blamed Trump and Republicans in Congress for the government shutdown, which has gone on for 36 days and is now the longest in the nation\u2019s history.",
      "The legality of Trump\u2019s unilaterally imposed tariff regime was also the subject of a much-awaited Supreme Court hearing Wednesday, where administration attorneys were greeted by justices who seemed skeptical of arguments that Trump had the legal authority to impose sweeping tariffs under a federal law designed for national emergencies.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts said that the tariffs amount to a tax \u2014 an argument the administration has vocally rejected \u2014 and said the power of taxation is the responsibility of Congress.",
      "Ahead of Wednesday's hearing, attorneys for the federal government argued that the Trump-imposed tariffs would \u201cgenerate between $2.3 trillion and $3.3 trillion.\u201d But when pressed during the hearing, Solicitor General D. John Sauer seemingly contradicted that argument, telling justices that they were not designed to raise revenue but rather \u201cregulatory tariffs\u201d designed to help Trump cut trade deals.",
      "If the court rules that Trump did not act lawfully when he unilaterally imposed the tariffs, it could spin off even further economic uncertainty.",
      "Trump does appear to finally be sensing some political trouble, showing a rare bit of reflection during a breakfast Wednesday morning with Republican senators.",
      "Trump acknowledged that the government shutdown is being blamed on Republicans more than Democrats, and said his party, which controls both the House and Senate, needs to reopen the government or face further political backlash.",
      "He also appeared to express some concern that \"countless public servants are now not being paid, and the air traffic control system is under increasing strain\" \u2014 a notable shift in rhetoric from his frequent criticisms and digs at federal workers, whom his administration targeted for layoffs and suggested might not be entitled to post-shutdown pay.",
      "Trump has been pushing senators to pursue the \"nuclear option\" of scrapping the legislative filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes to pass most legislation out of that chamber. Lawmakers have so far rejected that drastic measure.",
      "\u201cIf you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans,\u201d Trump said Wednesday morning. \u201cLast night, it was not expected to be a victory, it was a very Democrat areas. I don\u2019t think it was good for Republicans. I don\u2019t think it was good for anybody. We had an interesting evening and learned a lot.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to get the country open,\u201d he added.",
      "Vice President JD Vance wrote on social media Wednesday that it was \"idiotic\" to read too much into Tuesday's election losses, since the contests took place in blue-leaning states. But even he admitted Republicans need to do more on the economy and said the outcome will be critical to the party's future in the midterms.",
      "\"The president has done a lot that has already paid off in lower interest rates and lower inflation, but we inherited a disaster from Joe Biden and Rome wasn't built in a day,\" he said. \"We're going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that's the metric by which we'll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond.\""

      "Even as they caution there are limits to how much these Democratic victories in several blue-leaning areas can translate into 2026 midterm elections on far more competitive turf, some Republicans are sounding the alarm.",
      "\u201cIt was a bloodbath. It\u2019s a disastrous night for Republicans in the state, and I think nationally folks should probably heed some warnings as well,\u201d said Mike DuHaime, a longtime New Jersey GOP strategist and former Republican National Committee political director. \u201cIt shows there\u2019s some discontent certainly with the current administration and it shows that candidates and campaigns matter as well.\u201d",
      "Here are six big takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s campaigns \u2014 and what they mean for Trump, the midterms and more.",
      "Democrats worked to make Trump an issue in their races, and it worked.",
      "New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger blamed Trump for voters\u2019 economic woes, while proponents of California\u2019s Proposition 50 framed their redistricting campaign as a way to push back on the president.",
      "Across all three states, exit polls show the president was a factor for a majority of voters, with most saying they saw their ballot as a way to oppose Trump.",
      "Spanberger and Sherrill won virtually all of the nearly 40% of voters in their states who saw their votes as a way to oppose Trump. In California, a majority of voters said the main reason for their proposition vote was to oppose Trump, and almost all of them supported the proposition.",
      "\u201cThis couldn\u2019t be a louder rebuke of Trump and Republicans,\u201d Democratic National Committee Executive Director Libby Schneider said in an interview. \u201cSo it\u2019s sort of a new day for Democrats tomorrow, but we\u2019re going to get right back to fighting.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, more than 60% of voters in New Jersey and Virginia also said they were \u201cdissatisfied or angry\u201d about the way things are going in the country. Out of that group, 77% said they voted for Spanberger and 75% backed Sherrill.",
      "A majority of Virginia voters (56%) said cuts to the federal government this year affected their family\u2019s finances either a lot or a little, and two-thirds of those voters broke for Spanberger. And majorities across both Virginia and New Jersey said the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement has gone too far, with the Democratic nominees winning about 90% of those who feel that way.",
      "Spanberger, Sherrill and Democrat Zohran Mamdani, who won the New York mayoral race, were all rewarded for making affordability and economic issues the center of the campaigns. Their victories came as voters have expressed deep dissatisfaction with Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, as outlined in the new NBC News poll released Sunday.",
      "National Democrats had largely seen the races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia as a key test of their candidates\u2019 focus on economic issues, after struggling on the issue in 2024, when Democrats controlled the White House and were seen as \u201cowning\u201d an unsteady economy.",
      "\u201cDemocrats win when we make it about what\u2019s going on at the local mall, not on the national mall,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist and veteran of Virginia campaigns.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s results in Virginia and New Jersey showed that \u201cpeople think Trump has made life harder and more expensive,\u201d Ferguson continued, adding that, \u201cOur candidates win \u2014 and can win big \u2014 when they show they\u2019re not part of that problem but the solution.\u201d",
      "The economy proved to be a top concern among Democratic voters, according to the NBC News Exit Poll. Nearly half of Virginia voters said it was the most important issue facing the state. Of those who said the economy was the most important issue, 59% supported Spanberger, while 39% backed GOP Lt. Gov Winsome Earle-Sears.",
      "While Republican Jack Ciattarelli won New Jersey voters who said taxes are the most important issue facing the state, Sherrill also won voters who said the top issue is the economy.",
      "Mamdani-style progressivism and the more centrist model of the Democratic Party embodied by Spanberger and Sherrill painted different pictures in these elections. But Democratic consultant Sam Cornale, a former top official at the Democratic National Committee, said it would be a mistake to read Tuesday\u2019s results as a \u201cfork in the road\u201d that forces his party to choose between different directions.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s what connects the winning Democratic campaigns that illuminates a single path for the party, he said, pointing to a tone of optimism that articulates a policy vision on issues like affordability \u2014 rather than simply attacking Trump \u2014 and the tactics of taking a message into politically hostile turf.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how they\u2019ve campaigned,\u201d Cornale said. \u201cThat\u2019s the model.\u201d",
      "Tuesday\u2019s elections also effectively kicked off next year\u2019s battle for control of Congress.",
      "California voters green-lit a new congressional map that could help Democrats flip up to five U.S. House seats from the state, a major victory for Democrats that helps to counter Republican redistricting efforts in other states.",
      "Democratic victories in Virginia \u2014 both at the statewide level and in expanding their majority in the state House \u2014 keep the party\u2019s hopes of redrawing the congressional maps there alive, too.",
      "And the three victories in Pennsylvania to retain Democratic-backed state Supreme Court justices retain the party\u2019s edge on the court, which has decided a handful of high-profile election-related cases in recent years.",
      "More broadly, the results also provide other clues of what the state of play will be in key states and districts ahead of next year\u2019s major elections.",
      "Beyond the marquee races, for example, Democrats got more good news down the ballot in Georgia, where the party won two statewide elections for the state\u2019s Public Service Commission in what the Atlanta Journal-Constitution notes were the first Democratic victories in statewide, nonfederal elections in almost 20 years.",
      "Meanwhile, while Mamdani\u2019s victory in New York marked a historic night for the Democrats, some Republicans are hopeful that they\u2019ve found a new bogeyman to energize their voters \u2014 a strategy that could spread to key House districts in the New York area and beyond next year.",
      "Republicans continue to have trouble getting Trump\u2019s supporters to vote when he is not on the ballot.",
      "\u201cTrying to be Donald Trump in a state that he lost is not enough, even if you execute the strategy,\u201d said DuHaime, the New Jersey Republican strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to put together Trump\u2019s coalition. It is unique to Trump.\u201d",
      "Trump made big gains in the Garden State in 2024 compared to his 2020 loss, performing better in working-class communities and more diverse parts of the state, including heavily Latino counties.",
      "But Ciattarelli struggled to replicate that coalition, even with Trump\u2019s endorsement.",
      "While Ciattarelli had a 7-point lead among voters without college degrees, Sherrill won voters making less than $100,000 and young men. Sherrill also appeared to easily win Latino voters, based on exit polling. She is heading for double-digit leads in heavily Latino counties including Passaic, which Trump flipped in 2024.",
      "Trump did not campaign with Ciattarelli in person, but he did hold a pair of tele-rallies. And Ciattarelli did not distance himself from the president.",
      "While Mamdani ran far to the left of Spanberger and Sherrill, all three fit their races.",
      "Spanberger and Sherrill provided lessons about \u201cwinning in this era,\u201d Ferguson said, especially as it pertains to swing and independent voters, while Mamdani\u2019s win should teach the party about \u201ccommunicating in this moment.\u201d According to the exit polls, the gubernatorial contenders\u2019 personal favorability was better than the Democratic Party\u2019s.",
      "Meanwhile, despite all the headwinds favoring Spanberger in Virginia, outgoing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin still received high marks in exit polls. But Earle-Sears, his lieutenant governor, couldn\u2019t replicate his 2021 winning coalition.",
      "\u201cWinsome wasn\u2019t able to capitalize,\u201d said Zack Roday, a Virginia-based Republican strategist. \u201cOnly strong candidates and relentless campaigns can even hope to seize the common-sense mantle like Trump and Youngkin have done so effectively.\u201d",
      "Though Mamdani ran a strong campaign in his own right, with his finger on the pulse of an electorate that was deeply concerned about cost of living, there was another important ingredient in his victory: His top opponents were hamstrung by serious personal baggage.",
      "Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, his main rival, resigned the governorship in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations. Mayor Eric Adams faced a corruption indictment and then had it dropped by the Trump administration, which soured his political standing in a deep-blue city.",
      "One of the most telling data points from Tuesday\u2019s elections was that Democrat Jay Jones won his race for Virginia attorney general \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t close.",
      "Just weeks earlier, Jones\u2019 campaign seemed doomed after reporting revealed violent texts from 2022 in which he suggested that Virginia\u2019s then-Republican House speaker get \u201ctwo bullets to the head.\u201d Another text from Jones discussed violence against that lawmaker\u2019s children.",
      "But partisanship trumped past transgressions. About 8-in-10 voters who called those texts disqualifying voted for Miyares, and almost the same share of voters who felt the texts were not a concern voted for Jones, the NBC News Exit Poll shows.",
      "Democratic voters told NBC News ahead of Election Day that while they strongly objected to the texts, they voted for Jones anyway to give Spanberger an ally to help achieve her policy goals.",
      "Then there\u2019s California, and the curious case of voters tut-tutting about partisan redistricting \u2014 while approving partisan redistricting.",
      "Fully 92% of California voters said a nonpartisan commission should draw each state\u2019s congressional district lines. Yet a majority voted to approve the new maps that sidestepped the independent redistricting commission."

    "story": [
      "CHICAGO \u2014 The first thing that hit Sarah Parise was an unfamiliar, pungent smell.",
      "She looked down at her ginger-haired 2-year-old, Leia, who was taking a turn pushing her own stroller near a grassy field where they had stopped to play on a Saturday morning walk.",
      "Then, it kicked in.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden, my eyes were just burning and I couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d Parise said.",
      "Leia began to scream: \u201cMommy! Mommy! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!\u201d",
      "Parise quickly put Leia in her stroller. She ran as fast as she could down the wide streets of her Old Irving Park neighborhood, past the towering trees with their leaves full of fall color. As she struggled with her own breathing, Leia wailed in pain and terror.",
      "As Parise raced home, she heard whistles and cars honking, she said. She saw a blur of armed men dressed in fatigues. Multiple reports from that day, Oct. 25, detailed how Border Patrol agents conducting immigration enforcement in the neighborhood confronted residents, leading a federal judge to question an official in court over the use of tear gas there \u201cwithout any warning.\u201d",
      "Nearly a week later, with a lingering sting in her throat, Parise recounted to NBC News the fear she and her daughter experienced as a result.",
      "Parise and more than a half-dozen neighbors underscored in interviews that federal agents have been the catalyst for chaos and clashes. They said that despite President Donald Trump\u2019s depiction of Chicago as a \u201cwar zone,\u201d the biggest disturbance or encounter with violence that they have witnessed in their neighborhood was not from criminals \u2014 but when immigration agents swept through.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know what happens when a 2-year-old \u2014 they\u2019re so little and their little lungs and everything \u2014 gets tear gas in them? And it\u2019s on you?\u201d Parise said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a ton of what was going on, because my only thing in my mind was like, \u2018I have to get home, and we have to get this rinsed off.\u2019\u201d",
      "That day, Parise said, she blew through her front door as her husband stared on, startled. She shouted \u201cWe just got hit with tear gas!\u201d and headed to the bathroom, where she rinsed her daughter repeatedly, then herself, with water. When that didn\u2019t work, she said, she doused them with milk.",
      "Parise showed a selfie she snapped of herself that day, wrapped in a towel, eyes red with tears, face scrunched in pain.",
      "Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that the actions in Old Irving Park resulted in the arrest of one \u201ccriminal illegal alien from Mexico, who has previously been arrested for assault.\u201d She added, in part, \u201cTo safely clear the area after multiple warnings and the crowd continuing to advance on them, Border Patrol had to deploy crowd control measures.\u201d",
      "As Parise worries over her 2-year-old suffering from the effects of a chemical agent deployed by immigration officers, several Chicagoans expressed fears that tumultuous deportation efforts could upend their lives and potentially put children in danger. The immigration crackdown known as \u201cOperation Midway Blitz\u201d has fanned out across Chicago and its suburbs since September. Asked in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview Sunday whether violent encounters involving immigration agents had gone too far, Trump said: \u201cThey haven\u2019t gone far enough.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin added in her statement: \u201cOur officers are facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murderers, rapists, abusers, and gang members. Secretary Noem\u2019s message to the rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down.\u201d",
      "Parise and her daughter are among a growing number of people who say they have inadvertently been exposed to chemical agents or witnessed troubling scenes by immigration agents. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officers have increasingly gone into neighborhoods \u2014 including in Rogers Park, Little Village, Lakeview, Albany Park and Belmont Cragin \u2014 targeting people for arrest while they were selling tamales, attending church, or doing landscape or construction work.",
      "Area residents, education leaders, activists, local elected officials and federal judges have decried agents\u2019 actions in residential areas as overly aggressive and, at times, dangerous. This led to a federal judge issuing a temporary restraining order Oct. 9 to curb officers from using aggressive tactics, including tear gas, when they are not under imminent threat.",
      "In Broadview, outside an immigration detention facility, residents have complained of their children feeling the impacts of chemical agents while in their backyards, or even inside their homes. Chicago Public Schools have had to move elementary school recess indoors after tear gas was deployed and teachers have complained of helicopters hovering over their schools, scaring students.",
      "Most recently, schools in north suburban Evanston were impacted. On Friday, Border Patrol agents deployed chemical agents in the city. Citing nearby immigration activities, all schools in the district were placed on lockdown, according to the mayor.",
      "\u201cLet me be extremely clear for all Chicago media: We are NOT targeting schools,\u201d a Department of Homeland Security statement read.",
      "A DHS spokesperson said agents were in the area to arrest five undocumented individuals \u201cwhose criminal histories included criminal trespass and multiple illegal entries into the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cA hostile crowd surrounded agents and their vehicle, and began verbally abusing them and spitting on them. As Border patrol arrested one individual, who actively resisted arrest, pepper spray was deployed \u2026 to deter the agitator and disperse the crowd,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Allie Harned, a social worker with Chute Middle School in Evanston, said at a news conference Friday that the agents\u2019 actions were unacceptable.",
      "\u201cI witnessed some horror today, a block away from Chute Middle School, and this was awful. There were ICE agents and CPB agents pointing guns at community members, spraying pepper spray in the faces of community members \u2026 within eyesight of our Chute Middle School students,\u201d Harned said. \u201cThis was terrifying. It was terrifying to our community members. It was terrifying to a student who happened to be in a car and witnessed it. It is not OK.\u201d",
      "Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss said that, in a new strategy, the city's police department is appearing on the scene of immigration arrests, identifying agents by badge number and documenting the impact of their activities on residents.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only one entity causing serious violence in Evanston right now, and that is the federal government,\u201d Biss told NBC News.",
      "After the Old Irving Park clash drew widespread headlines \u2014 and outrage \u2014 including over a confrontation between a 67-year-old runner and agents on his street, DHS pushed back on narratives that were circulating. The resident exited the vehicle and uttered an expletive. His hands go up as the brief footage provided by DHS then cuts off. A statement from the man\u2019s running group excoriated DHS for breaking the man\u2019s ribs, accusing them of excessive force.",
      "\u201cHERE\u2019S THE REAL STORY,\u201d the DHS post on X started in all caps. \u201cBorder Patrol agents were surrounded and boxed in by a group of agitators.\u201d It then went on to play a brief video clip.",
      "When shown the words in the post, George, a father who lives in the neighborhood and witnessed the incident, laughed.",
      "\u201cAgitators? Brian ran out in his bare feet and Blackhawks pajamas,\u201d he said of his neighbor. \u201cI was wearing a duck costume.\u201d",
      "George, who asked not to use his last name, said he had just returned from the YMCA and he and his two young daughters rushed to change into their Halloween costumes to make it to the nearby parade. When he heard commotion outside, he ran out in his all-yellow costume, repurposed from The Man with the Yellow Hat outfit of Curious George fame.",
      "He described a confusing scene where he could neither tell if someone had been detained nor distinguish immigration agents\u2019 vehicles from that of residents. Looking on and standing beside a vehicle, he was suddenly thrown to the ground by an agent, according to a video reviewed by NBC News. He said he thought he was under arrest, but then, suddenly it all stopped and he got up and moved farther to the side of the street. His head hurt for days and he was treated at urgent care for a mild traumatic brain injury, he said.",
      "George said he wondered why agents didn\u2019t leave sooner to de-escalate the situation. He believes, based on what he saw, they had plenty of space to drive away, despite agents\u2019 claims of being boxed in.",
      "When he returned home, his 5-year-old, who watched the episode from the front door, made a striking comment: \u201c\u2018Dad, I just don\u2019t understand who the bad guys are.\u2019\u201d",
      "When asked what the most violent episode was that he\u2019s witnessed in his neighborhood, George didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201c1000% this was,\u201d he said of the Oct. 25 event.",
      "Neighborhood resident Brian Kolp, a former Cook County prosecutor and now a private attorney, said he felt immigration agents haven\u2019t been carrying out deportation operations in the highest crime areas of the city.",
      "\u201cWhereas, in Old Irving Park, the worst we could probably do is try to blow them away with our leaf blowers,\u201d Kolp said. \u201cNo one around here is in a gang. No one around here is rolling around with any guns. Obviously, in other parts of the city, that\u2019s not necessarily going to be the case.\u201d",
      "Parise questioned the government\u2019s financial justification for its operation in Old Irving Park, which yielded one arrest of an undocumented immigrant but had far-reaching effects on children and other residents.",
      "\u201cWhat was the return on that? What did you spend to have all those people out there for the day with all of their fake tactical gear and their tear gas and their whatever?\u201d Parise asked. \u201cAlso then, what did it take from all the people around here, who are now scared and completely spooked?\u201d"

      "The new Hulu drama series \u201cAll\u2019s Fair,\u201d which features an all-star cast led by Kim Kardashian, is making headlines for all the wrong reasons as it continues to be panned by critics.",
      "\u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d premiered its first three episodes on the streaming platform Nov. 4, introducing viewers to a group of female divorce attorneys who decide to leave their firm, run by men, and open their own practice.",
      "\u201cFierce, brilliant, and emotionally complicated, they navigate high-stakes breakups, scandalous secrets, and shifting allegiances\u2014 both in the courtroom and within their own ranks. In a world where money talks and love is a battleground, these women don\u2019t just play the game\u2014they change it,\u201d the description reads. The legal drama, co-created by Ryan Murphy and his \u201cGrotesquerie\u201d collaborators Jon Robin Baitz and Joe Baken, also stars Sarah Paulson, Glenn Close, Niecy Nash, Naomi Watts and Teyana Taylor.",
      "But despite all the talented names in front of and behind the camera, the series debuted on Rotten Tomatoes with a 0% score from critics, who wrote mostly scathing reviews about the show\u2019s plot, writing and Kardashian\u2019s performance.",
      "While critics seem aligned on their opinions of \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d so far, the audience score has been somewhat more favorable. Read on to hear what television critics and viewers have been saying about the trending series.",
      "What Have Critics Said About \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019?",
      "Since it arrived on Hulu, the reviews for \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d  have been overwhelmingly negative. Multiple critics have pointed out the disjointed tone and thin plot.",
      "In her review for Time, Judy Berman wrote, in part, \u201cI can say that, whether it means to be or not, 'All\u2019s Fair' is both reminiscent of some of the small screen\u2019s biggest female-focused hits and unlike anything I\u2019ve seen on TV before.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not a compliment. She later described the series as \u201ca 2010s Shonda Rhimes procedural on steroid shots and Goop supplements, if everyone in the writers\u2019 room had been freshly lobotomized. 'All\u2019s Fair' is 'The First Wives Club' for psychopaths. 'All\u2019s Fair' is a multigenerational, workplace 'Sex and the City,' if the sex were all talk and the city irrelevant and the humor not necessarily intentional.\u201d",
      "New York Magazine\u2019s Vulture critic Roxana Hadadi called out Murphy in her review. \u201cAt his best, Murphy is a connoisseur of low culture, a maestro of story lines that play out at a buzzsaw pace, a sculptor of characters who spit out corrosive one-liners and gnaw through scenery, an architect of goofy sex scenes, and a mastermind at presenting exploitation as empowerment,\u201d she said. \u201c'All\u2019s Fair' is cotton-candy TV: sticky, airy, and, once it\u2019s all gone, both satisfying and nausea inducing.\u201d",
      "But there were some positives, as Hadadi wrote that \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d has moments when it is reminiscent of other Murphy series like \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d \u201c9-1-1\u201d and \u201cDoctor Odyssey.\u201d",
      "Kaleigh Donaldson of \u201cThe Wrap\u201d was less forgiving, labeling the show \u201cterrible\u201d before pointing out flaws in the script and Kardashian\u2019s acting.",
      "\u201cThere are lines of dialogue here so bad that one wonders if the script ever got past a sketched-out first draft on the back of a napkin. When it\u2019s not lazy exposition, it\u2019s painfully stretched attempts at gif-ready one-liners,\u201d Donaldson said. She also said Kardashian\u2019s inclusion in the series was \u201cstunt casting.\u201d",
      "Kelly Lawler of USA Today flat-out called it \u201cthe worst TV show of the year\u201d in her headline and Variety\u2019s Angie Han said it was \u201cunforgivably dull.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Lucy Mangan gave it zero out of five stars.",
      "The one critic who wrote a complimentary review: Decider\u2019s Joel Keller, who recommended his readers stream the series. His review also bumped the show up to a 6% score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cWhen you cram a show like 'All\u2019s Fair' with so many top-notch actors (and, while Kim K. isn\u2019t exactly Watts, Nash or Close-level in the acting department, she holds her own), and then stuff each episode with cases involving huge guest stars, you can\u2019t help but make a show watchable,\u201d he said. Keller also pointed out there were comedic moments in the show that he enjoyed.",
      "He concluded, \u201c'All\u2019s Fair' is over the top and campy as hell, but it also knows it\u2019s both of these things, which is why the show and the cases the firm deals with are going to be fun to watch.\u201d",
      "What Have Fans Said About \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019?",
      "While critics voiced their opinions, hundreds of viewers commented on Rotten Tomatoes to share their thoughts, too. The audience score was mixed, hovering around 61% as of Nov. 5.",
      "One fan left a five-star review and said, \u201cPeople are such haters. Such a fun watch with great talent. Keyboard warriors and trolls seem to basing their ratings based off what they think of the Kardashians and Kim without giving merit to her actual talent, skill and dedication to every craft shes put hands on. If you know you know and if you dont know, take your hate elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Another commented, \u201cI love it, I feel it\u2019s a very clever show. I love the characters in their individuality and how they all bring a different flavor to every episode. I had expectations and I feel glad they didn\u2019t disappoint. Ryan Murphy never disappoints.\u201d",
      "A third agreed about the show\u2019s premise, writing, \u201cPersonally I think it is a powerhouse display of women and law and is very interesting and entertaining.\u201d",
      "Many said they appreciated the campy sense of humor in \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d and were looking forward to the rest of the season.",
      "\u201cAll Fair\u2019s Will Be The People\u2019s Champ! It\u2019s (what we\u2019re) missing on television. It\u2019s funny, fashion forward, campy, glamorous, and filled with shade and reads!! Reviews are being tough but I think the people will enjoy it! It\u2019s something new and original,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the reboot era.\u201d",
      "However, some agreed with the critics.",
      "One one-star review from a viewer read, \u201cAll\u2019s Fair tries to present itself as bold and provocative, but it ends up being tone-deaf and, at times, outright offensive. In the current state of the world, where empathy and awareness should be at the forefront of storytelling, the show\u2019s approach feels careless and disconnected. Instead of challenging viewers to think critically, it relies on exaggerated stereotypes and shallow shock value. What could have been a relevant commentary on justice and social dynamics turns into a spectacle that trivializes serious issues. Art has the power to provoke, but it also carries responsibility.

      "Another said that the promising concept wasn\u2019t executed properly. \u201cWhile this series boasts impeccable styling and a stellar cast, it is completely let down by the awkwardly abrupt writing, delivery, and poor direction. As a result, each scene feels (labored), and the actors showcase their unique skills at a rather jarring, manufactured and superficial level. The concept had great potential \u2014 backed by a solid budget. It is clear something wasn\u2019t working behind the scenes and, in this instance, it may cost Ryan Murphy the attention of his otherwise usually loyal audience.\u201d"

      "Ahead of the 74th Miss Universe competition, which takes place in Bangkok later this month, contestants gathered in Thailand over the past few days. Per the schedule, delegates arrived Nov. 2 ahead of a sashing ceremony, which was set for Nov. 5.",
      "As part of the schedule of events, contestants attended a talk from Nawat Itsaragrisil, a Thai businessman and national director of Miss Universe Thailand.",
      "While livestreaming the event on Facebook, the Miss Universe Thailand organization captured a heated exchange between Itsaragrisil and Miss Universe Mexico titleholder Fatima Bosch.",
      "What happened, and how did the Miss Universe organization respond? Here's everything we know so far.",
      "Itsaragrisil and Bosch's Argument Escalated Quickly",
      "While speaking to Miss Universe contestants, Itsaragrisil appeared  to single out Bosch for not participating in certain promotional activities for the pageant and its host country. He also criticized the national director of Mexico's Miss Universe organization.",
      "\u201cIf you follow the order from your national director, you are dumb,\u201d he said.",
      "He continued to criticize not posting about the host country and the pageant before Bosch again spoke up.",
      "Bosch, who spoke calmly throughout the interaction, seemed to upset Itsaragrisil as she attempted to share her perspective.",
      "\"Not about you,\" he said.",
      "\"I didn't give you opportunity to talk. Please keep polite. I still talking. Listen,\" he added as the exchange continued.",
      "When Itsaragrisil asked why Bosch stood up to talk while he's \"talking to everybody,\" she said, \"Because I have a voice.\"",
      "When Bosch said Itsaragrisil was \"not respecting me as a woman,\" he grew increasingly frustrated and called for security.",
      "The other women in the room were disturbed by the tense interaction and said, \"No,\" as Itsaragrisil called for security.",
      "Meanwhile, Bosch could be heard saying, \u201cI am here representing my country, and it is not my fault that you have problems with my organization.\u201d",
      "The other women in the room then got up to follow Bosch out and Itsaragrisil instructed them to \"sit down\" if they wanted to continue in the contest.",
      "Bosch Spoke to Reporters After the Event",
      "Outside of the event, Bosch expressed disappointment with the way she had been treated. In a video interview that was shared by the Miami Herald, she said Itsaragrisil was \"not respectful.\"",
      "\"He called me dumb because he have problems with the organization. And I think that's not fair because I'm here and I do everything OK. I don't mess with anyone. I just try to be kind. I'm trying to give my best and he just shot me and he just said to me and shut up and a lot of different things,\" she said.",
      "Bosch explained that she and her fellow contestants are \"empowered women\" with a powerful \"platform.\"",
      "\"And no one can shut our voice and no one will do that to me,\" she said.",
      "How the Miss Universe Mexico Organization Responded",
      "Following the incident, the official Miss Universe Mexico Instagram account expressed its support for Bosch.",
      "\"Mexican women always gettin up. We will always raise our face and soul high, because the voice of @fatimaboschfdz carries with it the voice of women of the world. Today we don\u2019t only speak for Mexico, we speak for all those who deserve respect, dignity and recognition. Thank you to all the fans, media, and content creators who have come together to stand up for what\u2019s right. Mexico does not shut up. Mexico is rising up,\" the post read.",
      "Miss Universe's President Released a Statement Condemning Itsaragrisil's Actions",
      "Miss Universe Organization President Ra\u00fal Rocha responded to the viral moment by filming a video message condemning Itsaragrisil\u2019s treatment of Bosch.",
      "\"I will not allow the values of respect and dignity toward women to be violated. Unfortunately, Nawat has forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host. It means to demonstrate to all delegates of all countries that he as a host, he has the obligation to serve them, assist them and support them, and to ensure they have a unique life experience filled with kindness and courtesy so that they may enjoy and take from Thailand the best memories of their lives, in an atmosphere of healthy and friendly competition,\" he said.",
      "Rocha expressed his \"great indignation toward Nawat\" and said he \"humiliated, insulted and he showed a lack of respect\" toward Bosch.",
      "Rocha said Itsaragrisil has a \"constant desire to be the center of attention\" and urged him to change his approach while speaking with members of the Miss Universe organization and others.",
      "\u201cNawat you need to stop. Every woman in the world should be respected,\u201d he added.",

      "Itsaragrisil Responded to the Controversy",
      "Itsaragrisil addressed the controversy with a post on Facebook. While re-sharing a post from the Miss Universe Organization, he added, \"Just finished meeting with MUO from Mexico. Thanks so much for understanding and corroborate.\"",
      "The Miss Universe statement said the organization \"reaffirms its commitment to working closely with the host community, the Miss Grand International Organization, and all local partners to ensure the continued success of the 74th Miss Universe competition. Together, we are dedicated to upholding the highest standards of respect, safety, and integrity for all participants, staff, and stakeholders.\"",
      "Itsaragrisil also seemingly apologized, per footage from an Instagram live re-shared by several Instagram users. In the video, Itsaragrisil said, \"If anyone (is) feeling not good, if anyone (is) not comfortable. if anyone (was affected), I do apologize for everyone. But I did talk, apologize to the rest of the girls in the room, about 75 girls in the room already.\"",
      "Itsaragrisil also expressed frustration that there hasn't been anyone with \"authority\" for Miss Universe Thailand and said he was meeting with the Miss Universe organization to discuss the situation."

      "\u201cBrazil, i can\u2019t believe this is happening and i am beyond devastated to be sending this message. a few hours ago, my team and i had to deplane our flight as they had to do maintenance on the plane due to a safety issue and it will not be taking off until 11am tomorrow which means that i would not be making it in time for the Wicked For Good S\u00e3o Paulo premiere,\u201d she began in a lengthy statement posted Nov. 3. \u201cMy team and Universal have tried every single thing possible to fix this, we\u2019ve searched every other flight, overnight, early morning, connecting flights, commercial and also private options and absolutely nothing was available or possible that would get us there in time.\u201d",

      "\u201cI haven\u2019t been comfortable with myself in years and also filming and just doing all that, it\u2019s not for everybody.

Their three daughters, they believed, were being brainwashed by public school and mainstream media to support LGBTQ rights. American culture in general no longer offered white people the same opportunities as other races, they said.",
      "The couple yearned to live in a place that shared their \"Christian values\" and where they \"weren't going to be discriminated against\" as white, politically-conservative Christians.",
      "So in March, the Huffmans became the first family to move to a community planned for fellow English-speakers some 30 miles west of Moscow, a project they had been following online run by long-term American expat and former Kremlin-sponsored RT host Tim Kirby. The family is among a small but growing number of Americans who have moved to Russia because the United States, in their opinion, has become too \u201cwoke.\"",
      "The Russian government has welcomed these culture war refugees. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin issued an executive order offering temporary residence to people wanting to move to the country because they rejected \"destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes\" of their home countries.",
      "Around 1,500 of these \u201cideological immigrants,\u201d as they\u2019ve been dubbed by the Russian media, including 127 Americans, have applied for temporary residence in Russia, according to the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs.",
      "\"President Putin is an amazing leader and he\u2019s done great things for Russia,\u201d Derek Huffman, 45, said in a video on his family\u2019s YouTube channel on March 9. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like you see on the news.\u201d The social media platform X \u201cis the only place where you get real information\" about America's own problems, Derek says.",
      "The family initially found a community of Russians and westerners on social media who encouraged their move, with donations from some of their 15,000 YouTube subscribers providing financial support after their arrival in Russia. But when Derek Huffman voluntarily joined the Russian army in May, the family became a lightning rod for broader online scrutiny.",
      "Derek Huffman said he joined the Russian army to expedite the family\u2019s applications for Russian citizenship, as well as to show support for their new homeland.",
      "\u201cAbove and beyond the citizenship, the money, a big part of it for me is about the respect and earning our place here in Russia,\u201d he said on the Huffmans\u2019 YouTube channel on May 26.",
      "But in a follow-up video posted in June, which was subsequently deleted, DeAnna Huffman, 42, told viewers that her husband had been \u201cthrown to the wolves.\u201d NBC News viewed a re-upload of the video.",
      "The couple had hoped Derek Huffman would put previous welding experience to use in the repair battalion and \u201cactually be utilized for his skills,\u201d she said in the video. Instead, she said, he was sent to the front line and struggled to understand his training, which was in Russian.",
      "Pro-Ukrainian commentators, keen to publicize hardship for pro-Russian figures, said on social media that Derek Huffman had been killed. A post on X claiming to have access to drone footage of his death has more than 2 million views. NBC News did not find video to substantiate the claim, and DeAnna Huffman denied the reports.",
      "Derek reappeared in several videos on the family\u2019s YouTube channel uploaded on October 25, celebrating his daughter\u2019s birthday and signing forms to receive his Russian passport.",
      "In one filmed in the family\u2019s neighborhood, he said he was back \u201con vacation\u201d after being deployed for six months, and praised his wife for keeping the family going while he was gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m still alive and doing what I can to survive, and be of service to Russia. I\u2019m so thankful to all the Russian people who have reached out and helped my family while I\u2019ve been gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Another family, the Hares, also moved from Abilene, Texas, to Russia to shield their three sons from what they say are harmful elements of American culture.",
      "\u201cIt was the promise of a country that would not promote the LGBT agenda. We liked the fact that LGBT is basically outlawed here in official ways,\u201d Leo Hare, 62, told NBC News via a video call from the family\u2019s new home in Ivanovo, Russia.",
      "Russia has strict laws against the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relationships,\u201d which have in practice banned public displays of LGBTQ identity, including wearing or posting the rainbow flag on social media.",
      "His wife Chantelle Hare, 53, says in a video on the family's own YouTube channel that when they lived the U.S., she and her husband preferred to get their news from Alex Jones and Mike Adams, who are far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists. They felt particularly disillusioned with American politics after the 2020 election, and don\u2019t believe Donald Trump\u2019s return to power will change the country enough to convince them to return.",
      "\u201cWhen we left, it was final. We don\u2019t plan to come back. There will not be anything to come back to,\u201d Chantelle Hare said.",
      "The Hares have endured their share of hardship trying to build a new life in Russia.",
      "They say their initial plan to rent an apartment in Moscow fell through just as they boarded the plane from Texas, and the family spent a bitterly cold winter caring for chickens, horses and rabbits on a farm 70 miles south of Moscow in exchange for free board. At one point, they even had to bring the goats and their newborns inside their cabin to keep the animals from dying.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainian troops have launched helicopter raids and counteroffensives to try and ease the pressure on a key eastern city, as the Kremlin seeks a crucial battlefield victory with the U.S. push for peace shelved.",
      "Street battles were being fought in Pokrovsk, a transport and supply hub whose capture could serve as a springboard for the Russian military to threaten bigger nearby cities. It would also hand Vladimir Putin new leverage at a delicate diplomatic moment, with the Russian leader set on capturing the entirety of the broader Donetsk region.",
      "Putin's forces have been battling to take Pokrovsk for more than a year, but now appear on the verge of a breakthrough with the front lines in the city increasingly blurred.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that Ukrainian troops should surrender to save themselves, claiming they were \"trapped\" by Russian forces in the city, which was once home to some 60,000 people but is now largely deserted and destroyed.",
      "It said that Russian troops were advancing further northward into Pokrovsk, blocking multiple Ukrainian attempts to break out of encirclement.",
      "Ukraine's military insisted Wednesday that there was \"no encirclement of our units and formations\" in Pokrovsk. Units defending the city had been reinforced, it said, as Russian forces tried to \"infiltrate and accumulate.\"",

      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited troops Tuesday in nearby Dobropillia, where Ukrainian forces are staging a counteroffensive to try and draw Russia\u2019s focus.",
      "However, Ukrainian military officials and soldiers on the ground have conceded that the situation in Pokrovsk is increasingly challenging.",
      "\u201cThe situation is difficult,\u201d Sgt. Liana Kononchuk of the Ukrainian unit operating in Pokrovsk, told NBC News via WhatsApp this week. \u201cWe are trying to control it. But, unfortunately, it has only been getting worse lately,\u201d the 31-year-old said.",
      "\u201cAs of now there is no permanent line of defense as such,\u201d she said. \u201cThe enemy seeps northwards by one, two, three units at a time, thereby trying to erode the frontline,\u201d Kononchuk added.",
      "Her comments match the assessment of the Ukrainian open-source mapping project Deep State. Its latest map showed that Russian forces had pushed further into the city from the south but that most of the area remained a contested gray zone controlled by neither side.",
      "Ukraine has deployed additional resources in a bid to hold back the Russian assault, including a special forces operation using U.S.-made Black Hawk helicopters to restore supply routes, according to a spokesperson for the 7th Rapid Response Corps that is leading the defensive effort.",
      "Kononchuk hopes that these reinforcements will stabilize the situation. \u201cThe logistics situation is now very complicated. Rotating positions is hard, and evacuating the wounded is even harder,\u201d she said.",
      "The Ukrainian commander overseeing defense of the city, Col. Yevhen Lasiichuk, said via WhatsApp on Monday that Moscow\u2019s claims of an encirclement were false and part of Russia\u2019s propaganda \u201cgame.\u201d",
      "Lasiichuk said that there were between 200 and 300 Russian soldiers inside the city.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to push through the town to block key logistic points,\u201d he added.",
      "Lasiichuk stressed that, although complicated, Ukraine was still able to reach its troops in Pokrovsk.",
      "\u201cOur Defense Forces units have recently carried out airborne landings,\u201d he said. \u201cThis certainly does not look like an encirclement.\u201d",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday that its troops had repelled a Ukrainian special forces landing and killed all 11 soldiers who arrived by helicopter.",
      "Influential Russian military bloggers have reported the heavy use of drones and smaller mobile units to disrupt Ukrainian defenses.",
      "While the exact situation on the ground remained unclear, military analysts said that losing Pokrovsk would be a bitter blow for Ukraine as it pushes for greater U.S. support.",
      "\"The loss of Pokrovsk would make Ukrainian logistics on this front complicated, increase the risk of losing or retreating from nearby positions, and require a restructuring of the defensive lines,\" Viktor Kevliuk, a retired Ukrainian colonel now working for the Kyiv-based Center for Defense Strategies, said in an interview.",
      "Pokrovsk would be Russia\u2019s most important territorial gain since it took the eastern city of Avdiivka in early 2024. Its capture could cause a \u201cdomino effect,\u201d but would still be a limited strategic gain unlikely to shift the overall balance of the war, Kevliuk said.",
      "Other experts said it could bolster Putin's bargaining hand after Trump called off a planned summit and imposed new sanctions on Russia last month.",
      "\"Moscow could also try to use any battlefield gains to pressure Ukraine at the negotiating table and persuade Trump to accept Russia\u2019s terms,\" Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, said in an interview.",

      "The suspect in Saturday night's London-bound train stabbing is now being investigated for other alleged crimes committed on the weekend, including the stabbing of two minors in two separate incidents.",
      "Anthony Williams, 32, was arrested Saturday after the stabbing incident in which 11 people were injured, including one London North Eastern Railway staff member, who was in life-threatening condition, according to British Transport Police.",
      "Police said they have since charged Williams in connection with four other offenses, including the stabbing of a 14-year-old boy Friday night and the attack of a 17-year-old earlier Saturday, before the train stabbing.",
      "Police on Tuesday afternoon said that a 14-year-old boy was stabbed at 7:10 p.m. Friday in Peterborough's city center on Henry Penn Walk, adding that the boy was taken to the hospital and treated for minor injuries.",
      "The suspect fled the scene, and police, despite the help of a police dog, were not able to find him.",
      "A man with a knife also entered a barber shop in Fletton, an area in Peterborough, at around the same time Friday, police said. It was reported to the Cambridgeshire Constabulary two hours later, but the man had left the shop, so officers were not dispatched.",
      "On Saturday at 12:46 a.m., police received a report that a 17-year-old \"suffered facial injuries after being attacked with a knife\" on a Docklands Light Railway train at the Pontoon Dock station.",
      "\"The suspect had left the location before police arrival,\" police said. \"BTP subsequently identified Anthony Williams as a suspect and took steps to locate and arrest him that day.\"",
      "Hours later, at 9:25 a.m., barbers in Fletton reported \"a further incident\" to the Cambridgeshire Constabulary. Police arrived about 18 minutes later but could not find the suspect.",
      "At 7:42 p.m., police and medics rushed to a train station in Huntingdon, northwest of Cambridge, after reports of a stabbing on an LNER train. The train made an unscheduled stop as emergency services responded, according to police.",
      "A LNER staff member who tried to stop the suspect \u2014 later identified by police as Williams \u2014 was critically wounded. The staff member, who police hailed as a hero, \"remains stable but critically unwell,\" police said. Three other victims are in the hospital in stable condition.",
      "Following the attack, Superintendent John Loveless said there is \u201cnothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident,\u201d noting that Williams was born in the United Kingdom and is from Peterborough.",
      "BTP detectives are now looking into all five incidents, police said, adding that \"active enquiries are being made.\"",
      "Williams has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of a bladed article over the attack on Saturday, according to police. He has also been charged with attempted murder in connection with the Pontoon Dock incident.",
      "\u201cThe criminal investigation is a priority for British Transport Police, and we are working closely with Cambridgeshire Constabulary and the Crown Prosecution Service,\" said Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Cundy. \"We have also this week initiated measures to increase the visibility of police officers across the railway network to reassure both rail staff and the travelling public.\"",
      "Cundy asked anyone who sees \"something that doesn\u2019t feel right\" to contact the British Transport Police."

      "Two of her great-grandmother\u2019s siblings had survived. One of those siblings had a son living in Israel \u2014 and he wanted to talk.",
      "Watch \"Hallie Jackson Now\" tonight at 5 p.m. ET/4 p.m. ET on NBC News NOW for the full segment",
      "\u201cWe spent so many years apart, so many years not knowing each other,\u201d Koza-Culp told NBC News. \u201cTo take that back, to get some of that joy and love back \u2026 the best revenge is living well, I guess, as they say.\u201d",
      "Koza-Culp\u2019s discovery was made possible by the Names Database at Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center. And now, the very database that helped Koza-Culp find her family has reached an important milestone: Yad Vashem has recovered the names of 5 million of the estimated 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators.",
      "\u201cEach person has not only [a] name, but also a fate and a face,\u201d Sima Velkovic, the leader of Yad Vashem\u2019s family roots research team, told NBC News. \u201cWe want to know: Who were these people?\u201d",
      "Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered approximately 6 million Jews across Europe \u2014 about two-thirds of the continent\u2019s Jewish population \u2014 through mass shootings, forced labor, starvation and extermination camps such as Auschwitz. Millions of others, including disabled people and political dissidents, were also killed under Adolf Hitler\u2019s regime.",
      "Yad Vashem\u2019s organized effort to restore Jewish victims\u2019 names began in the 1950s and has stretched across generations, powered by survivors, their descendents and researchers determined to ensure every victim is honored.",
      "How they did it",
      "Reaching this milestone was not easy.",
      "\u201cThere never was a list of Holocaust victims,\u201d said Alexander Avram, director of the Hall of Names and the Central Database of Shoah Victims\u2019 Names at Yad Vashem.",
      "\u201cThe Nazis and their collaborators did not issue death certificates. \u2026 In most cases the Jews were just killed or gassed or \u2026 no registration whatsoever,\u201d Avram told NBC News in an interview inside the Hall of Names memorial.",
      "Men, women and even children were shot into unmarked mass graves. At extermination camps, the Nazis burned the remains of Jewish victims in crematoria to hide evidence of genocide.",
      "To reconstruct victims\u2019 identities, Yad Vashem\u2019s researchers have scoured tens of thousands of sources, including archival material.",
      "One of the key sources has been \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d \u2014 biographical fact sheets submitted by survivors and those who knew the victims to preserve their memory.",
      "Each page is vetted carefully, Avram said. Researchers cross-reference submissions with prewar lists and historical events, sometimes requesting additional documentation before accepting a record.",
      "The pages \u201ccan be considered tombstones for the Jews who were assassinated during the Holocaust,\u201d Avram said.",
      "For families like Koza-Culp\u2019s, those pages are far more than data points. \u201cTo now be able to look at that photo and know their names \u2026 and to know a little bit about them, to me, makes them feel real and makes them feel like they mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes them feel like they matter.\u201d",
      "Those names have also reunited branches of a family tree that had been separated for decades.",
      "\u201cThe fabric of our family was ripped apart, and through this \u2026 we\u2019ve stitched it back together a little bit, but \u2026 those scars are kind of always there,\u201d she said.",
      "The race against time",
      "That sentiment drives Yad Vashem\u2019s mission today, as historians race to preserve survivors\u2019 memories while these eyewitnesses to genocide are still alive. Experts estimate that 90% of Holocaust survivors will have died by 2040.",
      "New tools may help. Yad Vashem says artificial intelligence could help researchers scour archival material, possibly helping uncover around 250,000 more names.",
      "But AI cannot track down names that are not in the historical record. Yad Vashem is imploring survivors and their descendants to share their stories now so that the very people Hitler hoped to erase are instead remembered for generations to come.",
      "\u201cThis is the last hour,\u201d warned Avram.",
      "Jesse Kirsch reported from New York City, and Paul Goldman reported from Jerusalem."
